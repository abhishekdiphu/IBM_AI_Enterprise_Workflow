# Exploratory data analysis:

- provide summary level insight in a dataset.
- uncover underlying pattern and structure in a dataset. 
- uncover , missing , outlier ,  class imbalance and data related issues.
- relate the available data  to the bussiness opputunity or opputunities.
- tootls to be used are visusalizing tools , summary tables and hypothesis tesing .




# Why is Exploratory Data Analysis Necessary?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a de-facto standard part of the data science workflow. The goals of this part of the process vary with the given data and business opportunity, but in general practitioners use visualization tools, tabular summaries and hypothesis testing in order to:

Provide summary level insight into a data set
Uncover underlying patterns and structure in the data
Identify outliers, missing data and class balance issues
Carry out quality control checks
Let’s use a movie example to help explain why this part of the process is so important.

Imagine you are part of a group of friends who decide to go to a movie with an unfamiliar title. This decision will likely lead the friends to ask a lot of questions. To get some answers they might learn about the cast, the crew, the reviews. It turns out review website Rotten Tomatoes has already done much of this EDA for you. It provides summary statistics, production shots and a link to the trailer. It goes without saying that these visuals will factor heavily into how you perceive the yet unseen film.

The movie analogy has similarities to the AI workflow. Before committing to a modeling procedure (in this case the movie), which is generally time-consuming, you will explore some of the evidence that is available to support such a decision. Some models can be created and deployed in less than an hour, but others can consume days, weeks or possibly more of your time. If the next movie you wanted to go see was the first in a lengthy trilogy you might invest even more time exploring.

The time spent on a project is a part of the investment a company makes to pursue a business opportunity. EDA serves to maximize the efficiency of your overall time spent on a project. We will use IBM Watson studio and other state-of-the art tools to formalize the investigation of business opportunities. At the end of this stage it will be time to communicate your findings to business stakeholders. Communicating your findings is a step that is just as important as the EDA itself.

#### Important:  For some business opportunities, a sound solution can be easily identified through thoughtful data visualization. Models are not always a part of the AI workflow.

Data scientists are largely familiar with EDA, its benefits and its place in the overall AI workflow, but this is one part of the workflow that will always have room for improvement. Data visualization and results communication are both analogous to downhill skiing—in just a few tries you can obtain the minimum level of proficiency, but it takes many years to become an expert. One challenge on the road to proficiency is the many options in how data can be visualized and similarly how results can be communicated. The general procedure for EDA has several aspects that are consistent despite the variation.  








# Example EDA Process
1. Load data into pandas, NumPy or another similar tool and summarize the data
2. Use tables, text and visualizations to tell the story that relates the business opportunity to the data
3. Identify a strategy to deal with missing values
4. Investigate the data and underlying business scenario with visualizations and hypothesis testing
5. Communicate your findings




# Data Visualization:

- what you have done. 
- what are you doing. 
- what you plan to do.  

during the  "THE DESIGN THINKING PROCESS"

Your other team members are working with AAVAIL team members on the Empathize phase of their design thinking process. They are gathering data and facts related to AAVAIL’s business challenges and will be presenting that to everyone in a playback after it is summarized.

#### Your data visualization deliverables will become an important part of a playback! It is part of one of the key principles of design thinking:
Observation and Reflection.

IMPORTANT:  For some business opportunities, a sound solution can be easily identified through thoughtful data visualization. Models are not always a part of the AI workflow.
