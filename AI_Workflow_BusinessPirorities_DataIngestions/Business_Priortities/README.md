# Business Priorities

###Data science process models
The goal of the following few sections is to familiarize you with several process models being used today. The intent and general flow for all of these models is very much the same. In this course we will use the process of design thinking, but it is the consistent application of a process in practice that is important not the exact process itself. There are a number of reasons for choosing the design thinking process, but the most important is that it is being applied in a cross-disciplinary wayâ€”that is outside of data science. Historically, learning from other disciplines has been a hallmark of scientific achievement.

Important:This course is not focused on adhering to the specifics of a process model or a way of thinking. The focus is to incorporate best practices into your workflow and in general to scaffold these practices.

###OSEMN
Before the first stage of the OSEMN process a data scientist is required to identify the business opportunities. This is an important step in any data science process and perhaps one that deserves its own stage in the process.

According to the OSEMN framework, the elements of data science are:

Obtaining data
Scrubbing data
Exploring data
Modeling data
Interpreting data
and yes the acronym OSEMN is pronounced as Awesome.

###CRISP-DM
The CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model that uses an open standard. The project has been around since 1996 and there are a lot of similarities to the OSEMN process.
