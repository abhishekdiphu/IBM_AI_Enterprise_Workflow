bcan you say dated nyou can if you ve seen rosemarys baby which like the exorcist was thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release mystery science theater has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do number on the good ones too nrosemarys baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually goodlooking as an innocent housewife and her notsoinnocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success nit all seems so harmless in the beginning nmia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed there also skull in the living room but its only for decoration ntheir elderly neighbors pop in for housewarming nalls well for about the first hour of this slowmoving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out nwhen she comes to she finds herself in darkened room with bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and big evil man raping her foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen nit seems like dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it nand everyones helping with the pregnancy nthe neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink goodluck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician who been in the business nyears nmeanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing lot of weight nbefore too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries nthats when you know your healths failing nthe only person in the movie who the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into coma nby about the twohour mark felt the same way nrosemarys baby is way too long and leads up to payoff that about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie ni guess someone put spell on this movie
bwhere do begin nokay how about with this starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in long time nin fact it might even be the worst major release film to come out in years nor even decade nthis is bad beyond belief ni would not suggest paying money to see this ntheres good chance you ll regret it nif you see it for free you could still want to walk out ngo right ahead nthe movie starts off with cheesy scenes set in the future world of buenos aires nhere we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious easyto despise withapassion characters that have love triangles love rectangles and love hexagons screwing up their life nbefore long they all go off and join the military primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined nthey train nthey strut around nude for no reason whatsoever nafter an hour of making the audience scream in agony they start fighting bugs nthe big bugs look nice even though their design is only okay nunfortunately the fights are boring since we want all of the characters dead anyway ncue more agony nthen some characters have sex nthen some more die who cares ncue more agony nthe movie ends the audience runs out to their cars vomits over the pavement and attempts to drive home nunfortunately after that torture they ca nt think straight do nt pay attention to the road and many are in ugly car wrecks nyou remember how batman robin was bad nwell batman robin kicked this movies sorry butt people nstarship troopers does not succeed as an action movie nit does not succeed as drama nit does not succeed as war movie nit does not succeed as comedy nit does not succeed as satire nit does not succeed as parody nit succeeds as being horrible nterrible ngutwrenchingly bad ni wanted to run away from that movie every minute nbut paid my money and owed it to others to see if the movie got any better nso stayed nit never got better nfrequently it did the impossible and got worse nthe movie as written acted directed and basically just feels as whole like its about on the mental maturity level of free willy the whole thing feels like movie that only threeyearolds could enjoy nexcept for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore and pointless nudity nits written for little children but children should definitely not go anywhere near it nof course recommend the same for everyone ndont go anywhere near it nverhoevens got streak going now nhis last movie was showgirls nhe seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming nshowgirls was failure but it appears that though it ll be lucky to make near its budget this movie will still do okay grosswise nis it really all bad nwell no ntroopers has about four or five lines of dialougeshort humorous scenes that are actually funny mostly from the do you want to know more ncommercials that pop up throughout the story promoting the joys of the joining the troopers nso that adds up to about seconds of entertainment and still about one hour minutes and seconds of miserable torture nim totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie nbut do admit it nso if you re willing to possibly put yourself through torture go ahead and see it and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it ni do nt know how anyone or any thing could love this movie but hey to each his own nfeel free to give it shot nof course in the interest of saving your souls do nt recommend it nbut guess what nalien resurrection comes out november th and having already seen some of it and having read the script assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away nthough opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split it ll be difficult to find someone that wo nt like alien resurrection when they ve seen it nthis is possibly the years best intense action film or at least one of the best nif you really want to see alien warfare that played out intelligently and seriously see alien resurrection nplease avoid this
bseen december at at the crossgates mall cinema guilderland ny theater with matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using prepaid passes nif there ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it nand if there ever been james bond film that not only proves this but does so by pushing it to the extreme tomorrow never dies is it nopening sequences almost always make or break action films nwhen done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things to come nthis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but with sense of the selfaware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in nfirst there hightech slightly complicated scene involving british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters ntheres definite tension as there seems to be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides nwhen the scene ends in tragedy its clear there some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else to call on for such case but james bond nthe film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond brosnon nas the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an outandout hero nhe singlehandedly takes out small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in fighter jet while the copilot tries to strangle him and terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly nits not about the payoff because its obvious bond will escape instead its the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible njonathon pryce delivers perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver media mogul whose goal is to take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons nthrough some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as way to create and accurately cover his own news nnot only is that an original idea for conflict but one which could carry over into reality nsurprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become nthe films hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in jam or two along the way nthe story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot nsomehow chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond few too many times and they find themselves working together nthe chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it nthe two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story nalthough tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue
bcall hush stop or my mom will kill nor mommy fearest nor the hand that robs the cradle ncall it whatever you want but certainly do nt see it unless you re in desperate need of bad movieinduced chuckle hush scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as guilty pleasure nchalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent postproduction tinkering it was supposed to open about year ago the latter of which appears to have given hush sendoff that downright infuriating nits too bad that hush is so laughable because the onscreen talent including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange is nothing to laugh at npaltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy welltodo familys horse farmestate kilronan njacksons mother martha lange runs kilronan all by herself and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether caught redhanded after bedroom romp with her husbandtobe nbut it seems that marthas friendly smile masks much more threatening demeanor she what you call someone who loves too much nmartha eagerly deviously wants grandchild and then helen will be expendable as far as she concerned nif there one reason to catch hush its lange nshe treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated injecting martha poorly written though she may be with little empathy to level out the psychoplaying field nwhen she delves into marthas dark side predictable cliches chainsmoking staring in mirrors praying in confessional to priest who is nt there poking hole in helens diaphragm so shell become pregnant and she does abound but its moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch nveteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jacksons wheelchairbound paternal grandmother nthe rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable especially paltrow nbut can you really blame them nthe character relationships in hush hold certain amount of promise at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity nidiotic situations martha yells at nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over compliment idiotic dialogue why did you yell nhelen yells back at martha and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blankfromhell flicks ever made nyou can see through great deal of marthas actions and lies from their conception why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ndoes nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town nif any of her potential victims thought acted or behaved like normal people hush would be really short movie nand then there the climax and ending which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with laborinducing drug normally used on horses nafter really weird chase scene martha calmly knits in rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in bed all by herself ni wo nt spoil what happens next except to say that its contradictory illogical and probably since no doctor medically impossible nthe final scene offers no closure no resolution no confrontation whatsoever nits just there dangling amidst silent displeasure nno one should like this ending regardless of their feelings on the preceding material nperhaps hush title is plea to silence its audiences likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
bwhy do people hate the spice girls what exactly have they done wrong other than perhaps offend the fashion police so what if they are not great singersthey ai nt singing opera folks its pop music who exactly is great singer njudging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that like the spice girls they do what they dosing some catchy tunesand they do it pretty well they are able to carry that into their first film spice world spice world certainly is nt great filmgoing experience nwhat it is what the spice girls are all about fun songs and lot of girl power ndrawing from number of different films like the beatles hard days night spice world chronicles the week heading up to the girls first concert at londons albert hall they get to tool around london in big ol bus driven by meat loaf and generally have fun in order to through semblence of plot into the film there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries better known to americans for about minutes as dame edna remember her he wants to sabotage the girls concert so he can sell papers nof course the point in movie like spice world is nt plot the center of the film is the spice girls themselves ginger the recently departed geri haliwell posh victoria adams sporty melanie chisolm scary melanie brown and baby emma bunton each one has their own personality and perhaps the best part of the film look like they are having some honesttogoodness fun something that ca nt be said for lot of people in films today nalong for the ride are richard grant as their manager clifford and various other characters making quick cameo appearances including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry and every once and while roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans added bonus he gets to in the words of craig kilborn dance dance dance nwatching this film was fun for the most part there are few slow segments but overly director bob spiers keeps things moving at quick pace with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background his camerawork is fairly pedestrian though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing nthe look of the film promotes the high fun with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eyecatching add in walltowall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp if you do nt like the spice girls you wo nt change your mind with this film but if you find them at least tolerable get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you nand do it quite well spice world directed by bob spiers written by kim fuller music by the spice girls with geri halliwell victoria adams melanie chisolm melanie brown emma bunton richard grant claire rushbrook roger moore distributed by columbia pictures running time minutes rated pg available on home video june
bthis independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on home videocam nit is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults tale which could have been rewarding to see in the where the mindset of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the is different story it is old news nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her does nt mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped nthe introduction of the wiseguy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tourdeforce performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray nray is the only son of lowlevel mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement nray sr vincent is now trying to make go of it by running small scale homerepair business nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open business and marry his longtime waitress girlfriend joanne sybil nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newmanb which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you nshould be aware that there are lot of things about this film that do nt make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them ndesperate to make his dream come through ray goes to loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james moriarty and borrows grand to bet on sure thing at freehold raceway nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough nthere is nothing have seen so far to like about ray nhe is undependable meanspirited and stupid nso when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets chance to sleep with his girlfriendwho cares nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do nas for rays gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen nhis buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this lovehate relationship with rally to his aid nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be future star nbecause of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn
virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it nstrangely enough on the same midjanuary weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on cruise liner nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include leviathan deep star six and all four alien pictures virus in comparison is servicable thriller wellmade and produced but since it does nt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on nbased on series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during violent typhoon nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen nonce the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted nafter turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself none survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out nif virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies you re correct nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself does nt appear to have brain in its head nthe film sticks so close to the wornout conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play nin her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it nalthough halloween was also disappointment at least she was given few scenes to develop character unlike here ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as the puppet masters although just watched him in the superb scifi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous nthe last of the three topbillers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do nbasically virus is another one of those films where group of people walk around and investigate space shipocean linerhaunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them onebyone nit is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this nas long as some of them keep making money suspect the answer is never

bwell what are you going to expect nits movie about big snake that eats people nthats what should have been thinking when viewed this film because maybe then would have enjoyed myself more ninstead ended up wishing giant snake would come along and eat me too nanaconda is about documentary film crew sailing down south american river nled by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate lost tribe of natives nalong the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda nto simply say that this is the worlds largest snake would nt be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide nif this is nt good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers do nt know what is nat the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now ni expected that fact to play key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being setup for nothing ncale chokes on deadly wasp do nt ask me how that happens do nt know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help nthis minimally helps to add sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarones plan to capture the snake nhowever this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid nin this movie they re both nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone its hard to find someone to root for nyoure supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he smarter than everyone else nor maybe he just not as dumb as everyone else nat times almost found myself rooting for the snake nthere are no standout performances here neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason nno matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway nin most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did decent job of making it look real nhowever the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences nsometimes for example the snake just moves too fast nit catches guy jumping off of waterfall for crying out loud nthen there another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snakes skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victims pained expression from within the snakes belly nabsolutely ridiculous na testimony to the films bad direction is the inclusion of scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is nin scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning showdown with panther nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panthers eyeballs pops out neeeewwwww nabove and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before quarter of the movie had even passed nin films like these sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters do nt know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown nin case like that the showdown just ends up being letdown nwhen saw the snake for the first time decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake saw was nt the real danger nthis one was just decoy and there was actually bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe nno such luck nokay maybe anaconda is actually decoy and there really better movie waiting to make its debut

bi have always been fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as the company of wolves to the crying game and interview with vampire nhis latest film the butcher boy is return to his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not successful homecoming ntold through the eyes of yearold irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar film follows him as we learn little about his decidedly unstable life nhis father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore nfrancis is the type of boy who always has lot to say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be little psychotic even capable of brutal murder nthe premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into thoughtprovoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works nfrancis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the film was distancing itself away from him when suspect we were actually supposed to sympathize with him nthis is definately not young owens fault however because he gives brilliantly accurate performance and is able to also seem menacing as well nthe fact that we do nt get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay nthe supporting characters are no help though nrea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son or to anyone else for that matter nhe usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout nshaw has little bit more to work with since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her nand singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice nthe pacing is all off in the butcher boy nalthough the story could have been dynamite it moves at deadeningly slow rate and found my mind wandering every once in while nit is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs nat one point francis is sent away to juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between priest and himself but nothing comes of it nid rather think of the butcher boy as brief diversion for director jordan rather than total misfire nhe has already proven to be strong director but he lucked out with this latest film nwhat could have been courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages to be an ineffective uninvolivng bore

very bad things is the most delightfully morbid film of the year movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that could nt help but be won over by the material nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for bachelor party in las vegas nthe groomtobe is kyle fisher jon favreau who is about to be married to the controlling weddingobsessed laura cameron diaz nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd christian slater quiet charles leland orser and brothers michael jeremy piven and family man adam daniel stern nafter wild night of gambling boozing and drugs stripper carla scott who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room but after freak accident to everyones terror she is killed nas robert puts it there are two options go to the police and go to prison or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her nafter security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body robert is forced to kill him as well okay there is only one option now nyou can forget about calling the police he says nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer most of them are overcome with guilt which sets off an even more elaborate series of event that includes much much more murder doublecrosses and the inevitable wedding from hell very bad things which is actor peter bergs feature film directing debut is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that there something about mary wanted to be nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh original and hilarious even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence gore and slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end nthe screenplay also written by berg is to put it mildly very funny and courageous nduring the second act of the film some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death which was beginning to undermine the humor but it eventually recouped itself with climax that has to be seen to be believed nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive and this film proves that movie does nt necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable ntheres more fun think in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here and has lot of fun in playing the hateful laura who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that really do think she deserves supporting actress oscar nomination come next january nby the time she is beating someone to death with coat hanger and reciting lines like stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs could nt help but crack up at how ballstothewall this film had become njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original as daniel sterns wife who late in the picture we discover is tough kickboxer that should not be messed around with nit is at this level that very bad things was so entertaining and surprising njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen there would be little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further overthetop nalthough enjoyed the film immensely let me make this clear very bad things is not movie for everyone nit is more tasteless than anything have ever seen it is more violent and bloody than rrated film usually is and it is offensive nluckily these are elements that would prefer in comedy since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making noholdsbarred politically incorrect comedy nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and safe widereleases coming out lately still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry
bperhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects nthere is no question that actionadventure and sciencefictionaction movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance movies story nunlike many scifi movies which promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is carefully constructed special effects event nit runs minutes in length and employs countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length ncontrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being spectacle of light and sound nin this regard the movie is something like card sharp nwith its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented nthe script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of far more innovative visual approach nbut like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such high degree that actual content is irrelevent nthe viewers do nt care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner nand right around the corner they usually are for the script tells fastpaced albeit frequently revisited story nas the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy nonly select group of individuals knows of the real world and particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultracool morpheus laurence fishburne nmorpheus and his crew recruit computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion nthe set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy nthe costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles nfor instance the manifested antagonists in the movie group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather nthe casting can not be criticized for the typically stoic reeves is nt required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool nsupports in carrieanne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise would ve worked from different approach nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct thrillride motion picture with little abandon and much noise nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun

bnote after claiming otherwise my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branaghs hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding better mousetrap nas it happens it did nt take long nis there more romantic director than franco zeffirelli nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind romeo and juliet required viewing for many high schoolers and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare he is also favorite at the metropolitan opera where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many puccini aria nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre one of the twin peaks with wuthering heights of romantic literature nit might seem peculiar then that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen nat first blush hamlet is far removed from romance nthe hero though prince is depressed conflicted and confused nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery nthe plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus nit is zeffirellis genius however that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace nin this italian masters hands romance is everywhere in sons worship of his father in the bonds of deepest friendship in the private thoughts of young lovers even in the mystery of castles by the sea nafter all the story hinges on ghost and what could be more romantic than that nwhat seemed like cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all namely hiring thenreigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead nwho could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and lethal weapon in the series of the same name would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language nfranco zeffirelli that who nand it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money nwhat gibson brings to the role is naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful not to mention comprehensible nhis line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed nhis movements and gestures excepting his sometimes too active eyes are totally in keeping with the character nthis is hamlet whose pain we feel whose struggle we empathize with and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at films end nglenn close the other big name in the production also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlets mother gertrude though must confess still trying to understand the character as written zeffirellis incestuous interpretation of hamlets relationship with his mother does nt help nalan bates makes believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of hollywood heavy nby and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably nof special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone nboth support the realistic mood marvelously as do the sets and costumes without any overstated effects that declare this is important this is shakespeare ni particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all the melody of wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due nperhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare definitive nand there are certainly quite few other filmed versions of hamlet that have not seen nbut if you ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard this hamlet is an excellent place to start
byouve got mail works alot better than it deserves to nin order to make the film success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body its basically complete reshoot of the shop around the corner only adding few modern twists nessentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking nits overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative nbut oh how enjoyable that manipulation is nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because absolutely hated the previous ryanhanks teaming sleepless in seattle nit could nt have been the directing because both films were helmed by the same woman ni have nt quite yet figured out what liked so much about you ve got mail but then again is that really important nif you like something so much why even question it nagain the storyline is as cliched as they come ntom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of familyrun childrens book shop called in nice homage the shop around the corner nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business nlittle do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party knows the other persons true identity nthe rest of the story is nt important because all it does is serve as mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen nsure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship nall of this of course leads up to the predictable climax nbut as foreseeable as the ending is its so damn cute and welldone that doubt any movie in the entire year contains scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love was filled with such for lack of better word happiness that for the first time all year actually left the theater smiling
bdark city is such rare treat it stunning hyperkinetic vision of place where our reality is fused with noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london nto boot it is accompanied by an intense well written and thoughtful story nmovies of this caliber and idea aren made too often and it unfortunate that waited this long to see it nalex proyas who previous film the crow looked good but couldn cover up the terrible acting or story here shows near masterpiece combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly nat times it moves beyond film into artwork nit is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the film who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live what makes up our soul nthese aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter with their mind called tuning nthey are aided by human scientist played by kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight nduring this time john murdoch played swiftly by rufus sewell wakes in bathtub in room with swinging overhead light terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience nwithout memory and strange guilt that he may be killer he receives phone call to flee as the strangers are after him ni don want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop in way regaining murdoch identity along with him nit pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography nmurdoch wife anna is introduced through stunning beam of light she is lounge singer who sings into bright spotlight nshadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine nwe see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings slow rhythmic song na great entrance nhowever film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied nthe city is nice to look at but if it poor story then it not worth watching nblade runner was popular not only because it visuals but it story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience nit is discussed it and argued therefore success nother science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice to look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy nwe re left with love conquers all after finishing the fifth element ndark city is not so easily explained away nas the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task nwhere is reality ndark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the and ranks along with the best made in the such as blade runner and the two aliens films nperhaps it the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond think because the themes behind it were much stronger nanyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write love to hear it
blook back at all the times in your life when there was fork in the path to the future nsome sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence nfrom timetotime everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how seemingly minor action catching the am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact nmaybe that where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just few seconds later nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and that why there no shortage of movies about this subject nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red nhowever they are most explicitly examined in film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after minor action missing or catching train changes the course of his life nin his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day were faced with choice which could end our entire life yet of which were completely unaware nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in way frank capras its wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths nthe road not taken approach is nt just plot device either nwriterdirector peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of character after she just missescatches train nthe audience watches with evergrowing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has family nas her separate destinies diverge and then reconverge she becomes two completely different individuals nthat woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as long dark haired brit none day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day nthe scene of the pivotal moment is train platform nin scenario she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station non board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah monty python fan who is taken with her beauty nminutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn nin scenario she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging nshe does nt meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerrys infidelity njuxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there non one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as deep and wonderful experience nbut for those who just appreciate romantic comedy characterized by solid acting script with few twists and great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less nit should nt come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid npaltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinumblond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on new career with new man njohn hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and funeral is instantly likable njohn lynch taking break from movies about irelands troubles does good job presenting gerry as inept selfish philanderer nonly jeanne tripplehorn who plays an overthetop vixen seems out of place nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and its occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than plot element none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice ndouglas mcferran who plays gerrys best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that he in npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie non one occasion he has marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into life of monogamy non another occasion while laughing at gerrys plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable nbut its not all in the dialogue nmcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of topnotch comedy nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb nthe script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into crowdpleasing whole nsliding doors grants more than just good time at the movies however nfor those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having good time
bdavid mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director nwith his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible nsome of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even concealed storyline nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right noh and its rated nincidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone elses work namely play by terrence rattigan set in the th century nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow rich aging man who finds out that his year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing shilling postal note did you do it he asks his boy no father did nt ronnie answers nthats enough for arthur who with his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts crusade to bring his sons case to court nthey enlist the help of sir robert morton notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task nit all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century nbut arthur is determined to keep his familys word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that nsoon enough sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings nso do we nall david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent nthe characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense nbut this is not mamets norm and its refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were nnigel hawthornes performance is nearly flawless nhis delivery is that of dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game nwe pity the man but we also like him nrebecca pidgeon david mamets wife who gave fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthurs oldest daughter flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as way for making up for her lack of success in the womens suffrage movement nthe winslow boy is wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants to make real impact rather than phony one nbe honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like time to kill nif you wanted to but did nt this is movie for you nit is the epitome of subtlety its powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying to be depressing ndavid mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is hell of director too nhe is almost national treasure nhis films deserve their own genre eugene novikov
bthis movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from basically competent cast neddie sean penn and maureen robin wright penn are notsohappily married couple down on their luck nliving in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty stanton eddies best friend and his wife georgie mazar nmaureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddies frequent disappearances non his return he promises her the world and professes his undying love ntheir manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows as eddie disappears again nlike junky craving the next high maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high ntheir relationship is further complicated by maureens pregnancy nshe wants the baby and the father but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter nduring one of eddies absences maureen is attacked by kiefer her neighbor who gets her drunk with her cooperation and then insists on intimacy nshe leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do not to her but to kiefer nshe lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage nhe lashes out as she expects and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be months but in reality is years nduring this decade maureen divorces eddie and remarries more solid and reliable individual joey travolta in small role nher life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her njoey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband and father of two children and stability joey makes good living drives cadillac and they live in large house in the suburbs and the love of her previous life nshe chooses her past and sacrifices not only her new life but her old by giving up her and eddies daughter to joey nbut the eddie that she knew is gone replaced by mere shell of the man he was nmaureen is herself mere shell more an automaton than woman as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him nperhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness or maybe the lack of sadness together but the movies denouement was not convincing
bi had been looking forward to this film since heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on nim big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor and in addition think chris farleys onedge extreme acting was riot nso naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters almost jumped up and down na soda in hand the lights dimming was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough ni was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farleys best in spite of david spades absence ni was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran nsadly none of this came to pass nthe humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between nperry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for its his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with nand the movie tries to be smart subject best left alone when its farley flick nthe movie is major dissapointment with only few scenes worth first look let alone second nperry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley nand farleys classic humor is widespread too nalmost heroes almost works but misses the wagontrain by quite longshot nguys lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh nstick to tommy boy and well all be friends

baggressive bleak and unrelenting film about an interracial couple steve and sam damon jones and elexa williams respectively who are viciously attacked in parking garage one night by gang of skinheads nthe skinheads beat steve then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again nwhen sam kills herself later that evening steve decides that the skinheads must be taught lesson nwaiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely steve shaves his head dresses in combat boots and suspenders tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols and tries to infiltrate the gang nas he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence nrandolph krets script based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the films producer shaun hill is an affront on violence and intolerance nthe film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one ca nt help but be disgusted by the events presented within nive seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been but david finchers film was trying to define generation nkrets film is wake up call to generation and his message is powerful one nif fincher is the kubrick of our generation then kret is our ngriffith thematically speaking nthere is not single likable character in the film nthe skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film not only because of their beliefs but because they are in constant state of fury not just against other races but within their own circles nthe africanamerican characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on joyride looking for someone to accost neven gay men get in on the act locating the skinheads lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects nthe main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge nwhat all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society nthe cast of this film is absolutely remarkable ndamon jones shows raw energy that many actors ca nt seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful nhis initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriends suicide is one of the most affecting scenes have ever seen in film ndavid lee wilson who plays appropriately enough david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads nwilsons character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly nsadly actor dave ward who portrays the character of crew will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of vicious act of violence himself at the hands of fellow actor during an incident of road rage nward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed nnote it is shame that the filmmakers had to add disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism nthe message about hatred could nt be spelled out any more clearly than it is here but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to training video than condemnation nthere are no winners at the end of this film either nno character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began nwhere american history had redemption for most of its characters no such victories are in store for pariahs band of twisted souls nit is this bleak ending that carries the films most powerful message the message that despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest evil will still be with us and in many forms and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely

bthis film is extraordinarily horrendous and not going to waste any more words on it
bthis wellconceived but ultra sugary comingofage film is not for everyone and include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion njoseph cross joshua beal is yearold who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup nthe beals are like sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical nthe beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshuas older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him nthis is family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to wellrun catholic school njoshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his wellmeaning parents nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch nthe plot arises when joseph has problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever nhis answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for youngster his age to do but that just the way it is sometimes nthis search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he does nt exist nnow that smart kid nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends none of his teachers is the kindhearted sister terry rosie odonnell who wears philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the cleanup hitter and in my opinion if she was nt big tv star would have vocation as parochial school teacher she is that convincing nthroughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic nquestion about god by the bell as it rings to end the class nnothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has reassuring encounter with real live angel blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of goodygoody nthe film ends as this angel ntells him his grandfather is all right nhis quest is ended as apparently angels do nt have wings and are approachable and god well nmaybe that for another film down the road nthis part of the film was the final straw for me could nt swallow any more goo nas this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like rose nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better nwell god bless him if he can do that nthis is nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood nits just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in parochial elementary school or for that matter about god nand that family of his they re too good for words nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place nfor those who want to see something soft without bite to it this is the one

byou do nt look at ren magritte painting and search for deeper meaning nyou likewise do nt look at one for minutes straight nsurrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and half is exhausting nthat was my experience with woke up early the day died surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue nits not silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word nthough the film is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about minutes and as it progressed watching became chore nthe only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudolegendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan from outer space and night of the ghouls nthe joke of course is that his films are so bad they re good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits ni woke up early the day died unfortunatly is so bad that its really bad nit stars billy zane titanic as dangerous lunatic who overpowers nurse escapes from mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around stealing car clothes and load of money nour thief reaches cemetery where he witnesses bizarre ritual nhe falls asleep and finds himself literally in hole with his money gone nfor whatever reason he is bent on getting his hardunearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why did nt he just go steal some more nhe comes upon list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they do nt have what he is looking for ni do nt think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made glorious minute short nthe subject and the style seem to have been made for it nunfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome nit grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up to the point where halfway through was already weary nit might seem odd that film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is ni woke up early the day died is comedy guess though it could have fooled me nunlike most ed wood films this one tries to be funny and fails instead of the other way around ntheres nothing inherently wrong with that in fact think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies to take stab at real one nwhether wood actually went for comedy in his script well never know but in either case this is failure njonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos nricci for example plays prostitute nher role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out nthomas is an astonished onlooker as woman gets thrown off cliff nwas the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work nzane meanwhile occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up nlack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature nthe carnival sideshow climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this nobudget production nits desperately unfunny but thinks its the funniest thing since plan its so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction ni hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for woke up early the day died is not fitting sendoff eugene novikov
bits been hours since returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission to mars and can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar nwhy nthe movie is shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of space opera instead shooting for the angle of feelgood science fiction drama more akin to space odyssey ni got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon nbut no mission to mars certainly is nt one large action sequence about colossal disaster nthis is supposedly thoughtful familyfriendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel nyou have been warned nof course crafting tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see apollo for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission impossible the director has the ability to create sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally nof course there also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood nthat term may be too harsh but if were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient nif were gary sinise would nt touch de palma with foot pole nsinise is wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham sure he would nt want to risk the embarrassment of third collaboration nthe academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year nafter barbecue gettogether for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet nsuddenly towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed sand tornado appears and creates whirlwind of suction nfor some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were lovely piece of art nthe team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive nimmediately second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars nlets put the secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there nit is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that trip to mars takes roughly six months nim not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind mm did nt capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia ninstead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes nstill there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the timeframe involving fuel leak ndepalmas direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space ncmon ntheres few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud nits colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists nas mentioned before anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed nmaybe even cheated nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen nothers muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez that sucked nokay it did suck nbut you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy nafter all they do pretty well nsinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as loving nasa couple and funnyman oconnell well he has couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so nthe digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive nso by golly where did this

bcasting doogie howser star neil patrick harris as mindreading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of starship troopers hugely entertaining megabudgeted scifi yarn directed by paul verhoeven who making quite recovery from his gstring epic showgirls nsure starship troopers qualifies as cinematic junk food but that forgivable when the junk food is this tasty neveryone needs highcalorie changeofpace from falls onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait and troopers does the job admirably despite its flaws nfor its first hour starship troopers plays like cheeky futuristic hybrid of saved by the bell and njane nin the distant years ahead high school grad johnny rico casper van dien signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen denise richards he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become starship pilot so the couple is broken up nbut there temptation awaiting both of them johnnys is in the form of an old friend dina meyer also in the infantry and still harboring secret crush while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor patrick muldoon npersonal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final minutes when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america killing johnnys parents and destroying his home nour weakening lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry and is dispatched with group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet where he will head up ground assault to end the threat for good nbut the enemy is far smarter more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for and after an initial walloping they must reexamine their strategy nthe exposition played like futuristic soap opera is silly but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans nonce we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous but never boring training sessions starship troopers really kicks into high gear nits last half is all gruesomely violent action fury of severed limbs decapitations disembowelments brain removal explosions and other joltinducers that are really going to please the and yearold boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly rrated show nthe creature design and special effects are amazing as expected and their interaction with the human actors are realistic imaginative high point nits nice to see intergalactic beasties that are nt too derivative of the titular menace from alien nthese monsters are appropriately terrifying sights especially the arachnids spiderscorpioncrab combo that all sharp talons and even sharper legs nthey attack in packs of hundreds and its funny scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in determined gooey mess nit matters not that they actually have laughable master plan in mind ask yourself if species like this seems capable of carrying out such plot these sequences of insect warfare are numerous bloody and immensely satisfying nthe occasional dramatic moments one cast members death the final resolution to johnnys love triangle are botched testament to how starship troopers fails to create any strong outstanding characters nthese bland kenandbarbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arms length but restrain the film from achieving higher ground la star wars where even the slightest aliens had definite personality nthe acting is decent but never spectacular most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory smallish roles on beverly hills andor melrose place and it occasionally shows nvan dien for example is limited but perfectly likeable nin smaller parts are the aforementioned neil patrick harris as johnnys best friend and jake busey garys son as johnnys sidekick the latter excels at playing creeps see the frighteners or contact but seems offkilter as second banana starship troopers is based on the novel by robert heinlein scifi writer who has nt exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with howler the puppet masters nbut the overall familiarity to the alien trilogy and the promise of great gobs of gore could act as crowddrawer nits own possible influence however might well work against it when the franchise continuation alien resurrection opens in few weeks nwe will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall
bway of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad none of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like know what you did last summer he hinted at bit growth in last years cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how he fallen for his target nit was dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the films director could negotiate nbut he seems to be trying and that should nt be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really is nt required to do much but look pretty nhere phillippe has procured five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory nits tough to believe pretty boy like phillippe as hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion nunlike ben afflecks puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that nas for the plot well that one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of rave where they stupidly pick fight with about twenty people who hatch scheme to kidnap surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she carrying the baby of painter scott wilson very well connected wealthy man nthe kidnapping devolves into laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed nbut the antiheroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit ndirected by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity nunlike phillipe mcquarrie does nt seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies know ve seen before and worse it feels like it nthe film lacks even fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich all of which are spewed before us in picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is nit features characters living by code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah rather than any thing resembling life neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc did nt like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here its even more self consciously dramatic nusual suspects which also featured bunch of low lives that seemed to live by code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential nthus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but admit did nt see it coming and smiled nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason nor substance nits just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters distinctive style or good script would be neven the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing fine job feels odd and out of place in movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever nat one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass nive seen porno with better dialogue nand some with better plot lines too nbut rarely has porn offered up such talented cast mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness nbenicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting brad pittesque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering nspeaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like silly goose nnicky katt was brilliant in brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted he only kept around for his cold presence ntaye diggs has similar function cool as ever but never character though the guy has one helluva death scene nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give hippos ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns nits vaguely tarantinoish but in bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles nyou know the routine nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder njust the other day was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant gruntlike sound that emanated from harrys fetishized smith and wesson noh how far we ve come
bit may seem weird to begin film about glam rock with sequence that includes spaceship green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wilde but if one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off nwildes philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned loosing his family and his career nthe glam rock movement in the early in england had similar take and came to similar demise nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else nand that why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began nits been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the film that chronicles what it was like to be part of the movement not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it steals lot from citizen kane and that true nin the film british journalist in the arthur stuart christian bale is asked to go back and find out what happened to glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star who faked his own death on stage bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement nstructurewise this totally steals from kane not only from the setup he interviews three people and the story is result of their flashbacks but in other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter exfriend in wheelchair and the bitter exwife as washedup lounge singer found in bar after hours nthis is no kane and it really does nt aspire to be it does nt attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like kane did and it does nt really uncover anything poignant about humanity ninstead it uses the flashbacks as form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants nthe scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped with performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging nbut the scenes are engaging though not to mention addictively campy nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era and feel that so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the thenfootage they become not only symbol of decadence but of times when everything seemed so simple ninstead of creating the world the way it was haynes paints their own world as if it were narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you ve experienced it everything else seems so mundane ntheres no outside world to speak of secluding these people inside protective globe that will eventually crack nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that contributors nblade played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete with the creation of ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music but also partners in bed nthrough discussions with slades exmanager cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes british accent when with slade and finally expartner wild journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality when he opens up his first slade record he finds naked and green slade lying on crimson blanket and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene finally resulting in leading boring job in america nhaynes demonstrates that he quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such as seemingly long sequence juxtaposing sladewild concert of them performing brian eno cover babys on fire with scenes from decadent drug party and the films most wowinspiring sequence the first concert scene of wild with his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggyesuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers major talent and another slade discovers his idle neven the brief music videos spoofs of bowies have rare visual flair that pure camp and which would cause ken russell to drool nthe best sequence though may be the beginning following the prelude sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the postmovement era nin it stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be real assasination which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet nwith brian enos famous needle in the camels eye playing in the background the scene has detached exhileration the song does nt seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are nit has distance that hard to put finger on and it seems to represent that all this is coming to quick and sad ending and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show docked in silver frock with wings and blue hair depressingly staring into the mirror it comes off as nonetooobvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film nthis movies not so much about plot but more about the way it is presented making this one of those films which is classified as being style over substance statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack nhowever for the most part the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world by using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music to play as characters in his film nthe music is especially notable nthe soundtrack which is wall to wall consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno trex and roxy music as well as covers by slades band with vocals by thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowielike nthe cast is rather impressive but no one really walks away with the film and no performances are extremely good nalthough eddie izzard as slades manager who challenges slades first manager to an armwrestling match to see who gets control of his career and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably subpar neither putting lot of effort into their respective roles nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes nrhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor for the glam rock era dying when he turned into retrogarbo resorting to life of salingerism and found in the mids to be lying around sniffing coke off the ass of party girl nin fact no one in this film is really seen as person rather than just as symbol or composite of type who thrived during the era nbales character is an especially tough sell bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood he not an extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded by the record store guys for buying record put out by poof never help us communicate with him nnevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them and others bitter part of which helps the film work since this is major piece of eye candy nat the prime of the movie they at least look the role of fashionable leaders slade with his perpetuallychanging androgonys persona and wild with his topless and unpredictable image which clash and fuse into an unstable union ntheir story of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into similar whocares attitude crossed with camp is engaging without the personal background nthe story of stuart though is tougher sell because he the everyman and when you ca nt totally identify with the everyman your storys in slight trouble nas cultural rock piece velvet goldmine is rather good but it is merely good nit never totally takes off although it has moments where it absolutely flies but then comes back down nits really nothing more than bunch of really great moments surrounded by material that could really be much better nthe beginning is captivating but slow the middle is fantastic and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that it drags the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion it could probably stop at any point nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past which is commendable but not totally so nstill it does what the oliver stone pic the doors did nt do right becoming very insightful to what happened using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems halfassed suppose the message is live life but after you ve lived it what else is the point when you ll be forced to live with regretful memories nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down

bman this was one wierd movie nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it could nt decide which genre it is nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship nthe last half hour nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it lets just kill everybody nfrom then on forget scifi this nmovie becomes horror nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones nseen it all before and knows when to expect it nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this nthen finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video nthe acting is nt too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space nthis movie could have been so much better nit had good experienced cast who deserved more to work with nthere was just nothing new here that any of us have nt seen before in aliens or hellraiser
bany movie about the underground music scene is difficult beast to master nany meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbingdown of the experience to make it more accessible to the general public nor the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh nhuman traffic new film exploring the british underground partyrave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing pubbing drugs sex and the beautiful beautiful music is an example of how it really ought to be done nthe film follows five brits in their young twenties during wild weekend of parties drugs dancing sex pop culture discussions relationships and wanking off in front of mirror while mum interrupts nthe cast of character consists of jip john simm our narrator who has bit of problem with his willy known as mr floppy nkoop shaun parkes our black dj maestro who has insecurity issues afraid his girlfriend nina nicola reynolds is shagging other men nnina herself ca nt stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends nlulu lorraine pilkington jips best mate is tired of her cheating boyfriends nand moff danny dyer ca nt seem to escape the black hole of his awful life nthe film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love friendship and selffulfillment all against the raging party background nhuman traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive as director justin kerrigans subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action nthe use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters ndialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace and the acting is confident nhowever the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed nhuman traffic does not try to explain the rave scene ninstead it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers friends and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace

nt have wife nhis assailants realize that their target is different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment nthe big lebowski david huddleston is multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor nthe next day our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there nwhen he denied any money he picks up replacement rug off the floor non his way out he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clintons favorites for thousand bucks nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he heading for the cash machine nlater he gets an

inept nthe dude and his cronies are even worse nevery plan goes awry nyou can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues nthats the story but to tell the truth it does nt much matter nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into nthe dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people you see on the street but like everything else in this film they re not quite what they seem nwalter is vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties neverything that happens reminds him of situation in the nam nwhen fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wo nt admit it walter pulls

job nbuscemi has limited role but he plays it perfectly nthe more that see john goodman the more convinced am that he one of the treasures of our time nits odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband nmore like the coens raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes na mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss ntheres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it nwalking out of the theater felt that the film had something important to say non further examination was nt sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley its not going to be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling nmaybe there no real message nperhaps its just roller coaster ride through hilarious world nmaybe that enough michael

bthe happy bastards quick movie review nanalyze this nhow does one do comedy focused on the mob nwell few years ago there was sly little comedy called the freshman which had marlon brando doing romp of sendup of his famous don corleone character and recently the utterly stupid in bad way movie mafia nfailed to really get the joke nthis time around however warner bros may have gotten it right with analyze this movie that hits its targets more than it misses and nfor plenty of reasons nthe story goes like this na mobster robert deniro finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and neardeath following driveby shooting nits these attacks that prompt him to hire psychiatrist billy crystal who mostly reluctant to take the mobsters case for two reasons nfirst of course he mobster but secondly he trying to get married and enjoy quiet honeymoon with his wife lisa kudrow and kid nand of course he ca nt rest worth for moment because the mobsters goons are always needing the shrink for something be it quick consultation or dream analyzation nfortunately the movie is played out for plenty of laughs ndirector harold ramis who also helmed the comedy multiplicity which was nt half bad keeps the tone peppy and light even if its sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments shootings ca nt always be taken for laughs you know ndeniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy giving off somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas but with bit of lighter heart scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious ncrystal plays an excellent straight man to deniros character uplifting him from such bombs as fathers day and my giant nkudrow is also hoot as crystals wifetobe who on the verge of breakdown thanks to deniros presence nis the movie perfect nnot really thanks to simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with character portrayed by chazz palminteri he comic actor too come on give him some more but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for change taking his dramatic act to new field of comedy nkudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show either nline of the movie crystal when you said you needed family therapy this is not the family had in mind
balthough had not been viewer of the rugrats television series went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with positive attitude nthe trailer looked cute enough after all nafter seeing it think the words in my recent antz review in which stated that it was the worst film of its type since the pebble and the penguin were bit premature the rugrats movie is bottomofthebarrel childrens fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison nas in the show the rugrats movie is about group of very little friends ranging from babies to threeyearold nthe head of the group tommy pickles ndaily becomes distraught when his mother has newborn baby named dill get it ndill pickles hardeeharhar and is informed by his threeyearold cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children nwhen the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story nso what did the writers choose to do nwhy they set up protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over waterfall of course nfor the youngest of children ages the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience saw this with nof course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me nfor an adult the rugrats movie is piece of garbage nthe plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm nthere is nt one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement nif anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it was nt to service more quality film the rugrats movie is doa from the start ni am all for worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful nas said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this nfor adults it is nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through nas for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring nparents do yourselves favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz nthat is picture that contains great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing
bbruce willis and sixth sense director night shyamalan reteam to tell the story of david dunne willis stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child non return trip from new york where he was trying to get job dunne is in horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of nto make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed na comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel jackson who was born with degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was child ndunne does nt believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is nwriterdirector night shyamalan had tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years nfor shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though nthe answer to that question is not very easy one either nas far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable nit was nt until the surprise ending was revealed that realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached nfor unbreakable shyamalan gave the film much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before nthe story moves along at steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving nthere are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak nalso very impressive is the films score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this years dinosaur nseveral of the scenes are driven by very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film none of the best examples of this is scene in which dunne goes into train station to exercise his powers nthe music in combination with the stellar visuals really go long way towards making this an incredible movie nif there was any one soundtrack would make must purchase this year this one would be it nthe film also boasts some great performances including precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment nwillis turns in great performance as the sad sack dunne who just ca nt seem to figure out why he been depressed for the last few years nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage njackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah nthough his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked nrobin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again nspencer treat clark as the dunnes young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film nout of all the characters jeremys is perhaps the most emotional and clark does great job with the role nwhere the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but found myself saying that was it nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending nits not that the ending is bad its just that the ending does nt quite have the emotional punch that the other films did nplus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and wo nt reveal the ending here but you ll understand what mean when you see it nessentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable nthe only real problem is that the ending does nt quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor nas long as it is nt held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be remarkably well liked film none thing seems clear though nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film
blong ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting none of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is nthis opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman nhitting the road with her hick guitarplaying boyfriend in rustedout gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in month nstopping off at nearby walmart for quick rest novalees boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there nnovalee then decides to secretly hole up in the walmart because she not the brightest bulb in the stagelights na wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store nthen the she moves in with family befriends everyone in town including ashley judds character who has five kids and still can work parttime as nurse fights off religious freaks survives tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds martha stewartesque house becomes an awardwinning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid nthis film is terrible nthe directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again nwe get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work na disjointed pacing of key scenes and time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off na subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot nan embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill ntaking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprahs book club naltogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching very bad television miniseries and wishing it to end only the remote is broken nhowever the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart nno one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk
bof course knew this going in nwhy is it that whenever tvstar makes movie its always romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters nthey were really original noriginal let me give you runthrough of picture perfect character kate jennifer aniston from tvs friends smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she ca nt have new jobtitle and the love of her coworker kevin bacon nher boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets mortgage and gets lease on german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls nwhat does she do nshe invents fiance nthen when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at wedding that she will pay him to pretend to be in love with her for company dinner and pick fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like jerk and she is the poor defenceless female nhe of course goes along with it ngee wonder if they get together in the end nive seen more original stuff on the wb nand better stuff too npicture perfect also makes the mistake of being wayyyyy too long at minutes and expecting us to like anistons character who comes off as cold spoiled bitch
bhas hollywood run out of interesting characters and plotdriven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs nin enemy of the state that is exactly right na few parts the net and few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in lame brained men in black nwill this guy ever get real role nhe has the bruce willis syndrome nthe plot is bascially smith playing lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated powerful political figure earlier in the movie when tape of the killing gets into his hands nhe inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you nknow nenemy was one of the worst films of last year nnot only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and did nt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by truck nenemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection ni know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me nsomehow quality ca nt overshadow quantity

bwhen first heard that kevin costner was making movie called the postman thought an american version of il postino nstarring costner ngod help us nwhen found out that it was not remake of postino but an postapocalyptic epic thought landworld nplease god make him stop nas it turns out the postman is much better film than had expected ndespite being set in the movie is at heart western band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back nthe setting however allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages nthe struggle of dead society to be reborn has grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it ncostners nameless character wandering actor rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem will patton former copymachine salesman turned bandit king nour hero escapes and discovers the body of dead postman ntaking the uniform and bag of mail he passes himself off as representative of the restored united states nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets none young disciple ford lincoln mercury larenz tate organizes fullscale postal service nford spreads the postmans message of hope until bethlehem finds that the oncemeek villagers are beginning to resist his rule nas war breaks out between bethlehems army and the postal workers costners character steps into the legend he created and goes from selfcentered loner to leader of the revolution nhis lie of the restored united states becomes selffulfilling prophecy postman is an odd blend of bleak setting and message of wideeyed optimism sort of sergio leone meets frank capra but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling nwhat could have been another knockoff of the road warrior like waterworld was surprises the viewer with sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble ntate is the standout in the movies large cast nford lincoln mercury selfnamed is the polar opposite of odog tates character in his debut film menace ii society and tate makes fords innocent belief in hope as convincing as odogs cynicism and brutality nhis performance sells the movie ninterestingly as tate moves from his usual streetsmart roles to youthful optimism the softeyed patton who usually plays nice guys proves disarming villain nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postmans love interest abby nwhen they first meet abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile npredictably the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero nhowever their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored she torn by grief guilt and anger he resisting his destiny the postman is costners best work thus far nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future
bcapsule bleak and pointblank just the way it should be nmakes its case with coldblooded precision and intelligence serial killer chic is relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary and one of the more stomachturning ones nive never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers and because of that had apprehensions about seeing henry ni was nt sure wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic heroantihero nthankfully that not the way henry works nthe director john mcnaughton took small budget and gallery of actor friends and created chilling and intelligent piece of work nit does nt provide cheapjack explanations for henrys behavior it shows him up for what he is an unrepentant and unidolizable man who killed when the mood struck him nat the films opening henrys friend ottis toole has sister who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago nin viciously riveting scene he admits matteroffactly to having murdered his own mother and she covers his hand with hers nthey are damned together from that moment on nhenry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun nthe movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it there scene where the two go to buy new tv nthe pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with soldering iron nno preface it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker nin scene which many damned the movie for unseen they steal video camera and film the murder of whole household playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment nthe movie itself however does not glorify the killings but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work only irritation nhenry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting nmichael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame just standing there and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well nthe producers had originally comissioned slasher film from mcnaughton but he decided to give them something more memorable and consequently the film nearly did nt see release nthe film does not glorify or justify it just shows us with unflinching coldness what henry was nim hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of victim or hero nthen again probably so would henry
bit seems that ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch ntake payback for example movie that most people seem to like nhowever its horrible schlock straight out of hollywoods vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies nit was written and directed by guy who should have done better however maybe he did do better after all percent of the movie is nt his own nmel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he did nt like the ending and had another director reshoot it nwhat crock nif you sign on to do movie then do it the way the script calls for nwhy film movie and then look at it later and say no changed my mind do nt like the ending nyoure fired nlets get someone else to do it suppose honor is dead in hollywood nthe end of the film is of course hollywoodized nwhich is to say that its happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize nin this case as is most victories in hollywood movies gibsons prize is blond and money ni miss originality in film really do ni think audiences are so starved for it that they ll flop down lot of money in hopes that movie will be original npaybacks tagline get ready to root for the bad guy promised an original idea but it was far from the truth nwhile gibsons character certainly broke the law he was character that had honor odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it would nt kill in front of children and protects his blond woman ntheres nothing bad about him he hollywood character person who could never exist in real life nand gibson knows it he spends his time trying to act like bad guy and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant nthe story involves gibson being doublecrossed by his partner who is real bad guy which made me wish that we could root for him over ngibson recovers from multiple gunshots is pissed naturally and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back no more no less nhe makes point of it that its strictly grand na real bad guy would have made his expartner pay interest nthis idea is completely stretched out ngibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with nwhat did nt understand this is the chicago mafia is like spare change to them ntheyd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him ni think they respect guy going through this much trouble for simple nmaybe being too hard on the movie nperhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make simple popcorn movie ni read roger eberts review and he liked gibson in the role because he is comic at heart playing bad guy nthats why were allowed to root for him nand its true gibson walks the movie as if he smiling at joke he just heard nbut he wrong here ni wanted lee marvin or oldtime clint eastwood or somebody who was nt comic just an ass kicker nas side note ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that am the th person to post newsgroup review of payback nafter this many reviews why would anyone want to read this nreally do nt care nim just trying to gain membership into the online film critics society by posting as many reviews as can
blean mean escapist thrillers are tough product to come by nmost are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency the thrillride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot nperhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive which featured none of the flashbang effects of todays market but rather breadandbutter textbook example of what clever script and good direction is all about nthe latest tony scott movie enemy of the state does nt make it to that level nits true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through maze of cell phones and laptop computers without looking back nalthough director scott has made missteps in the past such as the lame thriller the fan he generated good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun nthat vibrant spirit is present here shown in welltimed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed nenemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography director of photography daniel mindel throws staggering amount of different views angles lenses and film stocks at the audience that goes long way toward involving the audience in the movie nenemy is truly visual experience and that only one of the reasons its such fun watch nthe movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds jon voight nreynolds wants new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee nreynolds has the senator offed but not before the murder is caught on naturalists camera nby an extremist chain of events the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean will smith posession and its not long before he running from reynolds cronies nits only with the help of an exspook named brill gene hackman that dean is able to get to the bottom of things nthe acting is top notch and the three principles smith hackman and voight are generally more mature and excellent all around nsmith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes normal human being voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role nsmiths regular joe comes off particularly well as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not nthe supports are also in fine form lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas nthis is for the holiday crowd the hot ticket as well as anyone looking for serving of genuine action in market that is otherwise lacking

bi never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently nive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth nafter all ve never been to war ve never been the victim of any violent crime ve never really been broken hearted and ve never been audited so really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth nthen saw cruel intentions nin perfect world would be in charge of all the movie studios nthe very first thing do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with something cast playing teenagers and featuring soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail nbut it would nt just be your average jail not even maximum security installation nid have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity nnow you re probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is nthe answer is no nits actually much worse nwatching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound nand then pouring acid on the salt ni do nt know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion felt was sheer boredom nfrom that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which do nt remember because had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits

bin the sweet hereafter writerdirector atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living nhe shows us how it is nt dying that hurts but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings non cold winter day in small isolated town in british columbia school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto frozen lake where it cracks through the ice and sinks nfourteen children die and numerous others are hurt nfor the residents of this small town all of whose children were on that bus it is an earthshattering event that resolutely alters their lives nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle nalberta and risa walker who own local motel and lost their child in the accident hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm to bring lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility nthe bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose is kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives with burden of guilt is not held responsible for the accident nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice and there was nothing should could do to prevent it nhowever according to stephens there are no accidents in life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through nhe goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger nand for his work stephens will receive onethird of the settlement money nhowever it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money nhe is driven by something else something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents nhe has lost child too but not in the same manner nhis daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died in his arms as young child after spider bite has been in and out of drug rehab clinics and detox stations for ten years nshe calls him on an irregular basis begging him for money but refusing to tell him what she needs it for do nt know who taking to he tells her nin his mind his daughter is dead nthe lawsuit is to stephens not only way to mend the towns pain but also his own nhowever not everyone in town wants it to happen nbilly ansell bruce greenwood who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children wants nothing to do with it nhe has already lost his wife and he buries his grief in an affair with married woman nhe does nt want to talk about the accident and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds nto him the town should be able to take care of its own pain and it does nt need outsiders like stephens getting in the way ncentral to the sweet hereafter is the tale of nicole burnell sarah polley teenage girl who dreams of being singer before the accident turned her into wheelchair girl as she puts it naside from stephens nicole is the most complex character in the film and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out nit is also her sad haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack reading robert brownings poem about the pied piper and how when he led all the towns children away one was left behind because he was crippled nobviously nicole is that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the towns children left her alone by dying in the wreck nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in loving but incestuous relationship with her father tom mccamus nthere is only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film nof all the storylines in the sweet hereafter this is the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers if any at all and he does nt condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up nwhat egoyan has done in the sweet hereafter is really nothing short of miraculous nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks he has made deeply moving film about lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life negoyan has always been talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold the sweet hereafter is quite the opposite egoyans stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy the sweet hereafter seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked nthe film is filled with beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind nthe beautiful roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score by mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the film visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements nlike his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form blanketing whole nhe works with time as fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless ease nthe actual bus wreck itself does nt happen until midway through the film but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from distance with no graphic detail and still have it carry great devastating weight nbecause human life has become such cheap commodity in movies it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple direct terms ncertainly one of the best films of the sweet hereafter is deeply rewarding mystifying and ultimately human film
byou know never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man nwhile watching instinct could nt help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies neven beside the tarzan comparison instinct just is nt very good film nits painfully idealistic manipulative and silly ni did nt hate it its simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good nbut can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct and its pretty clear that this could have been good film with massive script overhaul and director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams nthings start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous nthe subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa and its now caulders job to find out of he mentally competent enough to stand trial nthrough series of short sessions caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting nas said hopkins is captivating for every second he on screen he has way of convincing us that he not acting that he actually man who has just spent two years of his life living with family of wild gorillas nthe character himself is nt very interesting he just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action ngooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual nthe screenplay written by gerald di pego and suggested by novel by daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems to be the point he has no time for friends because he obsessed with his work nnonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct nunfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure for they work together to make the dumbest most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live and they do so by means of brainless subplots nfirst we have the prison warden subplot nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulders progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then that fine ntheres also the prison guard subplot nthe prison guard is played by john ashton the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and he instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion nthen there the daughter subplot in which maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset lot of the time after all she is the daughter of deranged man nif some of this stuff sounds familiar that because they re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had nashtons evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy browns in the shawshank redemption nhopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs nand then there the whole tarzan thing which is more than little bit obvious through the entire film nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas ni can sympathize with that but only when its in compelling film nthis is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in which big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards nwhat does any of this have to do with man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that watched today nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting movie that does nt rely on the strength of its actors
bfirst troy beyer wrote the critically panned nnow she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this subpar film about women talking about sex nthough not without redeeming qualities this film is bad nthe basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love njazz has an idea for local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating nshe and her friends make demo tape of interviews with the women of miami nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters nthe fact that they are real provides refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film nthere are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension nin lowbudget independent film from firsttime director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid nthat is not the case here nthe script suffers from random plot developments nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from nat one point character has lifelong reconciliation with her mother nwe are supposed to be moved but since the scene is completely unledup to we really do nt care if she and her mother get along nweve never seen her mother before nwe never see her again nwho cares nwhats worse these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy nat another point character announces that she ca nt have children napparently this is devastating nwe would nt know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her nthe scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow nthese scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that found myself laughing none scene is lovers spat between two minor characters nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax nthinking on these scenes it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities nbut it does nfirst it is original nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and imagine this film gives me pretty good idea nits something do nt think has been the subject of film nsecond the interviews of the miami women are sincere ntaken together they form mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some womans real experience nneither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way nat some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole its pretty bad nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension nill give beyer one more strike and then she out nrated almost got an nc for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity
bmartin scorseses films used to intimidate me nbecause of his reputation felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks nas much as enjoyed them usually felt like missed something ni learned from scorseses casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies nfor example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on nor toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress scene of car backing away from building nagain the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing ni do nt mean to say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job nit should nt have surprised me then that kundun film about mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward nthe movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet nthe movies title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the films opening shot and watch where it is repeated nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old nhis curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of monk wandering in search of the new lama na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lamas who have gone before nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own nthe boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama nscorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk nbefore selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation nsometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made second choice neither way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing boy who could be wise perceptive leader nfrom this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lamas spirit and the future leader of nation nit is great weight to put on the mind of child nin the it might be grounds for call to social services nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming genuinely likeable wellrounded person ncertain patterns take shape over the years nfor example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology nradios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet nhe also has soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals nits nearly running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibets gigantic neighbor china ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lamas life is in danger if he stays nthe movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india nthe story does nt lead up to cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do nit just does nt fit that mold nif it were forced into such shape it would have been completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not viceversa nperhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet na mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold nthe bricks are rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet nphilip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice nfor those who do nt know of glass his music is like tibetan mandala nhis building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of larger composition npeople wo nt be flocking to kundun for its great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes warm look at the dalai lama as person non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film strong beautiful consistent look
bthere must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere nin the exotic morocco of yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the yearold lucy carrie and the yearold bea bella has arrived for years stay with the selfabsorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech nat least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact sufi sheikh there who has all the answers nshe has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip does nt seem like its much fun more like misadventure with some romance with local moroccan thrown in ndrugs worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here nin this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following culture that is far different from where they were coming from nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the with her mother and sister nit is written by the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui nhe becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as father figure for the girls nthe girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really do nt know what to make of the relationship nit especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mothers loose attitude and wants to go home nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village nit seems only that bilals charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has wife who still lives there nthis scene did nt make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also nbut doubt that nthe family is now stuck without money in backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch ride away from there with truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel nlucy takes it all in stride and has good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to school and learn something and be normal girl nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many dropout reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves nthe familys travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and vacuous life that is starting to bother her nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts nit will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got chance to see him nthe new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she could nt comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories gift from god nthe films weakness was the empty feeling got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia nthe storyline about helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism teaching that has lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like hippie and she would nt have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey nafter all the mystical trip is the journey nthe films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable njulia the cornerstone the film is built on is mother who cares about the children but does nt know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she at nthis is very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being nand after all is said and done who to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was
bin brief this film needs no introduction nif you have nt heard of it then you must have been up in space on sabbatical and if you have nt seen it well suspect you re in small minority nfirst things first is it all its hyped up to be nwell yes and no nits good film and there lot to like about it but its not without its problems nwhen saw the first trailer for titanic it was when went to see bean last summer think my intial reaction was ai nt that downright sick to make disaster movie out of such dreadful reallife tragedy ni mean what happened to hollywoods scriptwriters have they run entirely out of new ideas ngads whatever next asked myself how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ni was not entirely filled with anticipation but then was nt alone in that respect nits when it came out in the cinema to rave reviews well mostly and anyone who been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that started to take notice ni did nt see the film until several months after its release by which time my sister had seen it about four times nso went with slightly more open mind but still did nt think enjoy it much ndid yes and no nmainly yes happy to say nthe first hour or so was beautifully done not so much because of the scripting ill talk about that later but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning to look at as was camerons directing and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the human aspect of the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting nthe film is told via flashback with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day you knew that course nwell its an often effective device to use in storytelling though sometimes it can fall flat ndoes it work here nin script form it does nt add all that much to the story nwhat does add lot to the story is gloria stuart whose stunning performance is the strongest most moving of the film nher presence brings much deeper level of passion and depth to the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the film would have suffered without her nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving nits an old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but it works and jacks rescuing rose in both literal and figurative senses and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching nin fact enjoyed the first half of the film lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy to the romance nits engaging touching and very enjoyable ntheres more than tinge of poignancy to it as well simply because you know its not going to be happy ending nwhich leads us to the second half of the film nwe all knew it was coming nim sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it because as he stated in interviews the real thrust of the story for him was the sinking and the jackrose romance was merely manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film ni think that understates the importance of the romance as found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die nthe iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour nand it is an hour nmy goodness we do nt miss second of that hour ngratuitous well perhaps not by todays standards sure there been far worse produced under the banner of entertainment in other films nbut certainly was nt prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be nnot that expect the word understatement to be part of camerons vocabulary he who brought us such umm vivid films as terminator and aliens nis it overdone ni thought so nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy nno no one expected happy ending but did nt quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half nstill whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked because was shocked and moved in fact spent most of the last hour in tears nyou really could nt help but get emotionally involved whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack or that jack would rescue rose or that they would both survive nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface nthe bit where rose lets go of jacks hand while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was pretty powerful image to put no fine point on it ni loved the ending however which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and half nso we ve established that the film is powerful and moving if the last hour was rather excessive nhavent mentioned the script nplotwise its ok though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed but ve feeling that to the actors credit if anything nas for the dialogue well titanic is set in nits period drama nbut saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned ndid they really use phrases like goddamn it nback in the turn of the century ni doubt it nwould someone talk like this do ya love the guy or what ni doubt it nis such dialogue as saw the iceberg and see it in your eyes now not just bit clumsy nyes it is na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself is to blame he wrote the script nstick with directing dude nbut its more than redeemed by the acting with dicaprio and winslet on fine form ably supported by strong cast nstar of the show was gloria stuart though why did nt she win that oscar nafter all they were throwing oscars at titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee ndirectingwise cameron does spectacular job nlike said his vision was bit excessive but at least he directed it well ni have nt even mentioned james horners beautiful score nutterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack lot you do start to get bit bored with it nive finished my rant which lasted lot longer than thought it would njust leaves couple of questions was it worth all those oscars nhell do nt talk to me about oscars nbloomin farce nit was deserving in number of departments though nlast question is it as some suggest one of the best films of alltime nnope do nt think so nits certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ve ever seen but do nt think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites nand as for the fact they re reportedly making titanic well guess that typical hollywood for you
bbeing the selfproclaimed professional film critic that am am somewhat embarrassed to admit that had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently nafter all its considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago nso one day friend of mine loaned me copy of the video and sat down and watched it ni was initially skeptical that something made almost years ago would be able to keep my attention for the buttnumbing hours of its duration nbut now fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound nafter watching the film again am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer nlawrence during world war lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by thenunknown actor peter otoole as lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war nshot in panavisions famed super mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic nit is absolutely breathtaking nusing stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in theater in and watch this story unfold before my eyes nevery shot is choreographed as portrait living tribute to great land ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today nafter watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was ve got to do remake of this film nbut then thought about trying to pitch the idea to modernday movie executive okay its going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert nwe are going to need to blow up fullsize train because computergenerated effects probably wo nt do it justice nand we are not going to use any big stars and wo nt have any female actors since there no love story nyes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the goldenera of hollywood long time ago nbut at least we still have the proof to show all wouldbe producers and directors out there just how good film can be
bstarring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is disappointment and big one at that njunior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman nthese are the same men that brought us the very funny twins nso foolish me was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins nso much for hopes nschwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy nunfortunately due to circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding nstill believing that their drug will work they decide to test it anyway on hesse nso dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug ntheir theory is that if the drug can prevent man from miscarrying surely it will work on woman ndoes the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you nwell it must have to the producers of junior nadmittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off nperhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny nbut it was nt schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best nthe sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny nschwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics ni kept thinking to myself with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture nbetter yet with schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why did nt they make sequel to twins nanything would have been better than this mess ndanny devito is wasted in this movie nhis part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street after seeing the movie if was devito probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street nemma thompson is wasted here as well nwhile thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also fine comedian ntoo bad she did nt get to use any of that talent here nam being too hard on this film ni do nt think so nschwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood nwith supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make bad film nthey certainly managed here nmaybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is movie that never should have been made nif you are tempted to see this film do yourself favor and go rent twins film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devitos comedic talents
rebel without cause is such an important film in american history because it is true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to neveryone feels that they are different in some way that they do nt belong in some places and rebel without cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions nno matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present nthis is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute nin our minds we just try to do the right thing just like deans jim stark does nnot only does rebel without cause display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered uniqe pattern in its social structure neach generation looks at its past generation without strong connection nthis is because times change and in response people change nno matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in different light nthis is why stark and his friends never could form strong relationship with their parents neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this nin one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored nthis scene shows that what was once cool in past generation is the complete opposite in another nspeaking on behalf of my generation feel that dean has lost lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation same ngoes for brando redford even deniro ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly milestone in american film neven if rebel without cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for couple hours it still is fabulous film nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool nnow however the coolness is fading

bthere nothing quite like gory anime nreally and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without word being said in the media about it nwith anime common shot is watching body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword nthis is standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that ve seen nvampire hunter is gory gory film nif they ever made live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given rating somewhere below xxx nit not that it gore is unique it just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it story characters animation etc nit really didn nit was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was nit seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can seem to get handle on vampires in the movies none evening blond peasant girl drawn to look and innocent foreshadow that we will see her naked guessed early on it would be in the shower or in rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here nof course he never put no trespassing sign on his yard so one can really blame her but he upset anyway and demands retribution nshe gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren there other places to get blood from nit seems like bite in the elbow would do well enough nif its good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight nto fight the spell she enlists the help of mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is nthe vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much nyou see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he brooder who sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent nwhen he speaks it in cliches nheroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated nlater the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he bored after years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter rush to save her in time nwill we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable nin it defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original nthe talking hand was clever and think the inspiration for skateboardrelated logo nand that the best defense can think of ni understand that vampire hunter is supposed to be fave among anime fans but really don see it nit an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts nwhy nwhat is the point of that nmaybe have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny ni not prude just don think it warranted nit puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost nis there neccesity in seeing year old in the shower nof course not it done for shock nit tasteless and despicable
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned neast meets west in mulan the latest installment in disneys parade of annual animated feature films nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential nthough not for lack of trying nin many respects mulan is among disneys most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery of pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of childs discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulans later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does hollywood animated film long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such provocative manner nin an instant idealistic mulans innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending nthe film based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on spirited young woman who disguises herself as man in order to serve as her familys obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth although lent surprisingly genuine sense of menace ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disneys new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact to some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from predominantly asianamerican cast providing the films vocal work there liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudoasian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and ca nt imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karatechopping blocks of stone in two its rather remarkable that movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately its startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulans land nat its core the film is tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage nas such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work handinhand with visual purity nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulans venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroines characterdefining opening halfhour nits when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry noff to battle mulan finds herself being trailed by jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief ntheyre affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts of humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu is amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect is mildly jarring and from storytelling perspective questionable in its necessity nat training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over trio of fumbling recruits easily characterized simply as the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and in familiar retread of traditional disney patterns she grows certain fondness for handsome squarejawed young captain shang neverybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily in this film nthe romantic angle which lets the air out of the sails of the storys neofeminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like contractual obligation nanother staple of recent disney animated films cache of hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be decided weakness ncomposed by matthew wilder none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing and one ill make man out of you unimaginatively accompanying tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable nonly reflections an early ballad of lament proves to be song of any consequence serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga one of musical theatres most wondrously pure voices nnonetheless mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory with strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork the computergenerated stampede of hun warriors charging down snow mountain is wholly impressive nwhile the blatantly childfriendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film they re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable nbriskly paced with smart energetic heroine and filled with high adventure the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter
banyone who saw alan rickmans finelyrealized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actorturneddirector is bit of poet at heart nhowever for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood prince of thieves this recognition may be something of shock nnevertheless poetic is an excellent term to describe rickmans feature debut as director the winter guest nthe film has simple unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion successful whole nthe result is an occasionally haunting sometimes magical and always insightful human drama nthe winter guest is nt about resolving plot threads and advancing story line its about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages nthe winter guest does not tell traditional tale nor does it ascribe to conventional narrative structure there is no real beginning or end ninstead we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans nthey represent both sexes multiple generations and variety of relationships male and female young middleaged and elderly friends wouldbe lovers and kin nwe see expectations fulfilled and disappointed emotional boundaries eroded and truths unveiled nthere is comedy and tragedy nmost importantly much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives in this fiction can be found much truth nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year nits so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over nthe onshore wind cuts like knife and snow blankets the beach giving the terrain an alien appearance nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured nthere are four pairings and although there is some interaction between the different twosomes the winter guests focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship nthe first meatiest pairing is that of elspeth phylida law and her recentlywidowed daughter frances emma thompson nthese two have stormy relationship nthey love each other deeply but both are stubborn and willful and neither is willing to admit that they need the other nmuch of their interaction is argumentative but during the course of long walk to the frozen shoreline they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other nfrances adult son alex gary hollywood is lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father non this day he meets girl nita arlene cockburn who has secretly been spying on him for weeks nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic she throws snowball at him both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction nonce they retire to place where they can be alone however things do nt go exactly as planned nlily sheila reid and chloe sandra voe are couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees ndeath is topic of endless fascination for them perhaps because they are so close to it and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area nit does nt matter whether or not they knew the deceased nits the ceremony that they re interested in nsam douglas murphy and tom sean biggerstaff pair of schoolboy chums are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach horsing around building small fire for warmth and walking on the frozen water nunlike lily and chloe these two have their entire lives ahead of them nthey are young enough to still believe in magic but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience nthe acting is strong and believable nthe mixture of veteran performers and firsttimers is effective with the most successful choice being the casting of reallife mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles nthere is chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different nonrelated actors nand of course the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child nthe winter guest began its life as stage play in with rickman as the director nfour of the films principals phylida law arlene cockburn sheila reid and sandra voe appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays the winter guest has been successfully opened up nthe rough bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of character as any of the eight humans nin fact considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickmans microscope it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie nif you appreciate character studies the winter guest is solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater

from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it has nt worked since the million dollar movie has yet to break million nto each its own however since monkey bone is not only bad movie all together but technically wellmade na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder nwhen stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in freak car accident you ll see stu goes into coma and while in his coma stu travels to guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life npeople are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them nwhen stu spots monkey bone whom he really ca nt stand he tries to keep him under control nmaking new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life nwhen monkey bone and stu steal pass monkey bone becomes trader and takes it and goes into stus body nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or nsomething like that nrather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development nfor instance we really do nt get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha story behind her but we are not given chance to know her nthe cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast ndave foley is nt given enough to do as well as will graces megan mullally who can be funny nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being total bust nthe special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable for nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really do nt realize that he is animated but non occasion it sneaks up on you nthe direction by henry selick is good but at times he does nt know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff nits too bad really monkey bone could have been real good movie but with its heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role nfor those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one

brichard gere is not one of my favorite actors nhowever like courtroom dramas and this film looked good enough to take chance on ni was nt disappointed nit was nt great film but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns none thing what with the title nnot only is it extremely forgettable it does nt really have much to do with the film as far as could determine nin the long run it will probably hurt the film as people wo nt be able to think of or remember it nmartin vail richard gere is grandiose defense attorney nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drugdealers nonce he sees that the accused killer of prominent chicago archbishop is babyfaced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press hell get nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is former lover janet venable laura linney nvail himself is former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well by john mahoney frasiers father on the tv series nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces nwe see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail nrichard gere does fairly good job nat first he appears to be money and attentiongrabbing lawyer with no consideration of the truth nbut we see another side as he becomes seeker of justice and comes to believe in his client nalfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in standard role nlaura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable nher relationship with vail is believable their verbal fencing adds to the film nthe actor who playes vails investigator unfortunately do nt remember his name is quite good nhis female assistant she looked very familiar but ca nt remember where ve seen her was also capable but unspectacular nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton nhe was excellent as the timid altarboy turned alleged butcher boy of st mikes ni was impressed by the depth of the plot there are redherrings and deadends that in lesser film would lead to predictable ending ni liked the plot twists the film took and most of the supporting characters thus give primal fear respectable rating
bsatirical films usually fall into one of two categories longterm satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on large scale dr nstrangelove situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene men in black nwhats unique about wag the dog is that it does nt necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time nthe result is clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander bit nif there anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness nin this age of information and technology we ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it nwe need the media to bring us the most uptodate news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related could nt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all nthats the idea conrad brean de niro professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election nbrean along with the presidents top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss hoffman nthey pitch him an idea to produce the image of war with albania its country no ones heard of so they people will buy it nsoon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play nwere inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in number of experts to help manage the situation such as folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and modern style expert known as the fad king leary nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news nthe characters dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque nfor example one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying poor albanian refugee nmotss ordered kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with dozen different dogs nsince its all computerenhanced anyway she ends up cradling bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later nthis demonstrates the films ability to take relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise nbut then there the gags and oneliners that although are humorous seem little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name or whenever problem emerges always responding with this is nothing nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens nthe first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film nevery ten minutes or so new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners nhowever it does have tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something bit off the subject nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture nwhat had started off as brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in movie nstill the situation comedy is quite funny especially montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt nwillie schumann war hero motss and brean concocted ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect nhowever in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes nthen again its valiant effort

bin an insiders look at scandalridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clintons campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship nnow the book primary colors has been made into movie directed by mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems to be more relevant than ever nbut the film is more than diatribe against or paean in praise of the president nit is fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics njack stanton john travolta is the governor of small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination nhe is charismatic but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign and strains his relationship with his wife susan emma thompson nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of civil rights leader who is swept away by stantons ideals and helps to organize the campaign nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney ngovernor stantons past repeatedly pops up to haunt him fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses to his advantage nto help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in truly boisterous performance ntravolta does fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray little nemma thompson delivers strong performance as his suffering wife who ca nt let anything show that might hurt the presidential run nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as democrat and there are few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues nin fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house nrather than issues the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control nalthough the film strays into some obviously nonclinton territory it is difficult to completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the presidents current troubles nprimary colors chief problem is its length nit runs about minutes too long nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut nfor example midway through the film the candidate gives speech to an assembly of laid off machinists nthe scenes only apparent purpose is to establish stantons character which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film nthe extra length is nt long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent film nrepublicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors nits funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process

bhere is film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for loop nokay it is nt quite original considering it is sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the and and some even become them nhowever as we learned with the smallbudget horrorscifi film sometimes expectations can be shattered na lot of criticism has gone against this film from what have read so far anywayyep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash nbut the thing is it is nt nits well made well acted and quite intelligent ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film nbut the species series is nt about the lack of these elements nits about how much it can get into one film nand yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so nspecies ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe nmany films especially scifi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the films needs nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars naboard is patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut npatrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed nwell it would seem that he has succeeded nlanding on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so nof course he is nt the first ever nabout billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life nnow of course the red planet is cold and rocky nno life lives on it nthat is no visible life npatrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground nhe takes them aboard and puts them in storage nunfortunately one of the samples contains form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship njust prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they ca nt even remember nthey blame it on technical malfunction nback on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible nas we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet nhowever the children that are bred are halfhuman as their father is npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge neve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien nhowever this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant nthe project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable nsince she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again nand it has nstorywise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey love the film but you ca nt tell me it was strong on story nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not living creature that created it nthe script uses this effectively but also manages to provide wellbalanced plot nbeginning with the first man on mars something have always dreamed of seeing was hoping that the film would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie nand it does it quite well nthe characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do nthe only character that seems little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does nthere are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects nthe special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad nbut for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children nalso the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someones head being blown off nhowever some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including menage troi that is all but necessary nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence nhowever tend to disagree nwhat were the alien films about nand if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us would nt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for mate in grocery store ni did nt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film nit is vast improvement over the first film at least nthe acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens nokay so it is nt that good ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his overthetop impersonation of general makes him annoying and distracting nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in cage nhowever she does manage very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent noh yeah and she quite fun to just plain watch nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film nmichael madsen is soso but he is nt annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality njames cromwell has small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with more incapable actor nas say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film more downtoearth feel nand of course justin lazard nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but think he is effective nsure he is wooden but is nt that what his character is like nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couples acting nspecies ii is rated for strong sexuality scifi violencegore and language nthis is definitely an rated film that young kids should not see nmore than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives nhell do nt even know if will nwhat is sure to be critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year ni probably wo nt see another film where was expecting so little and got so much for quite while ndirector peter medak has crafted very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of mediocre series nmedak has also mastered the wonderful jump nmoments and has probably the second scariest moment have ever seen on film scream still has the first nstrong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and surehanded director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining
bi was anxious to see this for long time na friend of mine recommended this to me because he has crush on neve campbell and he wanted to prove that she as hot as he thinks he is nhe proved it for me all right but the reasons enjoy this film go way beyond that nscream treads on familar ground horror movie with as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who ca nt act who always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door nits very familar your typical horror film nso why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original nbecause it treats itself as if it has nt been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff nthis raises another question how does it do this nsimple the characters ntheyre not your typical stupid horror film victims who do nt know what the hell to do when being chased by guy in ski mask and machette nthey are horror fans they know how stuff happens in horror movie they know what to do and what not to do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times nyou can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready to watch video and some guy who sounds like killer calls her up to play game with her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed nshe knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions she just ca nt answer his final question what door am at nand that gets her killed nthat scene works because in normal horror film half the things that happen in that scene would never happen nthe plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student who mother was killed year ago tommorrow is being stalked by killer who previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is suspect including sidneys boyfriend billy loomis nbut as said before these people know how horror movies work and that what makes it so appealing nthat and the references to horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked nwhich is obviously director wes craven who does good job of poking fun of the genre that made him legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidneys friend mentions the director wes carpenter which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven but also director john carpenter nthe cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off good heroine and unlike most horror film heroines she can act drew barrymore does good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film and david arquette is impressive nalso good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal ni took half point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidneys rival because she covered her mothers disappearance ni hate that show hate those actors ntheyre untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough but suppose he is nt
brun lola run german import that gained stellar reputation at the sundance film festival is dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance nfor berserk and retroactive minutes of nonstop movement we follow fieryhaired heroine named lola franka potente as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve marks in time to save manni moritz bleibtreu from being killed by the dealer nbut in something of pseudo groundhog day approach director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal nin these trio of episodes we gradually learn the unique effects of fate for even if tiny changes are made in lolas journey the future can be seriously altered nrun lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix in that each film takes you through supercharged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways nin addition all three movies have visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack nlola is no exception with stylish quickflash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the getgo ntykwers world is landscape of mood and color with brilliant shades of red and pink including lolas fiery hair used as effective symbolism throughout nwith its visual style and mindblowing pace run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year neven more so when considering the fact its all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an minute time period nas heroine potente does little more than run wildly through the streets as the title suggests but she has certain flair and charisma nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually track star nmeanwhile bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola and the outcome is ultimately rewarding several twists and turns are unique and unexpected nthe other characters lola runs into both purposely and inadvertently include her banker father herbert kraup and friendly security guard armin rohde but aside from the two leads no one has more than few minutes of screen time nadditional stars that could nt possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy who are both responsible for the films eyecatching visual elegance nrun lola run is subtitled so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightningfast dialogue occasional sections of it are especially fast nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation nmost are just chess pieces in tykwers elaborate game of visual presentation and he never really makes significant move with any nbut the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in few elements of the screenplay na few petty gripes aside this film is wild exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring talky character studies nperhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny it also delivers whiteknuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character run lola run is exhausting

first rule of fight club is do nt talk about fight club nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly its not even worth mentioning ndirector david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge nwith crude humor an intolerable script and hours and minutes of pure torture surprised did nt walk out nthis just goes to show that hype kills nits very rare that film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception nthe story goes like this nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at session that he also attended napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain nwhy any person would think of such thing is beyond me but things do get worse nnorton is soon assigned to job that calls for traveling and its on plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt nthe two men develop bond and go out to bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight nhow do they come up with this stuff nanyway their fighting catches other pathetic losers attention and club is formed nout of all this mess there manages to lie message nfincher shows us that society is like robots nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others ncall me crazy but this is common knowledge ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably neven with two good actors and solid actress they only manage to weaken the story ni could nt help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into bloody pulp nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention ni guess brad pitt was right for this role because felt like beating him up myself nhis bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his million fee nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose nshe just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left nthis continues for what seems like hours nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what think might be the end nunfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom nthough the conclusion kept my interest for mere minutes it backs down again and continues to move at snails pace non side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn lesson nconcentrating on the atmosphere or particular key moment wo nt do any good if everything else is in need of support nalso afraid that immature men might respond to the films violence nthe last thing the world needs is people praising leader of pointless cult nwhen the film ends just glad to get home and take some advil nyoull either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so ing stupid
bsalaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation nproof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as courier for gangster none day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired non the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms bad name nmartin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway nunfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film

bsteven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits like jurassic park and oscar awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list nhowever in the spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories none of them is close encounters of the third kind extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle nunfortunately it had bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars nalthough both films have lot in common groundbreaking special effects brilliant score by john williams their future was different one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow nwhen spielberg began work on that project he was already established as bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit jaws ntogether with other young directors of his new hollywood generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius he exploited the great creative freedom of when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment nironically it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of blockubuster philosophy nbut in the mid many things were different spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie nalthough very personal spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book ufo experience by dr allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot nthe story begins with one of such incidents team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary richard dreyfuss power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed with his experience nbecause of his obsession he loses his job family and sanity but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction nin the meantime the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and government in cooperation with the french led by lacombe francois truffaut begin with the preparation for ultrasecret project nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects nthe slow gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents close encounters is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale nbut instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big magnificent and wonderful is about to happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end nthe last sequence with its even in this age impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouths open none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism naliens who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is beginning of something wonderful nit is very ironic when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind nspielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public nbut even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions nthere lies the main and probably the only flaw of this great picture lack of conflict and consequently lack of drama nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcocks north by northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government aliens are the good guys ndespite such shortcomings the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as ordinary yet nice guy who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in grand finale nmelinda dillon was on the other hand nominated for oscar as struggling mother yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie napart from visual wonders of this film spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both as the element of plot and as the basis for his score nthe aliens who are the main subject of this film were visually very convincing ntoo convincing one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said naccording to him the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people with big eyes was so accurate that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos nso they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien this time designed to be anything but the real life nthe result was for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts nanyway whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema
bin the company of men made splash at the sundance film festival because in year plagued by brothers mcmullenstyle earnestly shallow genx angst pictures it seemed to be actually about something nit

hype waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein reside and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about ndoes men live up to its press nwell yes it does nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office nfor the uninitiated newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to remote branch office for six week assignment nchad and howard are archetypes examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business nchad is the blond golden boy genetically engineered for success the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder nhoward is chads boss but he is weaker of will the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in drab airport lounge nthere chad suggests scheme worthy of shakespearean villain he and howard will find vulnerable single woman at the branch office woo her simultaneously win her love and then dump her nthe reason nboth men have recently been dumped themselves and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex it ll restore little dignity to our lives he says nhoward helpless against the force of chads will agrees to the plan nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine stacy edwards fragile deaf woman working as temp nchad moves in for the kill flashing his golden boy smile plying christine with lunch then flowers then dinner nhoward follows suit though his efforts are in contrast hamhanded and desperate nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men christine dates them both nyou can guess which one she falls for nsoon tragic lovers triangle develops christine loves chad chad loves himself and howard loves christine on the grounds that since she handicapped and shy she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high does it nin chad writerdirector labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to filmhannibal lector may eat human flesh but chad is an eater of souls nhis evil is as subtle as vipers and as easy as his smile nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he backstabs coworkers humiliates his subordinates and works his deadly venom into christines heart nhis character would be joke if he was nt so chillingly real all of us have worked with chad and some of us may be him nhes the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness nif one of his coworkers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with bag full of handguns he had best have his escape route clearly in mind npolitics is his game and the modern cubiclefilled office is his playground nmen wears the guise of black comedy but it functions best as allegory nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company then forces him to prove it in manner wo nt describe nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril ncould it happen in the real world nprobably not ntaken as allegory however it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society nmaybe its just the english major in me but chad in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard can be seen as symbol of unbridled capitalism of greed without conscience nthe entire film is metaphor for social darwinism only the strong will survive nthe marvel of labutes multilayered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way nbut does the film work as entertainment nits darned funny in spots particularly in the mens room scenes which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions nit works less well as drama since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers nstacy edwards gives measured dignity to christine and succeeds in making us care for her but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her nlikewise chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions nby the end of the film you ll feel as if you ve met genuine monster in chad perhaps we can also classify men as horror film ncertainly those expecting conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed nbut the picture is often mesmerizing and the script is work of fine craftsmanship which makes it well worth your time nlike all good films it offers myriad of parallels to the outside world nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph could nt help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs nthere may be little bit of chad in all of us but some of us have taken chadness to the level of art
bat first was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before saw the film nnow my view has completely changed nits time to embrace for impact because this is very bumpy ride nthe story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at convention nthey meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris robin sachs nof course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves nthus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians nthe movie plays like really bad star trek episode in fact its worse ni do nt even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly its just not funny nall the jokes are basically collected observations from the series none such continuous joke involves simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series ncreative jokes like this may seem like clever idea but not when they are used to death na person can only take so much nwe do not need to be tortured especially when you have to pay for it nits pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful nits not like expected an oscar worthy performance form him but few laughs would have been helpful nspeaking of acting fine talents were wasted as well nsigourney weaver was here to show cleavage well at least it worked nits pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage nit just shows you how disgraceful the film really is nalan rickman however was not so lucky nafter his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess nits just shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away nwhen the film could nt get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up nlike many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting to name few they rely heavily on effects to help boost the films box office results ntimes it works but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk nwhen will it stop ni am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash nit may look fine and dandy but we need to at least have story nis that too much to ask nobviously it is nwhen galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands naside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic its an embarrassment to the cast and its embarrassing to the science fiction genre nits not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining nthe only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond
bheres word analogy amistad is to the lost world as schindlers list is to jurassic park nin after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindlers list as the directors penance as if there was need for him to apologize for making crowdpleasing blockbuster nnow after threeyear layoff spielberg is back with vengeance nonce again his summer release was special effectsloaded actionadventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers nnow following his pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity nthat film is amistad nalthough not as masterful as schindlers list amistad is nevertheless gripping motion picture nthematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls little short is in its emotional impact nwatching schindlers list was powerful almost spiritual experience nspielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered threeplus hours later naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since namistad while fine example of film making is not as transcendent nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts that not surprise nhowever the event is part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order nseveral mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the films dramatic force non the whole while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired none stormy night during the summer of the men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape nled by the lionhearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey nthey are tricked however and the la amistad which makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy nthe first men to come to the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey property attorney of little repute naided by advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwins cause ncurrent president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager to please southern voters and year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behindthescenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free nat its heart amistad is tale of human courage ncinque is heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to nhe is free man not slave and while he recognizes that he may die as result of his struggle he will not give it up neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in battle of ideologies nthey are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movies success nto amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans pointofview detailing their occasionallyhumorous observations about some of the white mans seeminglystrange rituals nthe larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as subhuman so the proslavery forces of amistad use similar defense nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property nin sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything namistads presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history nfour claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an americanspanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned to them nbaldwin must counter all of these claims while facing challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of relationship he develops with cinque neven though attorney and client are divided by language barrier they gradually learn to communicate naside from cinque who is fullyrealized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is topnotch nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image to become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly welldefined outside of his role in the la amistad case nlikewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nnigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election nfinally there anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done nhopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as serial killer an emotionallycrippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams nhis tenminute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindlers list is this films lack of welldefined human villain nschindlers list had ralph fiennes superblyrealized amon goeth who was not only threedimensional character but personification of all that the nazis stood for nthere is no such figure in amistad nthe villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary nit is to spielbergs credit that he has fashioned such compelling motion picture without prominent antagonist namistads trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters author barbara chaseriboud has cried plagiarism charge denied by the film makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain with spielbergs rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history
bwhen originally saw the trailer for analyze this few months ago must admit thought it looked kind of lame nand then when the commercials started popping up week or two ago thought it looked outright bad nbut then when analyze this finally opened few days ago an odd thing happened nit got great reviews ncritics were proclaiming it hilarious and deadon parody of mob movies nwell with praise like that figured it must be good and so headed off to the theater nyou know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts nwell turns out that expression is more valid than ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted ndont get me wrong think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here ni think the problem is he did nt quite know how to approach this material nhe plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama nif he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been lot more successful nas it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others nthis does nt work nit creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know its him nand the movie is badly paced too nit never takes off nit just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum ni think the blame for this should be placed on the script nits obvious the writer had good idea for movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of psychiatrist but once this is established the movie does nt really go anywhere nthe formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues nthis formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie nive said it before and ill say it again the only thing that matters to me in comedy is whether or not its funny nif analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting would nt have bothered me ni would have been too busy laughing to notice nbut as it is only chuckled few times nthe only really funny scene is deadon parody of the godfather nsadly though do nt think anyone in the audience saw it with realized it was parody because was the only one laughing nbut my sense of humour have come to realize is vastly different from the general population ni loathed there something about mary yet loved baseketball nnow if you want movie that think is funny go out and see office space nits full of genuine laughs and wo nt leave you glancing at your watch every minutes as analyze this did

bone of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel nthat concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century nhowever the big granddaddy of time travels wells novel the time machine was nt written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences nthe author wells merely used it as convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour nwhatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration nfirst of them was george pal who in directed film which would through the years become genre classic of its own nthe plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension time nat the eve of the new th century george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention machine that would enable him to travel through time nthey are skeptical but that does nt prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future nat first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars nfinally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions nwhen he finally reaches year ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of by unseen machines nbut weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon by morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times nfor wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie neven the modern audience which would be tempted to discard the film as oldfashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era ncompared with the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as good example how to make intelligent thoughtprovoking films nof course since this is hollywood product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness nfor example it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today nsome of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing nbut on the other hand the film is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely oldfashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture nthe acting is good with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as georges trusted friend filby nyvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role nhowever despite all those flaws the time machine is very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality sciencefiction films sorely miss these days

bnear the end of analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king nthe following year saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from studio other than the magic kingdom twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia nat best that all it was sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry nin however things have been decidedly different nthere have been number of pushes on disneys death grip on the market and fiftyone weeks into new champion has emerged ndreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed nthe other two contenders warner brothers quest for camelot and disneys own annual entry mulan lacked inspiration and drive respectively nalthough camelot was borderlineabysmal and ca nt really be considered shot at the title mulan had the makings of winner nunfortunately it was saturated with traditional disneycute animation and lost points against the rapidlychanging face of the competition nin making the prince of egypt dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created genuinely unique product nthe animation is flawless and aside from bugs life is the bestlooking movie to date nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects and the dd combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with nthe key to success however was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as method of advancing the plot nnamely some of the most important action sequences like the parting of the red sea were done almost entirely in ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success and that they re capable of challenging disney nthe story is also wellwritten and the characters voiced with talent nfor the most part the plot follows its source material the book of exodus although only in the most general sense nthe writers took few creative liberties and most do not damage the story in any way nin fact the shakespearean relationship between moses val kilmer and the pharaoh rameses ralph fiennes makes the story more interesting if anything nmoses hebrew is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in basket on the nile he floats into the pharaoh seti patrick stewart palace and is taken in by the royal family nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves nby this time rameses is now pharaoh and the two brothers now on opposite sides of the line face off in battle of wills and divine intervention nthe cast of voices is most impressive and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock jeff goldblum danny glover and steve martin nthe script does not have lot of oneliners in it and god is reduced to voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams but overall the story is exciting and interesting nits decidedly for an older crowd and the tykes who have nt had few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost nbut for those who make the bid the prince of egypt can be great watch

bi was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that stopped into my video store to rent some movies nluckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ni knew it was going to be bad print with only halffaces and poor sound quality but could nt help myself ni got it nwell after watching it it indeed was bad print was glad did nt dish out to waste three hours of my time sitting in bad theatre watching bad movie nthis movie really sucks nit had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy nfor example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days njackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail nthe songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagars and the direction is the worst of all nthe comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up ni did nt even finish the movie ni could nt take it anymore nnote but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director guess you like this movie nits practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff naditya panscholi is the sidekick again was going to give it zero but personally like jackie shroff so loosened up little nhe looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it was nt his best was the only saving grace of the movie
bwhats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie nthe garbage known as snuff films nnothing right nwhats to like about film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography nwell nothing nso why make it hollywood ntheres no reason why the average sane moviegoer will be interested in such topic nno one is going to enrich their life or have good time by watching material such as this nthe lack of quality filmmaking in mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting castall reputable nbut joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again nlike paul schrader schumacher has his moments but they re few and far far nbetween nbasically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it nwhy not walk out nwell this would nt be thorough review about thoroughly bad movie nheres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of mm nfirst thingif you do nt heed my advice then understand what you re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud nits not easy to watch ni did nt know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now nthe ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as surveillance expert and private investigator na rich old woman discovers snuff film in her late husbands safe nshe calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be young girl did nt it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead nshes horrified that her husband would have owned such film in mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find nfamilyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder nlet me backtrack for moment nsee snuff films are pornos with violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead nhowever the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference nvery sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies nthe thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ill swallow my bile and move on nwelles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry nyoud think he sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him nhe comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze nafter lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films nskip ahead skip ahead skip ahead nled by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and startorturer machine christopher bauer they have big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue nthe movie does nt end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome vigilante nthis film does nt draw you in nit keeps you about miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close nit is possible to like film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie seen but it takes large measure of restraint schumacher has none and larger amount of talent schumacher has little nby those jabs not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment nfor guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled na good screenwriter and good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter nwriter andrew kevin walker did nt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for twisted thriller seen ndirector schumacher does nt have that innate ability to make you watch things you do nt really want to see like better directors are capable of doing nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we do nt see is more frightening than what we do especially when its scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered nhowever gratuitous is joels middle name nhe must think that not flaunting hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint nno he does nt go that far but we see enough unpleasantness nhe does nt leave much to the imagination nits manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of murderous vigilante nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha ncraft ncase in point shot of christian fellowship bus good right ndrives away to reveal one of the villains bad right nsee no nsubtlety ndoes joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery nwho do we root for in this mess nis there anybody out there nits not all the directors fault though nwhy did the actors sign up for this nnicolas cage is an oscarwinner for cryin out loud nif he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda nwhat is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears nvillainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy nand what is james gandolfini doing in this trash nhe was so solid as concerned father in civil action ni guess ol nic pete and jim were promised mountain of money or ntheyre suckers nor they just do nt care nthere are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland ncatherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells nbaby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet nthe mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous mm film is not too bad as woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter nthis film has an appropriate bluetoned washedout look like payback which was much better movie nthe editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times its rough nduring some conversations closeups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts are nt good and whose timing was halfsecond off nsuch technical error indeed stands out nspeaking of standing out do nt believe the misleading trailers ntheres not much action here noccasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe nafter seeing mm may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again nis that positive nwell if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing dirty movie again is their motive they ve done swell job here nitll be long time before give schumacher film another chanceunless lose my mind and become seriously depraved nbut today not depraved so ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it nim sure that somewhere right now there some pretty sick crap going on but that does nt mean need to know about it nyes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there nyes mr walker the proverbial monster does nt look like we expect him to nyou said all that in nmove on nthis film serves no purpose nit does nt entertain it does nt teach us anything it does nt make statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach nonly if this film awakens the authorities to find way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile nthats not likely to happen though so mm is indeed scummy waste of money norson welles said years ago in tribute to film to movies to ngood movies nif only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in hole nlike snuff films mm should never have been made nnow excuse me while go try to forget ever saw it nuseless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme nhe used it in batman forever in batman robin in time to kill in falling down and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made nit takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story that totally believable throughout nthis is nt an overthetop action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story with real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly nharrison ford stars as dr richard kimble man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in straightforward manner nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimbles perspective nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimbles wife helen sela ward was murdered nwe do nt get to see who the killer is until much further into the story nin fact we might even have little doubt about kimbles innocence ourselves nthe film does nt spend much time on the details of kimbles trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to fantastic train wreck nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful to watch nthis movie is so incredible because its able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives nfrom the moment he appears we know huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other nmost of the film deals with richards complex investigation as he tries to find the onearmed man who killed his wife nford does not have lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohys script and daviss outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down nat one point they run into each other and great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor nthere is great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk with each other making funny wisecracks and oneliners but not in any kind of distracting manner nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get typical fight scene the case is far from solved nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we do nt realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together nmaybe the finally scene is bit much but it still has believable atmosphere to it nwere so relieved when justice is served nits not the plot is that makes the fugitive great its all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story nwatching seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this see also nick of time

bever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan nyou remember he was the title character in that sitcom welcome back kotter nalways trying to help out the sweathogs frequently trying to dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole so you ask where is he now nmr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional highstakes poker nthats right nim not sure if its his main source of income but from what ve heard the guy occasionally comes away with at time nand there you were thinking was going to tell you he was doing offbroadway theater nyou silly goose nwell gabe kaplan is nt in the movie rounders nor is the film about the actor come gamblers life nbut rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and thought that was kind of neat connection nsorry about the segue or lack thereof nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott law student who also has singular talent for the game of poker nhes been playing for while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how to win nin the beginning of the film he built up nice thirty grand nest egg which he takes to the speakeasytype gaming parlor where the big boys play nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreomunching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia nmike has the potential to take large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in single hand nmonths later he paying his way through law school by driving delivery truck nwhen mikes best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants to pick up right were they left off working as team to part others with their betting cash nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life nto make film about gambling filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters nthis is because few moviegoers will care whole lot about some guy in leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at folding card table with stogie in his mouth nrounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent are nt very glamorous at all ntheres basement lodge with elk heads on the wall goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it nwere given nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them nmatt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ned nortons worm is truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth njohn turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments nhes both friend and mentor to mike and turturros lowkey performance is totally convincing just as john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors abe petrovsky nwhile landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to ones self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward predictable ending nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just did nt seem to have much presence on screen nshes genuine peach to look at kind of cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and would nt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead na good thing about rounders is that it does nt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it ca nt find time for humor nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales none game in cigar club had me in stitches love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys nwith all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing nyou might think you know lot about poker but think again nluckily were given narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what going on nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do nits nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world nas film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades nwait nas film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace nhang on npacked with great acting and great characters rounders is full house nokay guess that enough noh by the way if you ever want to get into game with ol gabe kaplan be sure to bring note from epsteins mother

bi wish could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there is nt ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again nthis is the first star wars film ve seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when watched the three original episodes on video nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals nbasically the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets nquigon liam neeson and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jarjar binks to fix the mess that may result in war nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother nquigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing nanakin participates in heartpounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship nhowever most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy nmeanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wits end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of crumb nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made nin all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes ndespite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws nfor starters we have the illconceived moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience nwhat klutz ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda rd or cpo but alas his efforts were in vain nsecondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments nthis is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions ni ca nt say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway nhowever there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale nnatalie portman has great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen stoic unfeeling enigma nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk ndespite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences does nt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite nthe film is treasure to look at nthe visual effects are astonishing of the time the aweinspiring mouthopening eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius nnot since the fifth element has there been film as drenched in visual treats as this one nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubricks maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis nhowever all the sets are so original nthe original star wars movies ca nt even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode nthe costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them nwhether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie nas for john williams score do nt think he done one as complex or powerful since ca nt even remember nit is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed nthere is very little to hate in the film its very accomplished and skillfully made flick nit is the best fun film and the best bigbudget film out today most definitely
bi came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy nits not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless ni sat there watching this marshmallow of movie unfold when suddenly realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa nin word its the same thing that wrong with so many movies circa writing nmore to the point its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you re telling story about relationship nthe bachelor is merely the latest in long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because they re attractive and pleasant nin this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit is jimmy shannon chris odonnell single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage nits scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years nconvinced despite his reservations that its time to sh or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly nanne refuses which leaves jimmy in very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves very specific video will njimmy stands to inhereit million if he is married by on his th birthday stays married for years and produces child nthere are only couple of minor problems jimmys th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends nits wacky brewsters millionsesque premise acknowledged as such in one of the films better more selfaware lines of dialogue the kind where shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters nat least that would be the case if jimmy were nt already worldclass altruist nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy does nt get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs nfrom the outset jimmys motivation is nt cash its the livelihoods of his devoted employees nits almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play role in the bachelors plot development nby any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless nand that the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness ntheres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers because there no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake nthe blandly nice odonnell could nt pull off randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers do nt even let him zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation nthe parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny since they re all that stands between us and blissfully sweet foregone conclusion nill admit couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinovs rantings about procreation and restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in church nyoure never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from film like the bachelor but that not the real problem nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to nthe problem are beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy there no spark no energy no humanity nits an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions nweve reached point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment do nt even have pulse nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins
bif you re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland you re going to love the hunt for red october nyoull also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if you re sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernans earlier films die hard and predator nin fact the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them nthe hunt for red october is an epic thriller adapted from tom clancys best selling novel nset in an era before glasnost the movie revolves around topsecret soviet submarine called the red october nthe nuclear sub has revolutionary propulsion system which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection nthe red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius played by sean connery nramius has strict orders just to test the submarine but he has other ideas nhe takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean nis he planning to start world war iii ncia analyst jack ryan does nt think so he convinced that ramius plans to defect to the ryan played by alec baldwin is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub nthe characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin but the performances thankfully are rock solid nbaldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor nsam neil gives sturdy performance as connerys somber first officer nits ironic to see neil and connery playing russians since they are both best known for their roles as british agents connery as james bond and neil as reilly ace of spies nthe large cast also includes scott glenn james earl jones tim curry and joss ackland plus richard jordan as the smooth national security adviser nthe special effects are remarkable but more than anything the hunt for red october is distinguished by its watertight plot nscreenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through story line full of twists and turns nthey keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment nthe movie does nt get as sweaty or breathless as die hard because it would rather tell good story than hit you over the head with nonstop action nthe finale is rousing and suspenseful but essentially the hunt for red october is superior potboiler
bin roger michells romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title none day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase book on turkey nquickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat nthe film opens with nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such nwithout words this sequence gives us background to her character nfollowing however is setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives ni do nt know why the filmmakers chose to go with narration which tells us nothing we could nt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning but there it is nif there were ever clear case for less is more this would be it nthe film is told nearly first person from williams point of view as he is in every scene nby nature of this arrangement we get very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily nin fact much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he even talking to silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image nwilliam assures her he would nt say word then adds well ill probably tell myself now and then but never believe it ngreat stuff nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we do nt get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible nwere constantly exposed to williams thoughts feelings actions and desires but do nt actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him nthere are couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what she been thinking all the times in between nthis combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grants film hands down nhe gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior nanna does nt get lot of our compassion nthis romantic comedy leans little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike williams eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh nhugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family particularly shining in scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of movie star in their midst nits scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with similar situation nroger michells use of visuals does nt sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type nfor example there are couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass nwhereas some films are content to simply put in caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him nanother memorable shot occurs in park where the camera is lifted from ground level to couple of hundred feet in the air nwere generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have birds eye view of the ground below nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect nits kind of mixed bag but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate nnotting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it nfor couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and that not so bad now is it

bnosferatu the vampyre germany na film review by mike watson copyright mike watson nthis extraordinary retelling of bram stokers dracula by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore ninspired by murnaus silent film of the same name herzogs film is work of exquisite bleakness an oddly touching tragedy with beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards nthe original fulllength english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received video release by distributor anchor bay entertainment and in gorgeous widescreen prints nuntil now only shortened english language version of the film was available on video and only in europe nboth of these rereleases restore the film to its full length but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue napparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed nthe german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one neveryone knows the story of dracula nor do they nhis story has been so bastardised on film over the years that brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wo nt hurt njonathan harker is young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with creepy count played by klaus kinski who wants to buy house in harkers hometown nupon seeing photo of harkers wife the radiant isabelle adjani he instantly falls in love with her nlocking harker up in his castle he sets off on long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him nupon divining his identity as vampire adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises nthat is story familiar to millions but herzog has elevated stokers tale into the realm of and use this term tad reluctantly cinematic art nnosferatu is as much meditation as it is film shot through blueish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised nthe films surreal dreamlike quality is utterly mesmerising nthere is much to enjoy but ill limit my praise to few key points nholding the film together is kinskis remarkable performance as count dracula npast screen portrayals including bela lugosis famous turn have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp nbut kinski oh boy this is something far more compelling naided by startling makeup job he portrays draculas vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease nthis man is dreadfully lonely nhe lives in utter solitude shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust nkinskis portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting nwhen he dies you almost feel as if this mans tortured soul has been freed at last nthen there the unforgettable soundtrack largely composed by german group popul vuh nit is so eerily beautiful and evocative that its quite impossible to imagine the film without it npopul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancientsounding kind of spacemusic using piano chants and exotic instruments nwhen first saw this film some years ago was so impressed tracked down and bought number of their albums nthe one still listen to the most is tantric songs from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken nits testament to the musics depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them nthe album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies nthis is timely rerelease by anchor bay nafter francis ford coppolas unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stokers tale in it is joy to go back to herzogs film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now centuryold story nto some aficionados nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made nwithout doubt it is an unmistakable classic of the genre ndont miss it
bits been good long while since we had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but its been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly nid saw that its been at least couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though hardly comparing simple plan to say rear window or strangers on train nyet its almost as good nits simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral nelegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of crashed plane and within bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dimwitted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe nwithout anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally do nt flaunt anything they do nt want to flaunt they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or they could fight amongst themselves simple plan though borrows little from each of these na little tiff with the cops here subplot involving an alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit of inside feuding over here nbut as austin powers would say that not necessarily its bag baby nwhat most admired about this film and what makes this far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in black duffle bag nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity nin one early scene paxton and thornton have to make trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it does nt look like it was all stolen not bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major coveringup read homicide ninstead of quick murder and immeadiate handswashing raimi shows lengthy painful shot from lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach conclusion ntheres similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gutwrenching nin short probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done nbut the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof nyet it also moves from step to step in such graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights ntheres at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they do nt come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror nduring the one was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they ca nt do this can they nstreeming through my head nin fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be overthetop distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then nagain after seeing the evil dead films hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments rifleshot notwithstanding ninstead raimi directs with maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and characters coexist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches nmost particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob is brilliant creation nhis dimwittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but there authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that were not totally laughing at him nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of fullcondescension because thornton is so damn real njacobs multidimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much flaw but strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and coconspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money nthe final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book by the way are just great ni particularly admired back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to nearsweetness and further strength of his saddened character nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance he ever given and further proof that he the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you do nt believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this had nt been in the same year because he easily able to slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable nhe brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors its difficult picturing anyone else in the role nthe rest of the cast is great too from paxtons declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff neven fonda shows off her talents nicely nand if had any complaints about the film its that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved nand the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when you re trying to set things up andor express emotions did nt raimi watch the first murder scene nand the thing that can most usually go wrong with movie the ending is basically amiss ni wo nt reveal it but its way too cruel and too much of an outsider setup as if the appearance of plane was nt already too much of that anyway nfor film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending nimagine charactercontrolled ending otherwise its like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that at all comparing simple plan to dostoevsky nthe ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day nbut despite my mere claims make no mistake that was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
bfirst am not big fan of the xfiles tv series ni have nothing against it particularly just do nt happen to watch it nhaving said that can now say that liked the xfiles pretty well nfor us nonfans there nothing big going for it but there are lot of little things nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in ntwo protohumans enter the cave and find space alien cocooned inside nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where boy lucas black from sling blade is captured by the same black ooze nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder gillian anderson and david duchovny who have been pulled off of their previous assignment investigations into the paranormal and put onto the bomb squad detail na caller has threatened federal building in dallas texas non hunch mulder checks out the building across the street and would nt you know it he turns out to be right nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse nfive people die in the blast and when mulder learns who the victims were light bulb goes on over his head nthe two agents team up to investigate against fbi orders the links mulder has made ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave all across the country and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to the truth nthe plot and the truth are uninspired ni got the feeling that what learned was supposed to shock and amaze me nit did nt nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them nbut the point of the xfiles is not what the truth is but the extent to which it has been hidden nits slightly more interesting angle but it still raises expectations about that truth too high nif this were the whole film would say the movie was mediocre perhaps even boring nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest nbefore the audience can get tired of one location the agents follow hot tip to another location and so on and so forth nthe locations are not all computergenerated sets either nthere are some artificial settings but the desert night of nevada the edge of suburbia in texas and the endless fields of snow in antarctica actually somewhere in north america nmake this fantastic film feel more real nward russells cinematography is very good nthe overall look is dark and ominous appropriate to the intended tone of the films plot nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as cornfield look foreboding nwhen the movie is set in darkness the picture quality is still rich and detailed nfinally and specifically there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of fast oncoming train ni do nt know if the shot is faked in any way but it looks dangerous and it looks great nthe movies soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film skip nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie there is spoiler in the following sentences during the opening prehistoric sequence howling wind dogs the soundtrack never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound nin one of the movies most effective sequences metallic doors suddenly slam open to release cloud of buzzing bees nthe visuals of the scene are good but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound nthere was no question as to who the movies stars would be neven so duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and good combination nboth are easy on the eyes and together they have some good timing banter and energy nthere is hint of chemistry between them but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship nthey are like couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street nthere might be some romantic interest but for now they re more interested in their environs than they are in each other nno single element really makes this movie outstanding not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular nbut enough things were done right that the xfiles is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along
bunzipped is cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric nostensibly the film is documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning nmany scenes appear staged and great deal of cuttingandpasting has been done in the editing room nthe cinema verite effect is conceit genuine spontaneity is at premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially wouldbe actresses like cindy crawford ndirector douglas keeve who was mizrahis lover at the time freely admits that he could nt care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion ndespite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment nwhile it sheds only little light on the behindthescenes world of the fashion industry it presents fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he funny energetic and eminently quotable nhe has unusual views on just about everything from fashion its about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs nunzipped also gives glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into dress nits almost certainly different that anyone would imagine nthe designer draws on variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of ouija board to help form the collection nin particular unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista non the technical side number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped na variety of film stocks were used super mm blackandwhite and mm color nthere is purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audiences perspective while blackandwhite is for the behindthe scenes sequences nnevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment nwhile unzipped is nt an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear noverall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed nwhen the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed
blucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode episode is boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects nafter the familiar long time ago nopening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate deal with the confederation to stop the blockade nhowever this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park nthey also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd nstar wars is largely failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into two hour epic nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent ntheres no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is nthe film also takes leisurely pace in telling the boring story which does nt help ntheres no snap to make the film work it moves at plod nthe script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother ntheres no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders its evident that not much is going to happen nthe two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it nquigon and obiwan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy nanakin is annoying and unlikeable ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended nits probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by pod racer because knew he would nt be able to talk for while nqueen amidala is nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go googoo over anakin nagain her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here nthe actors do nt help the movie much either nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible nmcgregor comes across as posh mothers boy with little charm nthe casting director must have chose him because he scottish like alec guinness there little other explanation for it nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and poor script but she delivers spunky performance nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in bored voice ntheres very little talent evident with him its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there nhes not even very cute nthe main claim of the film the special effects are okay ntheres nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well nthe cgi takes away much of the human element however nthe battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers nepisode is just disappointing nits got high production values but little else nthe music is meandering except near the end nthe plot gives us noone to root for or even care for nthe effects are nice but dull nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should ntheres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich are catered for throughout the film napart from remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film ndisappointing is barely the word nrating
bthe jekyll and hyde story told from his maids point of view is in word dark nyou would nt expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevensons novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal njekyllhyde john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate nmary reilly julia roberts is victim of monstrous child abuse and the antiwoman sentiment of the times ndirector stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them nthe lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears to be filmed in black and white nthe direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid nscenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off strawberry except there no red of course nthe look is so moody and melodramatic that you ll be shocked when you leave the theater ni saw it at matinee and took quite while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward noften the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts nhere the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless nhis alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience ntwo parts that make up whole nneither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable nthe differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude nwhen we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands nroberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles nboth are suitably melancholy fitting in with the rest of the film nthe only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents nlife and color maybe but this is not closes best role nshe seems little more than cardboard cutout character na beautiful film in its own dreary way nyoull appreciate the filmmaking craft but do nt expect to leave in an upbeat mood
bforget get carter ninstead nget me cup of coffee nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ndid unknowingly miss meeting somewhere nwhen did all of the badass kicking butt and taking names guntoting crazed vengeful characters of the from such films as commando cobra predator raw deal first blood suddenly turn into innocent compassionate sensitive tearyeyed knuckleheads nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east and do nt mean new york city nget carter the latest masterpiece from uberthespian sylvester stallone is prime example of large and in charge action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up na few years ago stallone made movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland strange film about redemption within broken soul nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges nget carter is simple story nstallone plays frank carter vegas bruiser for loan shark played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore nwhen franks brother gets himself killed in drunk driving accident frank feeling all guilty and mushy inside thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented carters way nhe talks tough with his brothers wife lends helping had to his brothers daughter doreen rachel leigh cook and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like lost member of the rat pack with really bad goatee ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with slimy porn king played by ultracool mcqueenesque mickey rourke multimillionaire computer geek alan cumming and strange foreign guy michael caine who speaks in riddles and talks tough ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties nwhat minute nthis sounds just like another film saw last year the limey nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off nactually get carter is remake of the british production of the same name starring caine in the title role and what with his cameo here the cleverness is astonishing nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here the movie lacks what the original did as well purpose nthroughout the film stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough while nobody is taking him seriously nhis oneliners fall flat and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions mental and physical required of his character nthere is even strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends bizarre tone to their numerous conversations in both fists and words nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs spousal abuse boxing career and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way rourke still brings dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character nhe may not win any oscars but he still ranks highly in my book nget carter has great directing strong acting by rourke and caine and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud nthe only thing it lacks as with most hollywood productions is good script and proper casting nnever mind that it should never have been made at all

bhong kong cinema has been going through bad spell nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films nin nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership lot of hong kongs best talents have crossed the pacific to work on productions nsuch talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yunfat anna the king the corrupter and yuen wooping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai nunfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of typical hollywood action film and none of hong kongs rhythms nthe film opens in nightclub as an asian couple is necking nenter group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong nkai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kais boss and leader of the local chinese family na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down nits not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends nthe following morning po sing is found dead nsuspicions escalate as issac oday delroy lindo is told of the murder nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into legitimate venture nissac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter nthe scene shifts to prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined nhung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work nescaping to the han sets out to find the person responsible for his brothers death romeo must die is in many ways fun film nit is both absurd and assured nthe basic plot of gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather nthe relationship between jet lis han and aaliyahs trish oday reminds us of abel ferreras china girl except that romeo must dies couple never once exchange more than loving glance towards one another ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable nli of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination nallayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with certain style and grace nits obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic nbut still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it ndelro lindo as issac oday carries himself well in the film nan unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for woodside as issacs son colin nthe performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does workmanlike job in handling the film nhaving career as one of the industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to semblance of life during the fight scenes nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of sports center for nfl team is needlessly confusing nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayahs bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes njet li is master of these intricate physical battles none needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat nhere jet is given the opportunity to show off in way that lethal weapon jets debut did nt allow nunfortunately lot of jets fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision nalso romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent nobviously homage to the famed xray scene from sonny chibas streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film nits as if the film has stopped and video game has been inserted none problem though about the fight scenes nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon nthey do have an internal rhythm to them na heartbeat so to speak in their choreography nthe fight scenes in hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance nthis is created by the performance the direction and the editing nhere in romeo must die there is no staccato nevery fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern nthe rhythm is monotonous na hong kong film has tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact nrmd is limited to standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever na fine example of this difference can be found by examining couple of jackie chans films nwatch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help nnow look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx nthere you have heartbeat and emotional draw that does nt let the audience catch its breath nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted nhere in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl njet li is grand and personable screen presence nits shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here none day filmmakers here in the will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such commodity nuntil then well be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die
btheres moment in schindlers list when number of jews are trudging through snow clean and crisp dark edges and frost on the ground none girl waltzes through wearing red dress that stings the eyes nit is probably the finest moment through out the film nwhen first saw it began to cry though could not say why nthis landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole nwhen one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground so black and murky its almost pomegranate red nat another time we follow young boy as he runs searching for hiding spot before finally squeezing into toilet which is already occupied nlike so citizen kane fargo the godfather the godfather part ii greed many of the greatest american films schindlers list plays with the concepts of money power and soul nbut this is movie about man who does the right thing nstarkly emotional and brutally powerful schindlers list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings nthe following that it has gained is not suprising this is probably thus far the best film of the decade nsteven spielberg has always been skilfull filmmaker his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks jaws the indiana jones films and but it was nt until that we saw what brilliant man he can be nthe product of his genuis is really something to see it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you nthroughout we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads nwe watch oskar schindler liam neeson grow from an arrogant self important man who hires jews only to save money into moving figure with deep sense of pride and accomplishment nthe film requires much work and can be harrowing experience go expecting quick entertainment and you ll be bitterly dissapointed nit does reward the patient viewer nthis is mature spielberg and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece nthis eqsuisite beautiful film is rare gem nit does good job of summarizing why love movies nit leaves one breathless uplifted and with much to think about nafterwards you can reflect on individual images visions and people nlaconic removed schindler strides through the film detached prescence who watches all does much and leaves feeling as if he could should have done more then he did and was able to nthe change seems natural in the hands of lesser filmmaker it would be crude and would cheat the audience ninstead we are told tale told story nthe film is punishing to watch yes nbut anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience miracle and genuine masterpiece of movie
bit seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality nits exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh njim carreys signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth nsuch protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just could nt take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie is nt funny nits not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them nthis of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy is nt above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks nsome have suggested that this is nt problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor does nt require plot to work ntheyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort there something about mary outside providence was technically an earlier project nthe brothers earlier film was nt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleightofhand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes nbut they have nt come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the getgo think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you have nt already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it has nt been elevated to another funnier level and it has nt been dropped either nthats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions nthis does nt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they do nt have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script does nt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nits great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey does nt pull any stunts we do nt expect him to pull and the farrellys script does nt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting are nt set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellwegers irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut do nt believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart

bif there one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively its obvious there no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater nso when movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in blanket of innovative ideas and served up on platter of fine production its welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for nothought movie nquite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen nthe story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema nnot in recent memory has movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still testament that his picture was considered worthy enough nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite bit of luck find themselves zapped into fifties sitcom named pleasantville nmaguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times nits not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in quite unlikely way what life is really like nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness nat one end is soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is closeminded mayor nwalsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town nfine performances are turned in all around nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and nwalsh in his latest and final posthumous performance ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy nfor daniels its his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh its complementary exclamation point on fine career nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish ntheres not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who do nt

bits terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to psychological drama nadditionally while the sixth sense had shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist nand where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary ni have feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits nadapted from novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with cute sixyearold boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking bath nhe is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have feeling someone else is there nfinally he asks does it hurt to be dead napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child is nt the focus of the picture ninstead tom witzy kevin bacon chicago lineman is our protagonist njake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hardworking wife none night while at party with their closest friends tom convinces maggies newage sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him nit unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he would nt normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months nseeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door nshe did nt expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes is nt perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama and is not only effective on technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of struggling workingclass family nkevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe dream with the fishes are topnotch and exceedingly believable as loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet nin masterfullydone entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching movie screen from inside theater which is also showing movie screen in theater ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep nnever before have seen hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one ntruthfully this setpiece and another in which tom wakes up from nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggies sister lisa illeana douglas to die for her last great character is delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films nfunny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about toms visions of the girl she remarks would nt be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she dead gives one pause nalso of note are jenny morrison intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in whatever as morrisons grieving teenage sister debbie nif the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it does nt what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty nthe music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is director with knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters stir of echoes is nt as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is spinetinglingly good horror film
bwith storytelling this compelling who needs books nbased on the book by author james ellroy confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years ntogether with director curtis hanson the hand that rocks the cradle the river wild whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film resulted in movie with plot and and script so tight an atom would have to squeeze itself through nset in the the story revolves around policemen of vivid personalities njack vincennes spacey is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention nthere is also the young hotshot rookie ed exley pearce fresh out of the academy and allout to carve name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father nthe tough and unnerving bud white crowe cop who believes in justice the swift and violent way policemen distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in place where there is no real distinction between good and evil nwhen his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just simple robbery murder neven after exley receives promotion for his work on the murder case happenings began to link itself to the murder nthe eventually reach point of convergence when what actually began as personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of complex web of organisedcrime in hollywood nthe last time remember film so clever and compelling was when watched the usual suspects nin confidential you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has lot more of story going for it nthere is not single moment in the film in which felt was slow at all nsurprisingly though spacey did very convincing job as the streetwise vincennes the movie was carried mostly by the two rather unknowns pearce and crowe npearces exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance ncrowes bud white is the most impressive of all headstrong and temperamental he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here nsuperb acting wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever neasily the best hollywood piece for
bjohn von neumann progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project pointed out long ago that there is great way to explore the cosmos even without recourse to fasterthan light travel nyou send out selfreplicating robot ships which explore and radio back information nit may take decades centuries or millennia but it can be done with achievable technology and does nt require magical fasterthanlight drive nin the fifties british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for complex computer and program for it any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer which would then engage in realtime dialog with the aliens exchanging information and technologies and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned nabout thirtyfive years ago the bbc contracted with astronomerwriter fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for miniseries called for andromeda nafa concerned the reception of hoyle transmission the construction of huge computer the computers analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the thenunknown julie christie naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for sequel andromeda breakthrough which played to equally high ratings ndennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent wellstructured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into morass of chase and action mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl nfeldman writes good scenes but has no idea how to tell story or write movie even with previous version to use as model nnow in species we have mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed by preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases nspecies features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in badlywritten portrayal of feebly amoral scientist nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script nthe species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the we really did nt know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in position to radio out set of blueprints for human beings neven today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not copy of human dna because we do nt have it analyzed yet nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms nthe first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multiform existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be nher instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her nshe goes on an eating binge spins herself cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in nthe pursuers michael madsen is an assassinexterminator forrest whitaker is convenient empathpsychic just as though the government actually had such people on call nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided nwhitakers role seems to be aimed at making whitaker male copy of star trek the next generations counselor cleavage nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was bit weak nh gigers design for the main form of the alien creature is actually bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly nthe main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then does nt live up to it nall we get are chase scenes and few nice sex scenes with few monsters tossed in nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just sequence of scare scenes stuck together nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them non the other hand as an exercise in scifi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large its fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing nmy personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you do nt enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters nmpaa classification

deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by squidlike menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last springs anaconda deep rising has no tongue to put in its cheek nfolks were only month into the new year and already heres candidate for one of its stinkiest releases nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uhoh if these people had seen titanic then maybe they have known to stay home when its attacked by giant tentacled sea creature nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and few other crew members na mercenary team lead by resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something bloodsoaked hungry and not very helpful nthe main problem with deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most scifihorror films in recent memory nthe concept is leviathan meets titanic with dash of speed thrown in for good or is that bad nmeasure nthis monster is equal parts leagues under the sea and the relic knows how to open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets to expel halfdigested victim neat effect admittedly la the giant snake in anaconda nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of alien resurrection ntheres even jet ski chase like hard rain nand the list goes on nwatching deep rising cast battle the beast is murky chore in itself because none of them have welldeveloped characters nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy nwilliams is affable enough but his finnegan just is nt believable nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye killer thighs is trapped in forced romantic interest with williams while kevin oconnor as finnegans mechanic provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast ndjimon honsou who received raves for his performance as noble slave in decembers amistad pops up in brief part nhe needs to stay away from the water nthe movies final shot is groaner as is the thhour regurgitation of subplot involving an onship saboteur nas if cast deserving of their snack foodfate is nt bad enough when you taunt the monster you re really asking for it deep rising is slow stupid slog through story without single bright spot nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are to the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship is nt out of the question
bits ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directors cut of the film nfilms such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator are all prime examples of filmmakers integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio nthe advent of the dvd format has provided more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films nthe dvd release of the original international version of luc bessons masterpiece the professional which is known as on around the world is prime example of how good film can become an instant classic as directors cut nfor years have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format which has eluded me for years ni even bought laserdisc player from my uncle don for bucks just to watch certain directors cuts including on nbut after countless searches in laserdisc stores could never find it nuntil now nthe film follows the story of on played by jean reno professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello nhe lives next door to ferociously independent yearold girl named mathilda played by then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops none day crew of the cops lead by gary oldman in an overthetop performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries ntaking pity on her on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life nmathilda learns of ons hit man profession and decides to follow in ons footsteps as cleaner nshe then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within on he has kept locked away as part of his profession nat this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in nthe international version contains an additional minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit ni assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle nthe best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathildas and ons motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops ntheres even previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jeanhugues anglade star of queen margot bessons la femme nikita and killing zoe nwith these additional scenes replaced on and matildas relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version nthe most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes the film becomes primarily heavy emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film nthe film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema nmy advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece ndirectorwriter luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello

bi like movies with albert brooks and really like movies directed and written by albert brooks nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies nhis humor is of kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we ca nt brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably wo nt find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will nput simply brooks comedy is intelligent nmother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint nbrooks plays john henderson middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce nhe makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life njeff has good job loving family and most of all warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds nafter dinner john witnesses telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is nin comparison beatrice always hints at fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life she says love you and john replies with know you think you do nthe thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading nits the kind that goes something like yes dear think you do that wonderfully but nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy ntheres always the big but njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is great experiment he calls it nbrooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother ntheres scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you do nt want to stay at hotel nshe still does nt get it and it is absolutely hilarious nin the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice nasks john nhes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as twentypound block of cheese the freezer was good invention says john but its not supposed to be used for everything nthats why its smaller than the refrigerator nits something most of us find strangely familiar nbrooks is also master at employing the non sequitur nfor example in defending your life his and meryl streeps characters are in comedy club having discussion nwhen they re finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside nyou do nt know what the joke was because you could nt hear him during the entire scene but must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context nin this film brooks uses the same trick couple of times to open or close scene ni do nt want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past njohns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way non screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world nin way he very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect nshe assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking little slowly and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her nas his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease nthat may be just as well since reynolds lends softness to the character which enhances it immensely nrob morrow also does good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as mamas boy nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are couple of plot holes na solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother nadditionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this nbeatrice you must think some kind of moron njohn no think your someone who thinks moron nbeatrice well it takes one to know one
bbilly bob thornton who had sudden rise to fame with sling blade after spending years as virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment nas jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxtons hank thornton gives performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers nthree men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields rotting corpse and bag full of money njacob and lou want to pocket the cash nhank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find neventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways nthings start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan ndisaster is sure to strike ndirector sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thoughtprovoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name nwhile there are couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be sign of even greater films to come nscott smiths screenplay based on his novel which have nt read is fine example of escalating tension nwhile it does remind one of danny boyles shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be part of such story on morality or the lack thereof found in film with this subject matter nalar kivilos cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coens fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character ndanny elfman also does well with his moody finelywritten score nif there flaw in the film its that it goes on for just little too long njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on little further nwhile this is nt really bad thing it did become little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that had consumed large sprite beforehand nthe performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving scenestealing turn as hanks scheming wife nthis is an excellent showcase for thorntons fine skills as an actor and great change in direction for raimi who could very well have career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films nfingers crossed though that this does nt stop him from making another evil dead sequel
bas with any genx mtv movie like last years dead man on campus the movie is marketed for primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points sex and football nthose two items wrapped in guiltypleasure package are sure to snare sizeable box office chunk initially but sales will decline for two reasons nfirst the football sequences are nothing new nor can they be the sports genre is nt mainstream and its been retread to death nsecond the sex is just bad ndespite the appearance of whipped cream bikini or the allnight stripclub party there nothing even remotely tantalizing nthe acting is mostly mediocre not including the fantastic jon voight ncultivating his usual sliminess voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twentytwo conference championships and two state titles in thirty years this year he plans to make it twentythree nunfortunately when his star quarterback lance harbor paul walker goes down for the count he got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon james van der beek nmoxon leads the team through its last four games and then must cope with his newfound stardom the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie amy smart and other temptations that abound in footballcrazy west canaan nmost regions of the country are not nearly as footballcrazy as texas and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most nsimilarly the set design is wrong for high school setting the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms radio headsets which never seem to work however and instead require coaches to signal plays manually and even giant bronze statue of coach kilmer nthese elements as well as the heavy drinking and carousing might be more appropriate on college campus but mtvs core audience is the high school demographic nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting james van der beek of tvs dawsons creek is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero although he never manages to do anything with the role nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable ntheres not much that goes right about varsity blues and there not much to like about it either neverything herein has already been done and if it has nt the movie manages to botch it one way or another nthis is certainly missable
byoung einstein is embarrassingly lame but that did nt stop it from becoming phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time nin the warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under npersonally hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein box office bomb nyoung einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts nhis creation is about as stupid and contrived as you expect from someone named yahoo nthe movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth nwhereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania remote australian island nin addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar nyahoo plays einstein as naive and unrefined country hicka clown with an insatiable curiosity nalthough yahoos performance is at first endearing the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc nyahoo has created charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever nbut after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into poor excuse for comedy nyoung einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot nyahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing nalmost every other scene includes blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching movie or music video nthe instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect nhalfway through young einstein knew for sure the movie was stinker nbut it was nt until the very end that finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy primetime sitcoms nin fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor would nt raise any eyebrows

bheres something to chew on what the favorite food of big cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of luxury liner in deep rising nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard because that the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by computer nin fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas perhaps it was nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and nonhuman been scattered in all directions nwe learn some bloody trivia as well such as how sea monster spraypaints in red it drinks human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does with halfdigested leftovers ni suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it does nt do much for me non the surface and that about the only level at which this film can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection since james cameron directed both nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks by wide margin nthe film is not humorous tense or exciting nin fact its downright boring and despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ deep rising feels like the longer movie nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot nprobably not since its easy to guess but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants synopsis nthe film opens by introducing us to gang of bad guys on board mercenary ship nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics there finnegan treat williams the boats pilot who supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin oconnor the inept sidekick who supposed to be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and use that term lightly of the operation ntheir goal attack cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes nthe problem is by the time they reach the argonautica the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste naside from beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and couple of crew members there no one on board nthe reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over by bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles nthe cast which is led by treat williams is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistads cinque nwilliams once ca nt miss prospect in hollywood has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for lead role is film like deep rising and his inability to create charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career nfamke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams ngiven her limited acting abilities its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes nunfortunately bra defeats the purpose of having her in wet teeshirt for half of the picture nmeanwhile kevin oconnor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching blackboard nthese days audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects nthis is lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book needs to learn nthe days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past nnow moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where reality begins nin deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing nunfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here is nt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although to be fair deep rising is particularly bad entry neven once this film has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it wo nt be the last of its kind nlike the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush nand that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying

it either nfor all intents and purposes it is bad movie though bad in really good sort of way but sumptuous production design and great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film nby the time the credits role it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on nwhen say that the walltowall songs are catchy what really mean to say is that once you hear them they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity nit goes without saying that the time warp is the most popular song in the film neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song nwhat those who have nt seen the movie do nt know though is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment nmy personal favorite is over at the frankenstein place but dammit janet is also maddeningly catchy ntim currys vocals on the rocking tune sweet transvestite need to be heard to be believed nthe finale of the film big floor show staged by franknfurter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets including barry bostwick nfrightening features no less than four songs rose tint my world do nt dream it wild and untamed thing and going home all of which are immensely singable nthe films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though ndespite the catchiness of the songs this movie would have been long forgotten about if it had nt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be part of their own little floor show nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in theater with hundreds of rabid fans unless you do nt mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place nnote director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film in the form of sequel resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment which picks up with brad and janet this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper as contestants on game show in their home town of denton nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager also played by de young who wishes to claim janet as his own nobrien returned as writerperformer on the project as did quinn campbell and gray in performance capacity only but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original years later this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world nas lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans brand new special edition disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its th anniversary nif you are one of those people who ca nt get enough of the film this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film fox home entertainment has released this wonderful disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it ll take good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of enhanced for televisions nthe film is presented in two different versions the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds musical number during the finale called superheroes nfor ambitious viewers the disc also includes hidden version located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting pair of lips in the lower left corner which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen noriginally the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz with the first half of the it seen in black and white and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number nmost reports including documentary on the disc say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced nthe film contains commentary track by show creator and faithful handyman richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore and there are quite few nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in theater with several audience participation segments nthe first feature and the most simple is subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is nthe second feature is an audience participation track which lets you in on what you might hear on good night out at the show nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just large group of people screaming their heads off but every once and while comment can be heard that will invoke bit of laughter nthe final participation segment uses technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd where pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film mostly during the musical numbers that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote nwhen selected you will be taken out of the film and into live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world nonce the segment is over you are deposited right back into the film where you left off nthe first disc also contains few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player nthere is timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation video jukebox you do nt know jackstyled trivia game which is about as bare bones you do nt know jack parody as it can be and bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras nformer literock video channel turned music historians vh have allowed some of their outtake footage from the behind the music rocky horror special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here as well as popup video for the meat loafsung hot patootie nthe behind the music segments are all very interesting especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle which is now hotel where the film was originally shot nthere are also extensions of the sarandon bostwick quinn obrien and meat loaf interviews nas far as extras for the film itself go there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here none of which is just the superheroes number available in the uk version but there is also another rare musical number presented here called once in while na series of alternate takes are also presented here but none of them are really much of revelation except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here nrounding out the disc is decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show two theatrical trailers proclaiming that the film is different sort of jaws still gallery and two singalongs for toucha toucha touch me and sweet transvestite nfoxs special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives you re lucky nim lucky nhes lucky nwere all lucky nits not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss fight club independence day and the sound of music fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want ni raise toast to them cue the throwing of the bread as cut out the lights sit back and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about bmovie tradition nr
bto me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in martin scorsese film ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains gifted and versatile screen presence never since the big success of the actionthriller faceoff in the hollywood road has been rocky one for mr cage nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of worst films nmm was disappointing lost cause nbut who better than scorsese to match cages wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from daytoday nafter five years of the stressinducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york nfrank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ill fire you tomorrow he promises nfrank is accompanied by fresh face every night in the ambulance nthe first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain nthe second is marcus ving rhames deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into regular rescue operation nand finally tom tom sizemore is deranged sociopath hungry for blood ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot neach is merely colorful presence to help develop franks character because bringing out the dead is predominantly study of his mind and detailed personality nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of newly admitted patient who suffered from severe heart attack narquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around reallife husband cage nits unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during mishandled ineffective finale nthe movie belongs to the onetwo punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hardedge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages to hit nerve with his latest picture nthe incredible camerawork and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of departure with kundun ndoes bringing out the dead rival scorseses finest work nonly occasionally nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in its interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice nthose expecting grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straightarrow approach but its still solid admirable effort nbringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull nschraders script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay nthe exceptional aspects of the film are its astounding technical credits and the amazing cast ngoodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but its the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves second look nwatch the actors deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects gothic band member and you ll understand why he won golden globe nbringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask its certain flaws nscorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned namong my fanatical ticker tapeworshipping friends there one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofskys darkly original pi the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but series of patterns which through analysis will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour an example of the mentality involved if the stock price goes up like this and then down like that and then sharply up this way it then will go this way nwhile freely admit that know less than nothing about the market knowledge check prices up good prices down bad most of the time at least and hence really could nt comment with any authority its always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system and besides if it were that simple no doubt somebody would ve already figured it all out nthe difference in this case is that while my colleague an otherwise assuredly realistic individual truly believes in this in and of itself as valid forecaster pi uses this ideology as device with which to investigate its characters psychosis nits also vastly more convincing with its argument mathematics is the language of the universe insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen sean gullette in cool mantralike voiceover which repeats throughout the picture nsince nature can be expressed in numbers and there are patterns everywhere in nature he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything the ups and downs of the stock market how many games the yankees will win this year the flavour of jam going to put on my toast tomorrow morning nobsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe max lives in paranoid selfimposed solitude in seedy nyc chinatown apartment singlemindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system nsullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines the elusive pursuit of mysterious digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness nthe story then is basically an eccentricity but its clever astute eccentricity perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism in an age where dominant societal phobia is ones individualism being replaced by series of numeric identifiers maxs allconsuming penchent for numbers at once creates lingering unsettling mood nit helps matters that he not particularly likable protagonist nall attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max spindly neuroticlooking individual who has nt the time to indulge in pleasantries nfor film which puts its lead character front and center mr gullette appears in virtually every scene pi takes refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics because of our ambivalence with max were not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with moment of epiphany as were following him through this plot with sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination its more disturbing journey than quest nstill we do care about maxs fate nteetering on the edge of dementia he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain both fronted by deliciously perky resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions nas we know in films where paranoia is dominant element see the truman shows laura linney character or for that matter in real life its always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary npi film that addresses patterns itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle headache scene important revelation or bit of plot development pillpopping montage hallucinatory nightmare with decidedly cronenbergesque undertones few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and bodythemed horror nosebleeding reality nthe repetitiveness far from being tedious is effectively maddening more than anything the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from maxs claustrophobic perspective nin this regard it wildly succeeds due to mr aronofskys striking direction nits rarity that film so completely immerses itself into protagonists warped perspective of his surrounding and high contrast blackandwhite cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme closeups lend heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings in some scenes the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr gullette make his character curiously resemble latterday max schreck from nosferatu nusing savage jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create sense of disorientation the picture is often dizzying to behold and maxs effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the socalled snorri cam which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts npis raw aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynchs early work in particular eraserhead nthe films sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by sly electronic score by clint mansell and gradually increases in intensity nstill amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood pi does occasionally display sense of humour nat one point marcy dawson pamela hart great fun entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure oneofakind ncomputer chip is nt it beautiful she coos na showcase for mr aronofskys technical virtuosity made for its since gone on to capture acclaim at the sundance film festival pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which ironically is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year
bsynopsis al simmons topnotch assasin with guilty conscience dies in fiery explosion and goes to hell nmaking pact with malebolgia chief demon there simmons returns to earth years later reborn as

intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max nthe early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing nwith the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros batman film franchise movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn nin the summer of hence new line cinema released spawn liveaction film based on the groundbreaking series nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark nwhat happened nwhy is spawn so bad ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in cameo ni do nt think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film ni place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blowout movies utilizing the latest computer technology nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics nhardly minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid do nt get me wrong but because the script and cast are nt engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath nspawns translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level nmcfarlanes spawn was tortured hero na mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless warm man in love with the beautiful wanda nhaving died and journeyed to hell he made pact to return to earth to be with wanda nsimmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married ndespite his sometimes violent nature readers could nt help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so nwhen the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote to supervirus called heat which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters nspawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman njohn leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him perfect candidate for the violator nthe film however spends so much time on the violators offensive antics that they grate on the nerves napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violators lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave nleguizamo does satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film nmichael jai white relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on nmore time needed to be spent on whites character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings na special note should be made about martin sheen as the overthetop obnoxious evil general wynn neasily the hammiest performance in the movie its hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now nsheens excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as mastermind villain and comes as surprise considering his extensive career in film nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down nmtvstyle jerky inyourface editing is one of them nflames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce shift in setting ncogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as poor narrator for the film nhe goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawns humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another nthe music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes nto be fair however marilyn mansons long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawns return to earth while filter and the crystal methods ca nt you trip like do proves surprisingly fitting theme song nfor as good comic book as it is spawn did not spawn good movie nspawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development nit receives two stars for its technically welldone special effects nmany other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better nrated pg spawn seems more violent than many rrated movies and probably would nt be appropriate for the very young

between the aristocracy and the slavessteerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular nok maybe that not enough parallels nso titanics not in gwtws league nno matter ntitanic is great movie in its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again nthe money was obviously wellspent nthe costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great ni especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks nbut writerdirectorproducer james camerons real challenge in writingdirecting producing titanic was nt just costuming and set design and special effects ncamerons major headache was keeping the audience interested in tale where everybody knows the ending going in nhe succeeds masterfully ncameron does two things that work incredibly well nfirst he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic that just titanic not the titanic mind you nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues yearold rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in nstuart does phenomenal job in brief role narrating the story of her experience to stunned paxton and his roughneck crew nsecondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio nthe way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an allstar cast so we see the impact of the disaster on wide group of people ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board nthe supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown there no moment when you stop and say oh yeah know him what he been in although would like to have seen colm meaney in white star uniform or even as the illfated engineer nthe love story itself is rather conventional ni think some reviewers found it weak and that may be fair criticism nthe performances are the key here nzane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt nhes smooth he looks great in tuxedo and he convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible nat the moment when he sees little girl too frightened to get aboard lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can save this little girl nbut can she help me get on lifeboat ndicaprio is revelation ni had nt seen him before in anything and did nt know what the heck to expect really honestly expected bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was bad idea so dicaprio plays poor american artist who wins ticket in poker game ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that its hard not to like him nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters nwinslets character grows up lot during the movie and so does her performance nat first she not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous nwe know from the narration that she monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there is nt any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio nwinslet and dicaprio develop chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg nits at that moment where winslets character really comes alive nfaced with real danger she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does splendid job nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cals fiery temper winslet turns in superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror nof course the most interesting character is the ship itself ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic and shows her in every mood as deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captains table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead ncamerons greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well
with all that education you should know what happiness is nstarring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsuehwei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nienchen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang huikung nevery country has eventually its new wave nfrance had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on nsome waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery ntaiwans new wave came in the in the work of directors like hou hsiaohsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beachyangs first featureis central nit created new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering nlater works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan distinctive international presence nthat day itself is long and frustrating the document of nations attempt to find voice nit does not lack ambition nit anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized whitecollar middleclass feel as their lives are shaped by oldfashioned rolesdedicated career men loyal housewivesthat they find unfulfilling njiali sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compassher husband her brother friends from her college daysas it charts her discontents nno one is happy njiali married her husband welei at young age nat the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jialis marriage seemed in comparison good one she chose welei of her own free will they loved each other nbut it goes wrong nthat day dutifully presents all the clich welei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with coworker jiali feels restless and trapped bound by choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise nthe film never redeems these clich by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured nit unfolds awkwardly as series of flashbacks told during luncheon in vienna where jiali meets her brothers old flame teresa hu now concert pianist whom she has not seen since college nboth women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness ntheir circumstances and those of jialis brother and college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choicesmarried the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate nit is not that jiali married the wrong man she did nt nthe problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy nfor woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins nthe films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan nseen now it does not seem provocative nindeed its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nnor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives forin young couples first kiss in the awkward meeting of woman and her husbands mistressbut they are brief ntoo often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenesgrocery shopping flowerarrangingin which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted nperhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating nbut jiali and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties nat two hours and fortyfive minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently longwinded nconsider the defining moment for jiali the titular day on the beach nthe thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from particular situation neven so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawnout narrative nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyleat least its his name in the creditswho is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong karwai he seems incapable of fashioning boring image nyou would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible nin scrutinizing the long decay of marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak

bdeserves recognition for making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety ncapsule review this is what feelgood family entertainment has morphed into in the an hourandahalf commercial disguised as an unnecessary remake in which the defining image is that of grown man launching volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass between this rocketman and george of the jungle disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include fart joke in film nas the absentminded professor who invents the titular computergenerated goop listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly nthe only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newlyfounded but firm belief that writerproducer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series ntake your kids to see boogie nights instead
btibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months kundun presence name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in with the search for the th incarnation of the tibetan leader na group of monks enters village and twoyearold child catches their attention nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine nhe and his family are then moved to monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in nthe peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india ncomparisons to seven years in tibet are inevitable nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt kundun features only native actors and is more of an insiders story nin some ways this makes this film superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audiencepleaser nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like wax dummy and moves as if he were computergenerated character non an intellectual level it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts nsome events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life is nt even mentioned here nglossed over in seven years the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about to change things after the chinese attack nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of sand mandala grain by grain nthe visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating poetic meditation for the audience nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from transcendental experience nmartin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears nsomething of thematic followup to his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest film yet noddly enough for director with history of graphic violence presenting history filled with atrocities by the chinese most of these events take place offscreen nhis decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in trance state is much more effective as mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations nphilip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting ni talked to tibetan met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india was struck by what was missing in the movie nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is distance between the audience and the movie nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings nwith the exception of few scenes involvement with the characters is slight none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as mischievous boy who ca nt resist being kid sometimes nan encounter with his older brother thubten norbu retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there are nt many of these neven with its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that fear most will miss nmany people who saw seven years in tibet will have been there done that attitude nits likely that the film will miss widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping
bsynopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins trip for four to the bahamas narriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they ve walked into trap set by the rainslickered slasher with huge hook for hand ncomments may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five ni am only vaguely aware of the shows premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials halfpaid attention to while watching the tube party of five do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre nneve campbell scream queen of the and star of scream scream and the craft is regular of the show nso too is jennifer love hewitt nlo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has horror franchise of her own the know what you did last summer line nthough the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout njennifer love hewitt is very goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting nshe just is nt convincing in this film and she was nt in the original either nthis puts many young males including myself in paradoxical quandary she very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girltype character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience nive spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for reason ni still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as vehicle for these two young actresses nnothing else here is original or interesting nthis movie in fact makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of bluelighted darkness scenes garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture nthe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killers hook nthey may as well have huge targets painted on them nlike scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief nunfortunately still knows characters are nt all that funny nin particular one character chainweedsmoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly does nt die soon enough nthe death scenes by the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror film nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie nthis too did not help the supposed humor still know was shooting for nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ni know that the slasher film is not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror ncome on the guy looks like the gortons fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like disney pirate nthough his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and that really saying something nso all that left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy nboth prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do nude scene nhewitt however does do postshower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite titillating nthis scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system notherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves nearly in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever ni needed extrastrength tylenol after that part noh and the films conclusion talk about repetitive npeople who saw know what you did last summer will predict still knows ending at least minutes before it happens nboring ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them nits usually fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who do nt seem to mind participating in mass mystery science theater type viewing ni still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is nif it were nt for the main actresses revealing wardrobes have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel ni ca nt imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem times better in theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and would nt recommend it to people unless they re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy ni read on website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works nwhat depressing thought nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act nrated this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and couple nubile horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted nid say this is unsuitable for kids but teens would nt have problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the films target audience

bas far as mystery men is concerned the burning question is less is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer the answer there is an unequivocal yes and more how in the name of sweet jesus did firsttime director kinka usher get such firstrate cast to act in this muck mystery men features greg kinnear as the heavilysponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis singular casanova frankenstein na veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title who join forces to get amazing out of tight spot when frankenstein puts the screws on champion city ntheres william macy as the mildmannered shoveler hank azaria as the cutleryflinging blue raja no knives but phony english accent that just as sharp ben stiller as mr furious whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar janeane garofalo as crazed bowler with her fathers skull interestingly preserved wes studi as rhetoricspouting cowled avenger and kel mitchell as the token and adding insult to injury invisible nblack guy nbringing up the rear so to speak is paul reubens yes that pee wee herman paul reubens as nwell lets just call him the gas man nthe production design is overblown the special effects are overdone and the script based on bob burdens dark horse comic book series is overbaked nthe appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar but they ca nt begin to save mystery men its just one big mess nyoure better off renting the video and pressing fastforward to get to the funny bits ni believe counted three
bdamn those trailers nhad it not been for the advertising of this film which reveals far too much about its contents would have been glued to under the sand nas it is the film retains some value thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling and more mature francois ozon in the directors chair nmarie charlotte rampling and her husband jean bruno cremer lounge on the beach nshe takes nap while he goes for swim nwhen marie wakes up jean is nowhere to be found nshe contacts authorities but they ca nt find him either ndid he disappear to start new life nwas he killed by accident ndid he commit suicide nmarie still asks herself these questions year later and in order to move on with her life she must find some answers nits fine premise and this little movie uses it to the limit nthe film moves at leisurely pace bit slow but relaxing nits very visual story and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie who shot the film in dreamy haze and the lead performance by rampling nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie you connect with her character instantly despite that she delusional nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband who she still believes is alive are heartbreaking nshe ca nt quite get over him ntheyve been married for twentyfive years nthe other actors particularly jacques nolot are excellent too nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded but compared to ozons criminal lovers its the disney channel nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards under the sand is fine movie going experience nwhile its hard to recommend as entertainment its fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss nozon seems to ask what you would do and that certainly hard question to answer
bsince the dramatic picture has undergone certain change of style nnow instead of emphasizing feelgood stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as schindlers list shows nmost of todays mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience nthats why pictures like october sky which are throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such welcome relief in contemporary cinema nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal teenager in the company town of coalwood west virginia nits wellknown fact that the only boys to make name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up to work in the coal mine nthe mine which is run by homers father chris cooper is not the place for homer however nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in homer feels connection with the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing did ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins to construct rockets nwith the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things noctober sky is skillfully crafted film and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston njohnston whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing wellknown titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what he doing here nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into plot that is straightforward and robust nhe does not push any barriers but instead adopts conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the films charm nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homers mother and father nthe cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles nlaura dern jurassic park lends strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need nher role is instantly likeable nchris cooper the horse whisperer as homers father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity to the movie nhes definitely driving force in homers life and his more humane moments give the piece certain dynamic that is commendable nthe script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in lighthearted manner nthere are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist nit highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps noctober sky should be success with audiences nalthough it does nt have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards nits welcome change to the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see

bhave you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life nor if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it nthese thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horrordrama since the sixth sense nstylishly filmed and tautly directed by xfiles alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teenspeak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars would nt use all the while developing into darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful but still suspenseful epilogue nat the start of the film yearold high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his student french class for field trip to paris nprogressively getting case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being the same as his september birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself nonce seated alex suddenly gets horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and teacher are thrown off narguing in the airport lobby alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all passengers including the rest of their classmates nas two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners ncarter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate nalexs best friend tod chad donella wants to stand by him but ca nt because of his fearful parents nthe teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to fellow coworker nonly outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life nthat is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better nsuffice to say the film does indeed turn into slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself nthe setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years ngraphic and brilliantly orchestrated in rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you do nt know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away ndevon sawa rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in underseen slashercomedy idle hands is even more of charismatic presence here nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he was nt meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part none scene in which he is watching news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful nali larter varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as girl whose life was going well until her father died in convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father nthe other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather onedimensional nthe movie is mainly sawas however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles ntony todd candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for fiveminute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just little too stilted and campy nultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created premise that has never been seen before in this manner and film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films nif anything its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again
bim not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream nmaybe its because they re both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which guess includes me nbut this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the know what you did last summer soon to be flicks nit owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for more interesting feature nand it should have been nthis is basically rehash of the stepford wives the great film never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as ve been told with bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives nor something like that behavior starring katie holmes of dawsons creek deals with bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers nsuckups npreppies nit actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when you re dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit nalas its not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it ni remember film called white mans burden which dealt with reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise nheres another one nit could be brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves nits stage and this film does in fact realize that nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly nnow it just needs to work as film nwhich it does nt nits too sloppy and too contrived nit paints bleak portrait of high school life then nlets it lie nit brings us bunch of scary monsters who are all bunch of disgustingly icky kissups who do food drives and hang out at diner drinking milk shakes then ngives it cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal nisnt it scary enough that they re like this and ca nt the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die nthe film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they re not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who having trouble at home because he has nt gotten over his brothers ethan embry in quick flashes so you do nt recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawsons creek who chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who the most interesting because he the only character who given some dimension nin the films best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each ones fetishes and hangups and its the best scene in the movie because its witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film is nt ngavin suspects there something awry with the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve he only treated as typical raving conspiracy buff nhere we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor nthe only other halfinteresting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but nreally we do nt care anyway ni probably should nt mention that this was directed by david nutter who works for the xfiles because that would probably tarnish his reputation nlike the show he good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating general creepy feel nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with good payoff nhe keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just do nt get the hell out of there ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there something rotten in the state of teen angstdom nwhat this film needs to be is lot longer lot more colorful and lot creepier nif the best villain they can come up with is guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with tougher smarter villain nif he so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who could nt figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in couple minutes nthe film which runs about or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become lot less sloppy nat such short running time and with such lame boring characters as these its pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves horribly unsatisfied taste in ones mouth especially mine
bplunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony nnaturally this got me worried nwould jakes talent be inherited from ridley or tony nif it was from ridley than the movie would be thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in nif it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel nunfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller clean cut gentleman nas the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler nhot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead nplunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced there very little merit contained in the film ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script nthe five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie there very little development in the story nalso major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened nthe story is bit of mess frankly nthe performances are nt bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is huge disappointment as the love interest nher irritable stilted performance sticks out like sore thumb and was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on nshe looks nice though nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well nken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but flat character ni did nt particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived nalthough disappointment in writing and minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets nbut production design alone ca nt save movie especially movie as bad as this mess njake scott would be more suited to directing music video rather than this failed update of period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with ck this and stand and cking deliver splattered all over the place nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty nplunkett macleane is massive disappointment nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts its so light it could float off the screen if it was nt just images on reel ntheres no thought no development no plot just series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to genxers nalthough its great idea update period drama to the mtv generation its execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless its hard to recommend plunkett macleane as movie but easy to recommend it as overlong music video ngive it miss
bjaneane garofalo in romantic comedy it was good idea couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker nthis is bythebooks movie that plods along on predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs nit also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too ngarofalo plays campaign aide to massacusetts senator jay sanders running for reelection ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that made the kennedy family so popular nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit nshe soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town ca nt get hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has dog piss on her luggage and so on nthen comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute nit happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way nin the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds nude sean david ohara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side nno points for guessing its the same dog that just made water on her luggage nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight nthats how it works in movies like these ni know from the instant saw that irishman in the bathtub that shed hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which they reconcile in time for happy irish tune to play over the end credits ni have nt mentioned the movies twist yet ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into future of bliss nmilo oshea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together nrest assured hell do all he can to match up garofalo and ohara noh and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability he dies toward the end nwhat the message here nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with weak script ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together nleary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole nhe even undoes himself with the old microphones still on after he done giving the speech cliche nboth of them should have known better
bthis is the best british gangster film since the long good friday njon bennet played by andrew howard is an extremely good assassin nas such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him nhe has become an unquestioning weapon nhe is in the employ of kingpin david calder far more evil than he is nbut even assassins have innocent pasts nhe runs into an old from school days and he is married to mutual girl friend from school ncomplicating matters is that they live near where he had recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime na big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin ncalder is familiar actor in britain though not frequently seen in the us nhe was seen in the world is not enough nhere he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years nhe is at once seductive and repellent like beautiful venomous snake nhis lair is underground apparently in sewer where he lives like the king of sewer rats nit is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennets life npaul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as cinematographer and like the kingpins lair he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness nby using semidarkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world nthis is world that is cold and unfriendly nsorossy creates world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see nthis is film with great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach nwe see very little but we hear great deal more and we imagine more than that nthe screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross but it is sarossys film all the way nit creates indelible images of evil ni rate it an on the to scale and low on the to scale do hope they do not use the tagline do nt mess with mr inbetween

bbill condons gods and monsters is fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein nsince was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations nwhale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age to quit filmmaking once homosexual scandal broke out involving him nas the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home njames whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film dirty old man nin one of the opening scenes young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing nbecause of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off nclayon agrees and does nt really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past ncertainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for downfall since whale starts to grow deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as motion picture director rather than horror director nand in one heartbreaking scene he attends party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore nit is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as sad but dignified man and person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself nhe never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him great person nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life nalthough boone is only in deadend job as gardener of peoples homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is goodlooking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him nsince whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is little thin and the structuring of the onagainoffagain friendship at the films center is fairly predictable nwe know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds nin lesser hands this setup might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this nalso subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and waitress working at bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone nthe film also plays as tribute to fine man who met an untimely end nwalking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably nit is sad testament when persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one elses business in the first place
bin my review of the spy who shagged me postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by third movie that is bore nthe cause is probably complacency studio sighs with relief when part lives up to expectations and figures part is sure thing scream provides the latest proof of this rule nin los angeles production has begun on stab return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell nhowever life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed nsmelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her exboyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name nuntil she gets phone call from familiar evil voice nthe late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of trilogy nhe notes the third chapter in trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and huge backstory to contend with nindeed scream tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidneys mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream nat the scene of each murder in scream the killer leaves photo of sidneys mother maureen as teenager in hollywood and even includes note claiming to be her real killer nto find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureens missing years when she was starlet appearing in lowbudget horror films even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killers relationship to sidney is nunlike its predecessors scream does nt have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we do nt even care who the killer is nthe jaded detective patrick dempsey nthe kinky producer lance henriksen nthe driven young director scott foley nthe ingenue emily mortimer nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one secret so its quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen nthe series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious npossibly its the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe its that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes cliche ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated momentformoment in the hollywood set of her home nat some point referencing becomes just means to cover up poverty of new ideas scream also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles nlook for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search nanother prediction made in previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project web strategy scream has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie nthe sunrise studios site scream com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab news ntheres also gail weathers official site galeweathers com and sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series nwhile hope that true do nt hold out much hopehorror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters ntheres halloween hk in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in and freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off ntheres bound to be scream someday even if it starts over with new set of moviestar wannabes nbottom line they should have called this one yawn
bwhen the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than grade action movie nhowever since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt nhowever the very first scenes show clear grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch nhowever the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap nso he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt nin the process he meets gios mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too nalthough it does nt stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable grade action routine nnobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too nhowever this is nt reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day

brecently one night young director named baz luhrmann could nt sleep nhe tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour nthen he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food nthen he took down volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover never really paying attention to the words or plot nand then as climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button nthe result nwilliam shakespeares romeo juliet the worst film ever made and complete failure nthough to be fair an interesting complete failure nthe idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds nthis is done by moving the camera around at rapid rate so that we ca nt see what is going on nand filming the dialogue in voice over nand shooting leonardo dicaprio like calvin klein model nand making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom nand filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion ni mean man this is the dude nhowever ve seen terrible films that are fun to watch examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau that rule does nt apply here nthis is film that takes itself seriously nthat is its major fault nanother problem was pointed out by my friend alex who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout the original play is powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and did nt take sides nhere its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo just look at the way they film him from the begining he our hero and this does nt work nand dicaprios awful performance does nt help nluhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us nthe result is mess nyou can feel him striving to be something he is nt nhe tries to pull of mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles nhe tries very hard nkey word tries oh look he filming above water action from below npretty nwhat does it represent nwhy do people do ugly things ni scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if could never read the play again and keep straight face
badam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy the wedding singer nunfortunately that also has the effect of softening his edge nhes nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore not that it was much of one nhes certainly not helped here by rather frail plot nthe year is letting the whole film obsess with nostalgia nadam sandler is nice guy robbie the titular wedding singer who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic hits nrobbies life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee linda angela featherstone leaves him at the altar nhowever things are looking up when he meets julia drew barrymore waitress at the hall nshes the perfect woman but for one small flaw she engaged to be married to slick junk bond king glenn matthew glave nso most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love and his attempts to stop the wedding nas far as plots go its pretty thin and tired one nto fill the gaps the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of nostalgia nfrom boy george to michael jackson from miami vice to dallas from the first cds to the last rubiks cubes this film revels in all the minutiae nand then there the music nlearning lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank and romy and micheles high school reunion this film packs more songs in the film than the running time will allow nas result most songs get maybe lyric or half but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes the wedding singer vols and nwhile the nonstop riffs get incredibly tiring at least they distract you from the plot nat least last years my best friends wedding stirred up the standard keep your true love from marrying someone else plot by making the rival nice person nhere glenn is such lowly rat of man that you never see what julia saw in him nbarrymore on the other hand is simply charming as julia nwhich leaves us with adam sandler nhes at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades little such as when he has breakdown on stage during wedding reception nwhen he in full niceguy mode he more pathetic than endearing nthe film boasts several cameos most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz nbut none of them work well at all nbuscemis role as drunken best man simply fails to be humorous nlovitz on the other hand as rival wedding singer makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live where he was actually funny nthe only cameo which has some appeal is guest appearance by classic rocker during the films finale surprisingly one of the only plotrelated scenes which actually works nadam sandler still has some work to do before he can become dependable leading man nwhile he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer the end result is no net gain
bslavery is bad nafter hundreds of years we ve finally figured that one out nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielbergs latest serious film nduring the late portuguese slave ship carries cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africas west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery nfiftythree of them are stuffed into the la amistad from spanish word for friendship by their new spanish owners nfreeing himself from his chains senge pieh djimon hounsou renamed cinque by his masters leads bloody revolt nafter killing most of the crew the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home or so they think ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property nif they are property who do they belong to ntheir masters nthe spanish government nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship nthe us government nthe defendants are pawns in several games nabolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard want to free them but tappan sees them primarily as means to further the cause ntheir lawyer roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey views the case as simple one of property rights and chance to make his share of legal fees nsouth carolina senator john calhoun arliss howard pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states npresident martin van buren nigel hawthorne is willing to force the result towards his own political ends nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes neven that does nt work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims nat the urging of calhoun the president then appeals the case to the supreme court populated by majority of slaveowners nthis littleknown try finding it in any history text book incident from americas past would have gone down darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court nthe slavery issue is easy pickins for spielberg nmuch like his shindlers list which followed jurassic park as this follows lost world the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose nnazis and slave traders both treat groups of others as less than human nits not hard to see who the bad guys are nwithout that question to ponder the directors job is more difficult nhe has to make the story interesting nspielberg succeeds for the most part nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach nwhere the movie falls down is bit more subtle nthere are very few people in the tale nin fact cinque is the only character who is fleshed out ntappan and joadson are abolitionists symbols but not humans nvan buren is weak politician but nothing else nthe rest of the slaves barely exist other than dressing for the set nlike many other films about people of color almost all the major players are white nthe films salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou nthe former models first major role is winner nwithout speaking more than five words of english he conveys more emotion than most actors with thousand lines of dialog nthe other standout is hopkins who seems to be making career out of portraying american presidents he also played the title role in nixon nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best courtroom drama ever on the screen nthere are some other great moments nespecially impressive are the africans struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant nas grand as the epic is it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it fourstar film michael redman has written this column for real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some films
bafter having heard so many critics describe return to me as an oldfashioned hollywood romance kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance nwhat made return to me oldfashioned and oldhollywood nwas it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on nwas it the glamorous sophisticated feel nthe charisma of the two leads neven now ca nt say that have gotten any closer to the real answer because have nt see that many oldfashioned hollywood romances ni do nt think any of the romances ve seen have been classified as such nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was oldfashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider nit was traditional magical nwe knew it could nt be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in nit was romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it could nt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings nthe film owes lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction nfrom the very first birds eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell were in for something sweet nthe scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just hint of fantasy nreal people do nt act that way real people are nt that nice nwe know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of fairytale but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with hint of the ethereal neverything is ordinaryyet beautifulin this film nfrom the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bobs wardrobes nfrom the eloquent notinahurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together group of actors who blend in effortlessly as family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist nwe care for them laugh with them cry with them were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father nwhatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors ndisappointingly david alan griers charlie however much like him was the most flatlywritten nduchovny here does laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow costars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder ninstead we have normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the xfiles nduchovny who is excellent at understatement and selfdeprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but good heart to offer nthough an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses nwhile return to me functions remarkably as laughoutloud comedy romantic scenic tour through chicago and tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart nwe already know that there going to be happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in straight line going towards that point nas result bob and grace click almost too quicklyyes know she supposed to have his exwifes heart and everythingit seems too effortless nthe main subject is love story and the family scenes love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all nhowever in the spirit of return to me it wo nt do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories ni loved knowing that this was labor of love for bonnie hunt nit shows nthe bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you had nt imagined
baliens well that is what this movie is about ncomputer generated aliens nok the movie is not just about computer generated aliens nits about computer generated aliens and secret organization known as mib nif one was nt green and running around the other would not exist as its known nthe computer graphics in this movie are spectacular they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits nsince seeing this movie have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien he simply has to be nwell in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft squishy and cuddly kind njust adds something of lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark nalong with aliens comes the humor and in pretty decent way nj well soon to be smart ass cop played by will smith runs down what he thinks is wouldbe villain and gets some attention from the mib and in particular nk aims to recruit our poor but that is not the whole point of this movie nthe main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as home or refuge nthats also the main point of this movie protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy nsome of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty ncolor commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch nthe dialogue is witty to say the least nthis wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie ntommy lee jones as and will smith as provide both the action and the comedy beautifully nthe characters they play do nt seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them ni would have to say that is more amusing than but what one without the other nboth roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors nthe story also goes deep enough to provide proper background so the audience is not totally clueless naltogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create good movie na movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor nas most movies have their good things they also have their bad things nthe character development in this movie was not all that grand because it did nt need to be nbut if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie nespecially the evil alien he did need some work nthough this could have been worked on the movie was what it proposed to be rather shallow and witty comedy nthat was achieved rather well with some interesting commentary and observations na movie worth view but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smiths form of humor then would nt go noriginally written after original release ntotally rewritten december
bive never been huge fan of jeff bridges but loved him in the big lebowski nthe part of jeff the dude lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind and the fit is perfect nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles hippie slob on bowling team with soft spot for white russians nhes enjoying leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy but not before they urinate on his rug nthe dude assumes that these collection agents were after another jeff lebowski famous millionaire who also lives in so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug nthe millionaire refuses but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped nhe wants the dude to act as gobetween for the kidnapers ndude and his friend walter john goodman take on the task and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers millionaires high schoolers nihilists artists pornographers thugs and league bowlers ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres so take my recommendation as you will for me the big lebowski is very funny nit is an incredibly successful comedy the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films nnot only are the two leads bridges and goodman funny separately and together but each supporting character is refreshing comic figure nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived neach person may be comic caricature but there is always respectful selfacceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension nthe characters are firmly established and they never change their behavior for quick cheap laugh nits not what they do that funny its who they are which is why the acting is so important and so successful in this movie nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus that jeezus not haysoos the greaser bowler who in lusty marriage with the game julianne moore as the postpostfeminist artist whose work has been described as vaginal steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter and sam elliott as the rambling longwinded narrator naside from the performances what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue npeople lose trains of thought they interrupt they boast they repeat themselves they repeat their friends nthey sound natural ntaken with fargo the coen brothers last film it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers nethan coen is not just good at directing actors he also good at technical directing nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created beautiful world on film nperhaps beautiful is the wrong word nihilists carpetpissers and thugs are not objects of beauty nbut the bowling photography and series of vikingbowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film nall around the big lebowski is great solid comedy noutstanding acting writing direction and photography all combine to make this great comic success
sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long nindeed nand any filmmaker with three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in review non more positive note let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length nthe mile in question green due to its faded limecolored linoleum leads from the prison cell to old sparky the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisianas cold mountain penitentiary in npaul edgecomb tom hanks you ve got mail is the head guard of eblock otherwise known as death row nkeeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility nit is responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they talk to the convicts instead of yelling at them nthis practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars ninto his charge comes one john coffey michael clarke duncan armageddon seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls nimmediately paul senses something different about this prisoner nperhaps its the way he asked for night light because he is frightened of the dark nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he takes back pauls bladder infection thereby restoring him to health nbased on steven kings serialized novel the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told eduard delacroix michael jeter patch adams is frail cajun convict who befriends and trains mouse to do circus tricks percy wetmore doug hutchison time to kill is young and sadistic guard sitting on transfer to more lucrative position because he has yet to see prisoner fry up close and hal moores james cromwell babe pig in the city is the compassionate warden for whom despite all the executions he witnessed death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with tumor nwhile it is mr hanks everyman performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for minutes it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting nall involved do credible work in their respective roles most especially mr duncan who turns in an impressive fully realized characterization nif only the story were more credible nwriterdirector frank darabont the shawshank redemption has crafted flawed fantasyallegory of sorts one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual relying on preternatural mysticism rather than genuine and godly spiritual power nmr darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters nwas it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed nby not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on eblock the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted nthis is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched nmuch has also been made of coffeys christlike ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures coffeys powers are shrouded in mystery taking on the feel of circus trick coupled with voodoolike feel your pain transference nin contrast there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god nthe genuine gifts of healing listed in corinthians is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god ntrue spiritual healing with few exceptions requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed nsuch believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism but from the revealed word of god

in dreams might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths nno the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standards nthe big letdown however comes upon the realization that this minute headscratcher was masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the crying game nhes no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope nthings start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondjis stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of underwater ghost town during creepy prologue that establishes notably grim tone right off the bat nthis eerie opulence remains dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film there even something macabre about the way khondji photographs rustic seemingly innocent new england autumn but if there ever was film that did nt deserve so good polish its this one ndont knock the look but say what you will about the foolish plot underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue nannette bening another asset in dreams should nt be so lucky to boast gives an increasingly effective performance in role that does nt do much for her in return nshe plays claire cooper massachusetts childrens book illustrator who plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children nshe thinks these visions are warning knell for horrible soontobecommitted crimes but neither her hohum husband aidan quinn nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously nthis being thriller we know that she is in fact on the money and its credit to benings acting that she delves equally into claires madness and compassion nbut as soon as body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims in dreams trades in its nifty supernatural chills for long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense nscenes pile up like car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition nsubplots appear and disappear nwhen claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer robert downey jr it turns out his name is vivian he clairvoyant and he got some major issues with mama la norman bates in dreams reaches its absurdist zenith here and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists nsome questions then what with the garbage disposal retching applesauce nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own nwhat about the computer ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan nis the woman in australia integral to anything nand the aforementioned flooded city what function does that really serve nsigh nat least in my own dreams can imagine better movie where certain talent did nt go to waste
bive noticed something lately that ve never thought of before npseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films nhave you ever seen movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing nmore and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff nim not trying to say city of angels is that bad nit had lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered nsomehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment nbut for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nnicolas cage is seth guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life nmeg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is were fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive nafter losing patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patients transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor nhe begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday nangels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire nseths adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such thing seems taboo among the angelic community nthe angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but its nice touch that never seems like mere attempt at uniqueness ncage is wonderfully versatile actor think faceoff raising arizona and it could happen to you what combo who slips into the role of heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once nits nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire nthe two are nt very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and its an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye nits shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just did nt know quite how to get to it nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for minutes that this film is glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths nbased on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending nmost movie goers the noncynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized nnonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate delve into rich emotional territories

bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nthe teaser trailers for my best friends wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy lighthearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more frankly rarely seen trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friends wedding was such success strong bouyant romanticcomedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring triumphant performance from ms roberts nthe heroine of my best friends wedding is julianne potter julia roberts successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made pact with her dear best friend and exlover michael oneal dermot mulroney sports writer that if they both had nt married by the time they reached they had promised to marry each other nboth julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michaels age julianne realizes that he mere weeks away from his th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives phone call from michael later that day nhowever she finds herself even more distraught when michaels call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary nthe setup for my best friends wedding then is fairly conventional one and in many ways the films storyline is formulaic but only to certain extent the film was directed by hogan whose first feature muriels wedding had quite an offbeat tone for traditional uplifting uglyduckling story and the same holds true for my best friends wedding which confidently combines traditional romanticcomedy elements with really eccentric sense of humour nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan nfor example there heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background nmy best friends wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of musical as woody allens everyone says love you even assert its more successful one nmy best friends wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well nin typical romanticcomedy kimmy would be portrayed as snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmys life shed actually like her too nthe george character is almost staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friends wedding he gets to have playful mischievous and charming personality nthroughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romanticcomedy are given little twists and the result is film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion nthere is lot of smart writing in the wellpaced screenplay by ronald bass were given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments nmy best friends wedding marks strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in topnotch confident and reassured performance as julianne nthis is nt the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne characters neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable neven better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in shining performance in my best friends weddding nwith smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmys insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits false note in the film nshe even sings wo nt soon forget her charming serenade of just do nt know what to do with myself nrupert everett is given very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film nhis george is bit of devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everetts performance is delight to watch he clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous ndermot mulroney is adequate in thankless role unlike the other characters in the film he not given lot to do but there is genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic nwhen julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as americas sweetheart by sandra bullock thought it was canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says love you to raise her profile nwhile that did nt quite work out its nearcertain that her successful return to the genre which made her big star back in the romanticcomedy will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game nmy best friends wedding marks return to form for ms roberts and cements hogans reputation as skilled director of comedy
bwhen casting the key part of the voice of moses most peoples first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer the saint and the island of dr nmoreau but he was dreamworkss choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt nthe selection of kilmer proved to be wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took was nt in the casting department nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make biblical epic la cecil demille to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones nin the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children nanimated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies now that is something fresh nlet me admit upfront that was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off ndreamworkss antz seemed to be movie not quite appropriate for any age group nthe prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz but it is much more satisfying nlike antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixars bugs life the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices ndanny glover is the voice of jethro jeff goldblum of aaron steve martin of hotep helen mirren of the queen michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti nyou can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god nthe movie which is weakest in the story department is cliffs notes version of demilles the ten commandments nthe script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in mosess life ndemille took over three and half hours in order to do it justice nat less than half of that the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it does nt establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters nwe meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket nwe watch him grow up and become best bud and chariot racing partner to ramses ralph fiennes the future pharaoh nmoses is free spirit and practical joker until he finds out his true identity as jew all ve ever known to be true is lie moses complains nafter finding out his real identity he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him nafter leaving egypt moses comes back to ask ramses to let mosess people go nthis leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally handdrawn animation of the most of the production nit is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling ndrawn with rich palette of luxurious roses blues and golds the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last nthe construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust and other scenes are shot with the glow of rising sun nthe most original visual sequence in the film occurs during dream moses has ndone with an explicit twodimensional look the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story neven though it has its weaknesses the prince of egypt is noble attempt to carve out new genre serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family nthis aweinspiring movie deserves to be seen nthe prince of egypt runs about nit is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family nhow old kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child but those over will probably like it
bfrom the commercials this looks like mildmannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight ninstead it turns out to be hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way nthe movie demonstrates just how far good script and actors can take mundane idea nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by woman from the agency who located his parents nfollowing one dead end lead after another each funnier than the previous they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents alan alda and lily tomlin nits difficult to condense the mileaminute plot nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you chance to recover from the last one nwithout giving too much away one of the better episodes involves gay federal alcohol tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bisexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion nand its all done in fairly clean almost well maybe not exactly family fare manner na grand cast tomlin alda moore ben stiller patricia arquette tea leoni george segal interacts in seamless parade of laughs ndrawing from more hyper woody allen style the film succeeds beyond expectations
bplot human space astronaut accidentally falls upon planet ruled by apes nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans and tries his best to escape his simian captors noh yeah and did mention that the apes can talk nkewl ncritique despite this film not looking like tim burton movie or its lead human character showing any signs of being human being himself did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun summer fare nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape makeup jobs and characterizations ni mean was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ni also have to give it up to all of the actors inside the costumes not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get makeup slobbered all over them for hours but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well ni especially enjoyed bonham carters performance who believed to be the most developed character in the entire film human or ape and tim roths bad guy who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part nplotwise liked the beginning of the film the whole buildup once wahlberg got into the village the escape and most of the fight scenes but once things got out into the deserted area and the final battle sequence kinda lost bit of my interest ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of human beings as animals then was about the end battle sequence which just seemed bit too typical for this kind of film ni also hated the kid character who just got on my nerves and did nt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved wo nt ruin it here but cmon guys you ncoulda thought of something little more plausible than that no nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his interspecies love interests nthis dude did nt seem to give rats ass about anyone but himself and ultimately did nt really care about what happened to him either nnow not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script but the film suffered because of it nvisually the movie was also nice to look at especially the apes but definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton nthe surprise ending that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in felt little tacked on here and despite being interesting did nt really make all that much sense to me unless you look at it from sequel point of view nso overall loved the whole feel of the planet the apes that ruled it the manner in which they treated the humans screamed shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain but did nt appreciate the films lack of human character development why was kris kristofferson even in this movie and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring nbut would still recommend this film as fun summer movie with laughs creepiness and really cool premise nps for anyone who has seen the original can not believe that they did nt at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character in this case mark wahlberg goes nuts at the world in which he suddenly been thrust this is mad house ntype of thing nthe guy in this film barely seems to be put off by the fact that he surrounded by apes who can speak english nwheres joblo coming from nthe arrival battlefield earth godzilla instinct mission to mars pitch black planet of the apes sleepy hollow
bcity of angels is the kind of love story that enjoy the most thoughtprovoking moving and completely unsentimental ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality ncity of angels is wonderful film enhanced by interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years nits love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches were so used to seeing in films like this ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders film wings of desire ni have yet to see wings of desire so am unfortunately unable to make comparison of the two ni have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film is nt ripoff of its source material nnicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it none day he is forced to take the life of patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans but they ca nt experience any of the senses most importantly touch nhe shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status nseth wants to become human so he can feel her nthats when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as side note found messinger to be the most fascinating character for can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally welldone after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with man who can feel nthis of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what its like to have split lip and blood oozing from his forehead nsince love this film so much ill make minor note that it certainly is nt perfect nalthough it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to few of the cliches of the genre nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done great job with them nthe ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable nthese elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels nthe acting is superb from everyone involved nthis is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock nhes quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words nhes perfect for role like this and at the same time he reassures us he not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in faceoff nmeg ryan is powerful enticing and appealinglychirpy actress and her work here is some of her best ndennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel nwhat admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation ndirector brad silberling is talented man and he knows that story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality nhis direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell mother and her two children that their father is dead nthere is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information nthis is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real nthe film also appeals to the senses in way that few love stories do ncinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images ve seen on the big screen hundreds of blackclad angels stand on dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example nthe music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film its quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of so far nall of this adds up to film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre nits film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously

bunderwater science fiction stays submerged nsphere film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in movie theater is when cast of fine actors end up in film that wastes their talents nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered npsychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of plane crash nwhen he arrives at the site he discovers that there is no plane but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting feet below the surface for almost years nhaving written paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship nhis group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone biochemist harry adams samuel jackson mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist nunfortunately it turns out that the writing was blowoff project for goodman who did it for the money and named his thencolleagues to the team after all he explains who reads government documents nlead by harold barnes peter coyote top secret federal operative the group descends to mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel nonce there they stroll over knock on the door and explore the stilloperational ufo ndiscovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere nwhen adams enters the sphere the weirdness unfolds na storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer my name is jerry ni am happy flashes across the screen nthis is unsettling for the psychologist what happens if jerry gets mad he asks nbarnes is more pragmatic he needs last name because he ca nt put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry nthen the situation turns bad ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel nlethal sea snakes attack goodman na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading leagues under the sea nthe suspicious scientists turn against each other nthis has all the makings of firstrate thinking mans science fiction film nhowever even the finest ingredients do nt go very far in the hands of chief who does nt seem to care about his product ndirector barry levinson has churned out mishmosh that does nt engage the audience beyond few skillful suspense scenes nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification nits much like speedreading novel and realizing that you missed the nuances nit does nt get any better when the action scenes begin nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited neven goodman and halperins illconceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing nher psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing ntheres truism that items shown early in movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious nwhen an emergency minisub is explained you know what going to happen nthe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting nchapter headings that divide the movie have no function nthe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos nmuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable great deal of it is nt neven science fiction film must be internally consistent ntheres too much here that does nt make sense nare the manifestations real nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa in throwaway role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect na scene in the sub suggests that its illusion but earlier episodes indicate that its not nnot everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers nwhere the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in is merely alluded to neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll nthe climax is followed by minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale nafter prerelease audience testing the actors were called back to reshoot the ending nits difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours nthe weak scenes could have been cut but then there would nt have been much left nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work but there nothing special on the screen nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm nstealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them nremarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing film is wag the dog smart and entertaining piece of work nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word
bafter rather disappointing mary railly stephen frears is now officially back in business with comeback worthy of praise nthis is one of the best surprises of this season sweet small budget comedy with big heart nin fact its not even comedy nits drama or even more precise clever satire on human relationships and needs nbased on critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby high fidelity is wry and likable story about mans quest for fulfillment and happiness nrob gordon was dj nit seems that he could make everything spin except his own life nnow he owns championship vinyl little musical store somewhere in new york nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend gorgeous blond attorney life suddenly looses every purpose ndecimated humiliated and on the verge of mental and emotional breakdown he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been about what right and what important nhe starts categorizing life dividing it into top lists nand the most important is the top list over the most painful breakups of his life starting with th grade when he found his young girlfriend with another boy nthough you might think that people change grow more mature with age it just does nt seem that way and all robs relationships were different versions of that first nwhere did he go wrong nwas it he that screwed up nor maybe life just stinks nwhile he is lost in his own selfpity he must think of the top list over his needs for the future find the right elements and mix his life together nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity music and with incredibly direct narration it addresses the average audience member in other words people like you and me nalthough lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter and frears the director the acting is equally important as the written word nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned nhe is simply superb nit is as much his movie as it is frears nthe film would not be the same without him ncusack whose character is sadder wiser and brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera not an easy task but cusack pulls it off nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply ca nt be ignored or overseen nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job nboth and jack black are fabulous neven catherine zeta jones appears in role where she actually acts not just looks beautiful nhowever the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers spectacular comic performance as robs coworker and friend dick nthis is such an impressive achievement that its almost worth oscarnomination nhe is simply joy to behold notherwise everyone are in their place and at the right time all part of frears colorful blend npretty much like edward nortons keeping the faith this film does nt follow any formula or belong to any genre its dramatic tragic sarcastic comic and even cynical but never bitter or angry nits little bit of everything pretty much like life itself nnothing seems unreal or staged nit reflects reality as mirror nas you watch it you go through the same emotional problems as the main character nyou feel and think and reflect nthis effect has become rarity nowadays nalthough its primarily about the perils of love high fidelity is secondarily about pop music nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees timid dick todd louiso and overbearing barry jack black are fellow music snobs nmusic is the language in their lives the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives nand so does the movie nit is as much musical film as anything else as robs journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments nin the end you have gained something while watching it nits not the film of the century or even of the year nits not an special effects extravaganza nit does nt require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed nits small movie about the big things nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy you feel as if you have experienced something of significance and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time

cooking nis it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely nprobably not nbobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drapehanging and other domestic issues njust as those issues are starting up graces husband jake storms in looking like checkout day of the elks lodge convention njust beats bobby silly nbobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace na little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake nthem murderous arizonians ngotta love em nif any of this sounds familiar congratulations nyou win kewpie doll nthe story is straight shoplift of red rock west cult favorite few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction nbut the contest does nt end there guys and gals nwe get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty nwe get the town from bad day at black rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak nlook at any schwarzenegger film and you ll see our hero bobby as bobby has mudhole stomped in his keister dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got shaving nick nbobby as terminator nstretch it bit and we have fivefinger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic nokay he working from book so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas ni just expect man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft few original ideas before exposing the negative ni just wish he had nt brought cast like this together for what amounts to group toestub nsean penn gives great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing overthetop caricatures of stereotype characters nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on ntoo bad its not fun to watch when its happening to us while nwe sit through this mess of film nuturn is not bad film if you re fan of technique nits the oliver stone you ve always known nrobert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures nbut pictures of what ni think rather stare at xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tiltowhirl point of this loser film nplot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ve seen in the past five years noliver know your body of work is nothing to sniff at nyouve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on nyour scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors do nt dog it nand know that maybe with uturn you were just kicking back just having fun nthats fine nbut do nt do that with movie with the potential of this one ndo some police academy sequel imagine that ndo big comedy like remake of its mad mad mad mad world nbut do not drop limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like weekold snook ntheres right way to have fun and wrong way to have fun nthis was as wrong as you can get without going to jail

bif there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films its their predictable endings nthe devils advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does nunfortunately for the devils advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film nnevertheless the film does provide two and half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ni do nt think was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan nwell it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that nthe devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session nkevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for client whom has been accused of raping young girl nhe ends up with notguilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose good jury nhe accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife nafter proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as criminal lawyer nhe graciously accepts where he is treated almost as god nhe is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and hefty paycheck nhis life seems to be on the rise nand of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment nmary ann takes up friendship with neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted nmeanwhile kevin nabs case surrounding alexander cullen craig nelson who apparently murdered three people nhe spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself nafter while things turn completely upsidedown as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends na fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevins real father nis it all just big nightmare nor is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevins life nthe devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we do nt expect nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed nif so the devils advocate messes up completely and ironically felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than would have if it had ended ten minutes early ni went into the devils advocate expecting shocking horror film and that is exactly what got ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what got nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did mention that did nt like the ending nthe producers of this film take you on thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you nfilms like seen and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way nthe devils advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing lot but knowing nothing at all nif that is confusing recommend watching the film and then reading that again nas for the film overall enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study nthe film runs like wellbuilt clock slowly building until finally exploding with highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that nand then you settle in for nice resolution which does not occur nit was at this point that felt cheated ntaking us on terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film neverything occurs from his perspective nhe is our representation on screen sort of nbut we are forced to witness conclusion which makes most of the film seem like game ni do nt want to spoil the ending so all can say is go see the film and decide for yourself nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything nit earned its rating for reason nthere is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity nthis film really is nt subtle about anything showing us everything nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating as it is quite harsh nhowever the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those ni do nt condone sex and nudity in films but if its there might as well enjoy it nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary anns problems are incredibly intense and found myself wanting to witness her decline nthis may sound uncaring but wanted to watch because felt sorry for her nshe is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into world where she is not wanted nsomething the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for film of this nature nthe story actually has something to say about humanity nin one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity nthen god sets up rules which contradict human nature nthis semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening nwhat milton says is so true about our society that found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but sure they came straight from the novel it was based on nwhen film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched nthe cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we do nt expect nheather matarazzo makes brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does great job nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves nhe has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance ni have never seen him more believable to date nal pacino is of course the scene stealer nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term njeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off also gives good performance as eddie barzoon njudith ivey manages credible performance as the mother who holds secret to kevins past nconnie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times none familiar face with twist was coach star craig nelson who gives very good performance nthe devils advocate is rated for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore nat minutes this film moves along fairly quickly nfor the first two hours sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters nthe technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and good musical score ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create very disturbing motion picture only to ruin good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that went into the theater expecting disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for long time nbut just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream npersonally would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early
bi want to be involved in show business one day nand refuse to do any sequels to any movie may make because believe they only get worse nthis movie proves it for me ni was little worried about the last batman film as thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up ni also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne nthey did nt nkilmer did good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and ca nt stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles nthis film is different nthe cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction he one of those directors who good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith does nt really give an impressive cast anything to do nthe cast is impressive clooney is surprisingly good waynebatman odonnell is crafty robin as usual they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is good poison ivy nthe major problem is schwarzenegger who is terrible freeze nhis accent is so heavy you ca nt understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they can not act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say limited amount of stuff and kill bunch of guys then they figure nobodyll notice nthats the trouble with me notice nschwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does npatrick stewart was the person heard that was considered to play freeze and he would ve been so much better nor sean connery but not arnold not an actor but play one in real life schwarzenegger ni realize that you must be star to play major role in batman film but it would ve been nice if they casted star that had talent for the role nakiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in normal batman film nin regular batman film they concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend little more but elle macphersons julie madison is so limited here that we never get real sense of who she is nthere is talk of fifth batman movie nmy interest to see it is low but hope its better than this nif you do nt want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster nany other
ba pseudointellectual film about the pseudointellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drugaddled protagonists nin the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenkos script or direction makes you care much about either character nliving in world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other nthis uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has receptionist that reads dostoevski and woman in the restroom line who is certified genius having recently been awarded prestigious mcarthur grant nyearold syd radha mitchell who has rather bland livein boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame nalthough the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy nfor her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her nlucy lives with her current lover washed up german actress named greta played with frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson nthe two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin nthis does not happen in single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture nsyd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes member of the zombie club nlucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother nlucy quit working professionally years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that that how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses na typical scene has the editors arguing about whether potential photographers work is transcendental or merely classical nthat no one has clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny your work has cultural currency that is important now is the artistspeak that the frames manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine nwhen the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of romantic line is want to get high with you nin lucys world sex and drugs come handinhand nand the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being hip and natural part of the art scene nthis vacuous picture throws in standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions nin another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted nhigh art runs nit is rated for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age

bi do nt box with kid gloves ni do nt play nice not nice guy and never ever go easy on film ni consider it to be breech of some sort of code of ethics for movie critic nhowever do some favors and these often come in the form of points that hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery nrigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time ni still however will not go easy on them nthey recently sent me vhs copy of their down with america trilogy which begins quite wittily with disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film and decided to spend an hour of my day watching it nin the famous lines of many martyrs have no regrets nwell do have some regrets but that is not the point in the previous sentence nthe point of it was that down with america was film that from critical standpoint did not entirely disappoint me nsure the risky use of vhs instead of super mm or mm was pain and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable ndown with america concerns government agent needless murder and book containing everything from the unabombers manifesto to the apple computer profit report nlike the previous films of rigormortis that have reviewed it displays an offkilter humor and intelligence it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail nthe best way to see this film would be as parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the na dying movement from the day they started these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word roswell nin down with america the line roswell is highly absent nwith an about ten minute running time down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich that the conspiracy films fell into makes jokes at them at the same time and provides us with funny and memorable characters nagain have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters could nt care less about nthe film as previously stated concerns federal agent peter roach an obsessed librarian meri stevens mystery man joe kaczkowski and two people obsessed with silence in the library robb sherman kevin flowers nthe plot book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in public library where it can be viewed by all nfrom there we go into delightful parody nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth the librarian goes on diatribe about the sanctity of books nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give whole new meaning to noname it ends up being the noname people who do good job delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out nfor once do nt have url that know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of lauto and les xfiles and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself nits almost as much fun as the film
bmichael crichton has had long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of michael crichton science fiction novel nso in the logic of the film industry good way to make profitable film would be to make bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel ncongo failed and am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare whole lot better nit little better than just okay novel and it makes film that is not even that good nthe film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long minutes has terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting nseveral years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered nthe plan he wrote was only semiserious but did explicitly define team of experts who should investigate the alien nnow that team has been assembled by mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study spacecraft almost half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early nsuddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with real alien spacecraft nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects nthe problem here is he is making bigbudget science fiction film nit has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on radar screen nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting nthat could be reasonable approach in lowbudget film nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they do nt nhoffmans acting seems muted njackson seems to laid back nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance nand why we have queen latifah as minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at fraction of the price nlook how much more powerful film like alien was with only moderate actors nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects nlevinson tries secondtier effects and firsttier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer nperhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium nthe result gets on the to scale and on the to scale
bill be the first to admit it nwhen you mention the book great expectations immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where was confronted with torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch nyes its classic of literature but it was rather dry one shoved down my young throat like spoonful of bitter medicine ncertainly the experience was nt truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book not going to tell the story the way it happened ill ngonna tell it the way remember it nanyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations ninstead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper nthe setting is the florida coast during the mids nfinn is blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects nduring one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro nborrowing page from the superhuman max cady deniros criminal has seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor nok maybe nthats an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film nand that nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat but digress nanyway finn does the convict good deed just to show that he really swell guy nand then the plot moves on nenter miss havisham or nms dinsmoor here anne bancroft nabandoned at the altar some years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid nwith bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role nalthough she ends up nowhere near believable character she does add some humor to the film njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult nfor no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella nperhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met girl before nin any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply does nt exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her neven when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude there nothing nin fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during similar scene in as good as it gets nat this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character and could nt care less about the two characters nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow nshe fails to imbue estella remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity ntheres obviously something wrong when watching the film you re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character nwithout strong estella finns obsession seems baseless nyou wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life nin fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot nfinns relationship with his brotherinlaw joe is interesting if bit stereotypical nwhats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro nalthough its only bit part it goes to show how much vitality strong actor can create nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put lot of work in creating the imagery of the film nsome of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact nfinns art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful nas result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeares romeojuliet nsimply update the action to modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations nas much as dreaded the novel when first read it you probably be better off suffering though reading than watching this romanceless film

bthis season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation nbut lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and know what you did last summer nbut switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting switchback opens with the murder of babysitter and the abduction of the young child she watching nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the kidnapperkiller is nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite while nhe is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest does nt keep him from offering pursuit nlacrosses most recent trek takes him to bloodsoaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff lee ermey is torn between his reelection campaign and helping his new ally catch his man nin related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinupplastered even on the seatbelts el dorado nalong the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto nthis tangent is nt random one as bob or lane will end up either holding piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself nor is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending to be after the coldhearted murderer he knows so much about nin sense that half of the basic problem with switchback nfor its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so were given little insight into who they are likely for fear that well learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction nbut switchback then decides to explicitly reveal the killers identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense nsome of the acting is burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves nwhat is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot nand dennis quaid that monotone stop it nermey is solid in supporting role that more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my socalled life is scenestealer tried and true nfrom material standpoint switchback is pretty empty nbut even when firsttime director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard does nt know what to do he knows what he wants it to look like the movie provides some great visuals nthe setonatrain climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor nstill that not enough to turn lump of coal into diamond and more than the movies look will end up leaving you cold
bthe generals daughter is heartless absurd film movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with hamhanded obscenity creating film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth nwhats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching dark conclusion in sudden rain storm njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell nbrenner is teamed up with exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods nsoon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who neberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story nperhaps should have issued spoiler alert before mentioning that but its painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something non story level the generals daughter is ineptly constructed nthe film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel which was apparently based on true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments nhaving not read the novel its difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but suppose they all are guilty to some degree nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed nto which would have answered if knew then the movie would already be over nonly after we ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored nnot that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot nin one scene sunderland is attacked by man in mask nshe sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring ninstead of questioning him like as they would real suspect they take him to brenners houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap nthis scene really pushed me over the edge not because its gratuitous and meanspirited but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as surprise ni realized that these constructs on screen are nt actually characters but devices present only to serve the story nthis would have been bad enough without the wests need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct ncompelling films about sexual crimes do nt spend lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly do nt show as much skin and sweat as typical pornographic picture nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary they re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be nin addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if its perversion of everything we know to be pure nthis standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with welldeveloped themes to back it up nas it is the film forgets that lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on pair of handcuffs does not make person insane nperhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are couple of the performances njames woods has few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety ni also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous nnonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization nthe generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments
bsynopsis humorless police officers life changes when he befriends supersmart superadorable golden retriever named einstein and cute young blond scientist nunfortunately einstein shares psychic link with bigfootsized apecreature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl nmeanwhile group of white chainsmoking guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie ncomments watchers reborn cheaply made directtovideo turkey is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers ntechnically this should have been called watchers but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequelcrazy film series has decided to drop the numbers from the titles even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be good movie instead of crappy fifth installment of film series which should have died long time ago nthis really is nt good movie nhave you ever rented movie and recieved sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation nwell any hope viewer may have had perhaps because he is fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed by the time he seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn ntheyre awful nthese commercials cover films like strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio nscott baio nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up nafter surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented watchers reborn maybe it wo nt be that bad he may say to himself perhaps just perhaps the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading nwatchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote decade ago nit stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy nlou rawls is even in the mix nunfortunately the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book nthe latter is really too bad nkoontz is hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer nkoontz has writing style which is succinct and suspenseful npeople who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices nits definately not koontz book if there is nt psychic superintelligent dog or psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs nwatchers has all three devices which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books nthe idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible is very interesting nbasically biological war machine is created smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the targets position psychically to large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat nsilly but kind of neat too nim sorry ni do nt mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn the movie ni suppose just do nt want to talk about the movie itself nthis turkey is really cheesy nno one in this movie can act including mark hamill and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero nthe cheese factor is only increased when he involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends nmercifully the filmmakers opted not to do nudity nto be honest the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein nyou know movie is bad when dog outacts all of its human counterparts ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie nand the creature nyes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in furry suit and mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling nthis creature is shot about times but its okay nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing noh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around ncheesy gore nthats another main element of watchers reborn nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense nultimately gave watchers reborn star and half because bad horror scifi film buffs may get few kicks out of the films silliness though this film will tax even their patience its an minute film but it feels like four hours nalso hate to admit have survived far worse than this nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what mean nfinally could nt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows mystery science theater nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with smile on my face nrated watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore nit also has violence obviously ni would nt recommend it for the little kids but sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay ninstead of watching this film however recommend reading koontzs book ntrust me it ll be time much much better spent
bive heard it called jaws with claws and that fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality ndirector stephen hopkins blown away predator and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build bridge to the th century ntheyve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music nthe movie does nt make lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boofest nin fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater the movie nhow about the three guys with rifles who trap lion and then ca nt even hit the damned thing nor the hamonwry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do nor my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops
bsenseless marlon wayans is very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life nalas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasycomedy above its onejoke premise ngranted that one joke is initially amusing nwhen wayanss darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes guinea pig for experimental drug that heightens all five senses nafter some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land position at highly esteemed corporate firm nat this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving himyessenseless nthis sets up some showcase moments for wayanss gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp nbut these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale nonce darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness nwayans approaches each goround with gusto but by this point he simply treading water for the rest of the films unfunny duration nsenseless would not be as problematic as it is if it did nt strive to be anything more than comic trifle nhowever the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in blanket of bogus sincerity ndarryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cashstrapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie nunlike wayanss last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing nany attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzlesdarryls romance with janice tamara taylor young woman who yearns for man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind nonce his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has promising bigscreen future ahead of him nbut if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his oncepromising older brother damon who is now set to make his comebackon television
bthe plot of big mommas house is martin lawrence in fat suit and dress nthats not just the highconcept premise its the fullyrealized allencompassing plot nsuch an emphasis is not unheardof in the world of hollywood summer entertainment none need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the highconcept plot idea better be pretty wellrealized or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer because you can bet there will be nothing else worth second of your time not developed character not provocative theme not witty twist nyou will get plus minutes of martin lawrence in fat suit and dress nothing more nothing less nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have shot at enjoying the onenote dud that is big mommas house nothers will simply stare mouth agape at its sheer unapologetic laziness nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner an undercover expert on stakeout assignment with his partner john paul giamatti ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco terrence howard has escaped from prison and the feds think he headed for his former girlfriend and presumedbutneverproved accomplice sherry nia long nsherry however has fled with her son trent jascha washington possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ella mitchell better known as big momma nindeed sherry appears to be on her way but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows nbig mommas houses bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs ndoubtfire director raja gosnell edited that film and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom but there just as strong whiff of tootsie in the main characters attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to woman nunfortunately big mommas house makes ridiculous decision neither of those other films made instead of having the protagonist pose as completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses it places malcolm in the position of playing friend and family member to several other characters nsuspension of disbelief in big mommas house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind andor stupid since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other nof course laughs trumps logic every time and big mommas house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as foultempered beast while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry nunfortunately no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another very different real person so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags malcolm reacting violently to big mommas explosive diarrhea attack malcolmasmomma schooling pair of cocky teens in basketball malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments malcolm delivering baby because big momma is the town midwife one of the few sequences that works nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times but there no reason to care whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character nhes just big momma without the makeup on ni wo nt waste time commenting on how ineptly the setup of the escaped convict is employed since it was clearly waste of time to the filmmakers nthere are few token scenes of lester looming as threatening figure but he ultimately distraction in film that really about its central visual incongruity and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia longs posterior nim never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing but know that when filmmaker tries to throw concept at me and pretend that its an entire film duck out of the way nthe gross implausibility of big mommas house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big cleverlyconstructed laughs nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant nbig mommas house is ridiculous and not funny nits just sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in fat suit and dress
bwell lets see nnot quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor nwell yeah can its not funny nok so laughed one time which warranted the star but other than that sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over which at running time of minutes seemed like forever nin fact this could be the unfunniest movie ve seen in long time if not the unfunniest nlet me be the first to say ready to rumble is huge disappointment nlong time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it to the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle nthat is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw nwell here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish to rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them while davids father wants him to become police officer and scott is loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots nwhat plot eh ready to rumble is one of those films that tries to be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the film is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer was nt funny nthe actors are dull the script awful and the plot which there is nt much of really nannoying nim not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such lame script and directed in such childish manner that wonder if hollywood is ever gon na make good films these days nthis review is nt going to be very long because of the fact that there is nt much going for the film if anything at all nonly one big laugh is in the film which is nt all that hilarious ni sat in my chair wondering with this nminute comedy was going to be over and sadly it went on forever nim not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such total waste but believe me you it is nreviewed by brandon herring for more reviews please visit movie review central at http www geocities commoviefanmoviereviewcentral html
bnumerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past scifi suspense thrillers nsoldier is multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground nbesides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography nrussell who is usually good actor in bgrade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like sergeant toad nbesides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombielike which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still long way from anything considered desirable
bthe sequel to the fugitive marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make few extra bucks ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive nthis time he after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course he been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes run for it gerard not so hot on his tail nwhat follows is about hours of action brought to us by the director of executive decision another film curiously involving plane nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive the prequel is far superior nbut even on its own marshals is pretty lousy movie nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent and had fugitive to root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time nwhile the fugitive gave little time to develop harrison fords character marshals is straight in there pulling its trump card the place crash almost immediately nto be honest could nt care less if snipes character got captured or not nsnipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons ill explain later ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly challenge nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming ni know its the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film ntheres few nudge nudge references from the first film but apart from that nothing nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife nnobody looks as if their having good time and all the performers are on autopilot nthe supporting cast are but when it comes to performances marshals falls flat on its face nit does nt fare any better plotwise either nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory nas said above the film is an normal average terrorist thriller seen million times before but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional nif this film was nt the sequel to the fugitive this would probably go straight to video or not even been made at all because its so average nand because of the films plot changing its course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie nstuart baird the director is all right but there no particular scene that stands out nits director is the usual action movie style neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension nthe special effects are nice especially the plane crash and there good if very loud soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith nbut in the end marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement nsure its loud and dumb but in the end marshals just ai nt fun nbored performers and lackluster plot and script do not make good action movie noverall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
bits hard not to recommend the others nthe supernatural thriller written and directed by alejandro amen bar open your eyes adroitly establishes and maintains lowkey atmosphere of menace nthe cinematography by javier aguirresarobe is as good as have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances nbut the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied noverall the film plays like very high quality version of any number of old twilight zone episodes where the characters spend great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented only to learn they are actually childs toy military test subject or department store dummy nwatching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter always wanted to shout get on with it nas much as appreciated the atmosphere and acting in the others my reaction was much the same nset at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii the story focuses on grace kidman who tends to her children anne alakina mann and nicholas james bentley and worries about her husband charles christopher eccleston missing serviceman nanne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all doors protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at time nat the beginning of the film three servants mrs mills fionnula flanagan young mute lydia elaine cassidy and mr tuttle eric sykes an aging gardener join the family nthe two that speak seem agreeable enough at first but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not nto make matters worse the children are upset nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts ngrace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them nthats essentially the whole story with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear nearlier there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog nthe visuals in the otherworldly sequence courtesy of aguirresarobe are simply astounding ni also enjoyed the presence of religion rarity in films dealing with the supernatural ngrace is christian and answers her childrens questions about life and death with the assurance of devout worshiper nwhen mother is away though the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore just as real children do nbut those nice touches fail to enliven film that is too slow or make up for lackluster ending the others sets out to be classic ghost story but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist
bthis review contains spoilers but believe me do nt say anything you ca nt guess minutes into the movie ni did go into this one with high expectations ni had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify departure from the slasher flicks ni sort of expected another exorcist or the shining ni even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film nboy was wrong nanother garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has story nthe story you ask nwell scumball buys chinese puzzle from guy in an arab souk nhe takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic nlo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks nwhen they re finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling nthey botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland did nt really recognize the organ under floorboard nthe guys brother and his brothers wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in nthey throw away scumballs belongings and set up house nturns out that wife is bit of nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage nshe starts having some wild hallucinations nlater hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slowmo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the groundall from the tiny cut on his hand nsaid blood is eagerly sucked up by scumballs organ nthe organ grows into thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into really ugly thing nit establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again nso she helps him kill three businessmen nscumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back nproblem is he does nt have any skin and even after three or four corpses still does nt get any skin nhe finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother nguess they could nt get the original actor back nwho knows nscumball whose name is frank is not nice guy nhe describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two nsomehow do nt see getting torn apart by fish and meathooks lot of fun nthis guy is so bad how bad is he so bad that the rats cower in corner in fear nfor good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves third while the nymphos horsing around with hubby nanyway hubbys daughter who if course is not wifes daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams nthe dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed nshe manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons nat any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing nthe story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake nthe demons are not however the good guys nthe dumb bimbos the good guy nshe somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion were not too sure which nnot too shabby for someone with singledigit iq nthis is basically bad jinn story nit is an awful movie nawful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is ncontinuity nwho cares nacting terrible nscript nhorrible nsounds canned nunrealistic nstory is soso but the impact is lost long long before the film ends ni do think the rat acting was quite good ni have never seen rats look afraid nthey should get nominated for an award nreally good acting there the best in the movie the envelope for best furry rodent please na rating would be far too generous na rating or in the to rating system is far more accurate nthis movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog ni can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show npeople were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen nhad to have something to do ndumb dumb dumb movie ni was embarrassed that spent money to see it nit goes without saying that disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself nlots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion

bi was pleasantly surprised by this film nwith budget topping million was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth centurys greatest tragedies would make film exciting enough to see nhow much could you dress up the sets nhow many models and computer effects could you use nhow much more action could you pack into ship that sinks noh if ve just given away part of the plot for you go back to school nafter having viewed titanic however found it to be wellpaced welldesigned and overall wellmade movie nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best ve seen ntitanic tells its story in two time periods nit starts out in the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic searching for priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship nwhat they find instead is drawing of woman wearing the necklace which is broadcast on the news nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team nin rose dewitt bukater kate winslett young lady belonging to societys upper class boards the titanic for the ships first atlantic crossing from southampton england to new york nshe is engaged to cal hockley billy zane an heir to old money and snob in every sense of the word non board rose feels the stifling trappings of highsocietys expectations and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanics stern but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio passenger in thirdclass steerage as its referred to who talks her out of jumping nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate love affair soon develops between the two which endangers roses social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal nthe story sounds very simple and perhaps even unexciting but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron good movie comes through ndicaprio is marvelous as the young but worldlywise jack playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors nhis is character that is immediately likable as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle variety of situations ngirls are going to swoon over him nwinslet also proves herself good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her characters upbringing nsimply by judgment of her gait was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an uppercrust debutante nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess she sometimes looks positively clumsy and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal since he has certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him nhis features are such that even when he smiles there something mistrustful about him and when he scowls he is evil incarnate nhes something like porcelain version of peter gallagher but cheaper model nlike dicaprio and winslet zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy cals personal assistant or man as they said at the turn of the century nno matter who else is in the cast you can always count on good performance by warner who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with gaze of steel and will to match nadditionally there are number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color such as kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown danny nucci as jacks friend fabrizio de rossi eric braeden as john jacob astor and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie nnice to see dr bombay getting work nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in film about the titanic but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ships crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else nin this way titanic possesses depth not usually found in action pictures nyou do nt just get love story with tragedy as backdrop but very real account of class struggle as well nas mentioned before the budget for this film was tremendous and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic nwith regard to the exteriors would dare anyone to point out film in which vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such scale ncameron actually built scale model of the titanic in water tank but only had room for and therefore had to computergenerate the remaining feet ncouldve fooled me and everyone else in the theater as the splicing is seamless nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship how the flooding occurred the way the ship sank and why it did so in that manner nthese technical details serve as guide for later on when the action starts happening and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion nin all james camerons titanic is good blend of love story history and action nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewers attention is held alternately by those three main elements from the movies intriguing beginning to its satisfactory ending nin box office receipts titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
ba welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings na prime example of this is things hate about you which was basically the taming of the shrew in high school nless successful was last years adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp here the setting was the corporate world of new york nnow comes faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeares tragedies nlike things hate about you the stage is high school private prep school where odin james mekhi phifer is the oncourt general the basketball teams standout player njulia stiles featured in things hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawkes hamlet plays desi brable odins girlfriend whose father also happens to be dean of the institution njosh hartnett pearl harbor is on hand for the villainy playing the scheming hugo who sets the tragic wheels in motion no was actually filmed couple of years ago but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy nthe movie directed by tim blake nelson best known for his costarring role in brother where art thou and written by brad kaaya is very grim nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits nand that is how it should be nof all of shakespeares tragedies othello is the most harrowing not because of any body count but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery nkaayas profanefilled script after all these are high school kids does offer hugo subtle motive of sorts nthe young man considers himself the basketball teams prime utility man who does little bit of everything pass shoot rebound but is constantly in the shadow of odin nplus his father the teams coach played with ferocious intensity by martin sheen showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desis fidelity eroding the stars confidence in those he considers closest to him affecting both his relationships and his game nit all ends in blood of course which is why the movie was originally shelved nthe performances in vary nphifer is at first cocky and selfassured emotions he handles with ease nhe also does quite well displaying odins darker side his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution his growing distrust of those he loved his rage and the erosion of his belief system nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit turning friend against friend and lover against lover nstiles seems bit stilted but occasionally also rises to the occasion moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight nthe film does contain few missteps subplot involving hugos theft of the school mascot is left hanging nalso desis actions concerning michael andrew keegan odins former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugos machinations is puzzling nwhy she would continually be seen with michael however innocent the circumstances when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back nit is irrational nbut these are minor carpings noverall is stylish and faithful adaptation nif nothing else it may encourage some people to read the original text and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature

bcapsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal nstarship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that nit is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun its so cynically calculatedly boneheaded that even the least demanding members of the audience was with were alternately bored and revulsed nits one of the worst movies ve seen in long time nwhy am calling this movie pornography npornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts ni remember reading review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as nearpornographic eternity ni did nt agree with that assessment but could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers nits literally like giant recruitment film that has gone berserk nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening nthe film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that does nt appear to have intelligence nto counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which they re clearly capable of they send down grunts with rifles nthis is nt heinlein its bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene has journalist on battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic nthey do not possess germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense nthey do nt even behave like soldiers in bad movie and therefore we do nt care about them nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate nhere we do nt even hate the bugs what there to hate nhating them would be like cursing hurricaine nif there anything really hateful there the movie does nt know how to give it to us nthe screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talentimpaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other none of the subplots concerns woman pilot who great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again nonce or twice is fine nby the fifth or sixth time its worn out its welcome ntheres never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle nalso the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry nif bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing damned thing nbut if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip nuhhuh nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasifascist flavor ni say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie does nt have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject nthe bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison nlike the rest of the movie ntheres more suppose but its not worth it nthe acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like masterpiece
return to horror high wants to be couple different types of movies at once nthe film tells the story of lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high school where group of serial murders took place five years before nbut what the cast and crew do nt know is that real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again non one level return to horror high is slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on nwatching the film which was made in could nt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream non another level the film wants to be slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout nunfortunately most of these jokes fall flat nand the last thing the film wants to be is behindthescenes look at an exploitation film being made nthe only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be nand to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time nthere are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive winnebago through nif you see the film or have seen it you ll know what mean nthe premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place nbut director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene nwell come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in room as the killer tries to break in nbut other than that twominute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake nnote look for george clooney in supporting role as one of the actors on the film nand strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally
bthere is striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise nthe camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up nyou see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they can not feel human touch nit is an important scene for several reasons nfirst of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference nthere are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield or michael nthe angels here are stark and believable nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human can not and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well nthey eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven nlike human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially love story between seth and human beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven nmaggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but its not enough nhe wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at distance nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human nhe learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz nblue in touching and humorous performance nsitting at diner together franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another persons skin smell the air and most importantly have loving wife and children nof course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting film wings of desire nwenders film was more like poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human nand unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare it does nt suffer extensive damage nthis may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it nand yet city of angels is not typical hollywood movie nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world nseale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is wonderful sequence in circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by nwhile the film travels along charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are nboth cage and ryan give soulful softspoken performances nryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies sadness that can only be alleviated by heavenly touch ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have nwhat is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging nits not formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time nit does nt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of romance ninstead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive visit charlie do nt surf nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http www bigfoot comjimkendrick email jimkendrickbigfoot com
bin december of little movie called scream was released became boxoffice smash and resurrected films targeted at teens nfirst it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre la john hughes starting with last junes ca nt hardly wait nit may be the first week of april in but so far this year we have been given movie aimed at the andunder market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie and the mod squad ncoming april are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april we ve got the teen satire election and the teen horrorcomedy idle hands njeesh nout of all of these moves however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation things hate about you is this past januarys mediocre hohum she all that nalthough similar in plotting ok darn near identical things hate about you modernday version of shakespeares the taming of the shrew she all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by firsttime feature director gil junger to the charming and wellwritten screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in teen comedy since the breakfast club nand to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we did nt have to once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she all that nthe day wideeyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordonlevitt starts school at seattlebased padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik nalthough he does nt know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller wo nt allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles senior decides to nkat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger ncomplicating matters camerons dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey nas you can see things hate about you includes huge number of characters some of which have nt even mentioned such as kats shakespeareobsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and biancas materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union nat short but wellused running time of minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you re vapor nsince could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained naside from good screenplay its the performances that can make or break movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot naside from joseph gordonlevitt rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that wellknown but it is this aspect that brings particular freshness to the proceedings nas the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the is marvelous and always believable and certainly has bright future ahead of her neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged it was easy to identify with kats way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality nno one think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does nheath ledger as the infamous badboy of the town injects much life into patrick and has lot of chemistry with stiles none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into person with multidimensions even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset nin one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has none offbeat element of the film and source of some hearty laughs is the way that the schools staff act which is strikingly unformal nallison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good nalthough there are few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters nin one very funny scene chastity asks know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed nat another point bianca and kats father standout larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what its like to be pregnant things hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the nit also helps that the movie has perfectlyassembled soundtrack mixing indierock with new wave songs and with thank goodness no rap nby the films end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from nluckily doubt would be able to find ten things hate about things hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far outnumber ten
buncompromising french director robert bressons lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malorys morte darthur ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as weak ineffectual leader and the knights as group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them nchivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of dying ideal nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlins command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled with christs blood nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure nthe opening sequence is series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights head is hacked off stomach is impaled skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of flaming house nsince the film starts with camelot in nearruin and takes only an hour and half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion it does nt carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall to witness nbut then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film nrather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of kingdom nlancelot has always been tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh nthe greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthurs wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion nwhen sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelots defense nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of mens hearts and minds lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademarks strippeddown minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and grand use of natural sounds in place of music nhe uses background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits nthe music here is heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the films thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest nlike most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices nall the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on given word ninstead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through images nin some ways this technique works in other ways it does nt nthe final montage of arthurs men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to literal scrappile sums up the entire film in one moment nhowever other times bressons uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable nfor instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs nhe does this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few notes from bagpipe and the raising of different flag nwhile there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nnevertheless lancelot of the lake is fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by master filmmaker nbressons style may not be for everyone but one has to respect his strength as an artist nby reevaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema truly personal film
ba movie laced with good blend of action comedy and heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating dismal and unsatisfactory product neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm ndan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his cowriting credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on selfproclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago nas we begin elwood is being released from state penitentiary along with the news of his brothers death in prison years ago ncompletely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away nbut elwood is nt completely without family nit seems he has halfbrother of sorts not real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudofather curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band nworking as police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mothers affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster nevan bonifant who quickly learns to become minielwood nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock nmeanwhile cabs personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his nexttonextofkin nfrom this point the movie turns into series of music videos with few bits of acting in between nthose hoping for an interesting andor funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of story nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours nfor those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors nblues brothers is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie nmany many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you do nt have passion for very deep bluesrock you ll be bored out of your skull nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience nand seeing three guys in threepiece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long nunfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film
bit was rainy friday afternoon in columbus when persuaded friend to see matinee performance of mstk tm nhe had never seen any episodes of the show and have watched scant few due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes nfor those of you not familiar with the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public nto achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme which is missing in the movie bumped mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow robot nthe format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on which our heroes are marooned nonly two things are different in the movie the absence of forresters sidekick tvs frank and the slower pace of the jokes nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke nfor their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth classic and one of the first sf films to have special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill nunfortunately for that film but making it ideal mstk fodder acting and dialogue appear to have taken back seat to the effects which by todays standards are less than impressive nnelson co make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market to star trek to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome and most of them work nunfortunately the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and are nt particularly funny but at least they re fairly short nthe big question about this movie though is why ni presume it was an attempt to gain larger following to keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen there are no special effects to dazzle you no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound nso it seems pointless to spend per person to see this movie when in few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for and not have to sit in room full of popcorn addicts nnevertheless mstk tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film you re going to see this year and thoroughly recommend it to anyone with pulse ngiven its uniqueness hesitate to grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies it does well
bof the major horror subgenres vampire movies are easily the most adaptable nthink about it nfrankenstein movies have nt changed all that much because they still need that madscientistinbavariancastle setting nif you made frankenstein movie today you have to have the monster be virus or something and outside of michael fox there are nt any actors that could play virus convincingly nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt ntheres not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris unless you want to have teenage werewolf or something and there that michael fox thing again nbut you can have vampires do anything and you can place them in any genre you want just about nyou can have traditional vampire movies bram stokers dracula or have the anne rice version interview with the vampire or play it for laughs vampire in brooklyn nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california the lost boys to squalid mexican dives from dusk till dawn to your local high school buffy the vampire slayer nwere it not redundant you could have movie about law firm full of vampires nany day now expect well see movie about vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play day game in order to break the home run record nor you can insert the vampire legend into hong kong action movie and when you do that you get blade nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie the silent expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path nin this case the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead bleeding corpses nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in marshals but does demonstrably better job here as halfvampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers nblade is silent brooding presence laying waste to vampires without shred of remorse nhe is as cold as his silverbladed sword as single minded as his garlicfilled bullets nyet he not without quirks blade drives battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent nlike any good hong kong movie blade is heavy on the chopsocky action nfor some reason blade spends lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional antivampire weapons of garlic and silver blade dismisses manportable arc lamp as being too heavy although it looks to be more efficient tool to dispatch vampires nunfortunately the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers which it most strongly resembles nthe replacement killers is the last movie saw that did nt review mostly because it made no impression on me and could nt remember anything other than noise violence and the intensity of fats performance nblade has little more going for it and has the vampire myth to draw from but other than that its the same kind of movie exciting with well choreographed action scenes but with no resonance nwith stronger villain stephen dorff is pardon the pun curiously bloodless as the head vampire leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role wittier script and strong supporting cast blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment nas it is blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying

bjohn boormans zardoz is goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on bizarre enjoyment quality all its own nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward wood jr has movie been so silly and so serious at the same time nof course woods career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent nboorman on the other hand can not court such excuses to explain zardoz or his followup film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic nboorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you would nt know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly overconceived arthurian epic excalibur and the fatherson jungle adventure the emerald forest nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste nif boorman is anything he ambitious and when he succeeds its in grand fashion nunfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boormans nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz book which figures into the movies plot nbut despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling nthe events take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness to be found nin fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting oldstyle guns and living in large victorian mansions nits more middle ages than space age nthe world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life nthese immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society nhowever if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years nif someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in geriatric home with others aged criminals none of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed nlike the wizard of oz he adopts godlike status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movies opening images and its dead giveaway of the lunacy to come ncalling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch of outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they ca nt procreate and take up more resources nfrom inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like the gun is good nthe penis is evil nthat line alone is worth the movies cult following none day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardozs flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex nonce there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is mystery to them nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up ni say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although have hard time believing that as production moved forward he did nt get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in red loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache and pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on cheap hollywood hooker nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason can imagine studio would greenlight this effort nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor nsean connery had made his last james bond film in and perhaps he was looking for change in pace nhe got exactly that in zardoz and its wonder it did nt end his career nim sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements nis it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life nis it condemnation of those who consider growing old to be bad thing nor is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary ncome to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than completely unintentional comedy
bi guess its credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour could not be ruined even by the nauseating comedy of chris tucker nim fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well nit would have worked better if he was the only name above the title nthe plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects nthis time around the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan john lone who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states still not sure how you can make fortune doing that is there place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones nthe only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns nof course its up to hong kong detective lee chan and trashtalking lapd detective james carter tucker to take the bad guys out and the authorities to the extent that they even exist stay out of their way nrush hour turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out ni guarantee that my rating would have been at least half of grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan nhe refuses to shut up nnot only did his voice feel like jackhammer on my head but his jokes just are nt funny pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny ni realize that in movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates but did nt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was nif this is all the comedian has to offer then do nt care to see any more of his films nfortunately chan makes for marvelous straight man and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely nits not often that one actor can so completely save movie but there is no other name for what he does whenever he on screen rush hour comes to nearly breathtaking often hilarious life nmuch of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be player but who cares ni can think of few high concepts that are funnier nthe movie ends with outtakes that as usual show that chan is nt perfect and that it does indeed take him few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless nchris tucker botches some lines as well and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie na lot of people have pointed out rush hour is nt very different from its predecessor in tone or style nbut liked the original and like the sequel though certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it ndirector brett ratner the family man keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes guess sometimes the shotgun approach works nits not great jackie chan but its jackie chan and that enough nup next jay and silent bob strike back

bthe characters in jonathan lynns the whole nine yards yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies analyze this and mickey blue eyes gun shy are rarely ever written as real people but merely as onedimensional caricatures nwhen an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed it is not to service the character development or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but to accommodate the convoluted plot nin lightweight comedy you might say it is not required to have perfectly realized figures just as long as they get the job done nunfortunately for comedy to work it has to at least succeed at being funny and if there was laughometer available guess that it briefly ascended around of the time for me nsuffice to say the comedy in the whole nine yards works about as well as the brokendown lawnmower in my backyard and when giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes it is by sheer luck nnicholas oz oseransky matthew perry is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec ntrapped in hateful marriage with the conniving sophie rosanna arquette delightfully hamming it up with clearly artificial frenchcanadian accent one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house nextdoor nwalking over to greet him he is horrified to discover it is jimmy the tulip tudeski bruce willis former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison nonce getting to know him and becoming his friend oz is more comfortable with his identity but for sophie it means possible hitman to do away with oz nin her scheme sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss kevin pollak about jimmys whereabouts but in the process he falls in love with jimmys wife cynthia natasha henstridge who is being held hostage nupon return to quebec and with one contrivance after the next ozs dental assistant jill amanda peet is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside the tulip and forces him to set up meeting since jills dream in life turns out being contract killer herself nhave you got all that nbecause there is more nmuch much more nand this is movie that without credits is little over minutes and feels only like an hour the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set by far superior pictures nhow the cast most of which are respectable actors got caught up in such cliched deficient film remains mystery unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns comedy classic clue the movie ngoing into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but by the twentyminute mark when had chuckled once and laughed nary single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner collapses with every failing comedy bit the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness to become professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark na few select actors do what they can with the material while others make no impact at all non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis nperry innocuously enjoyable on tvs friends plays the same exact sitcomstyle character in all of his movies from fools rush in to three to tango and it has become crushing bore nmeanwhile willis makes next to no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better nbest of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia nhenstridge has the talent for sure to break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent namanda peet has lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on career based solely on comedy nit is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in climactic scene with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts nfinally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs nwhen the whole nine yards eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such film ever got greenlit na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but duplication of better films so what was the point nwithout passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all nnow what does that tell you
bits difficult to expect much from director whose greatest accomplishments to date are handful of awardwinning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes nthat said hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic nbut occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary nthose moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective hyper religious reaganloving mother ngyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story jimmy is bubble boy kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with single germ plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld nhis mom homeschools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages until he befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door njimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for kiss nbut when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds bubble suit and embarks on hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love nthe offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including screaming chinese strip club owner and devout east indian hindi nbut even if you find stereotype humor funny its hard to muster more than giggle for these shallow gags nthey even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with group of carnival freaks nbut few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and wacky sendup of cult called bright shiny led by the inimitable fabio nunfortunately few giggles ca nt make bubble boy the riotous offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be nhonestly its mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and not just saying that because its so mediocre nhow odd for disney to take gamble on film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that does nt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many nand now that the studio is suffering through very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disneys wondering the same thing nhope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
bthere is scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on group of stoic doctors nwhen noticed that the audience with whom saw this film was reacting the same way realized that was going to have hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture nyou see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries ni hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories ni hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying nits confounding ni ca nt believe film can be this bad nand yet its based on real man who probably has good point to make nin the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human nin the beginning of the film patch commits himself to mental institution because he does nt want to kill himself nwhile there he notices that the doctors do nt care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings nso patch goes on crusade to be great doctor who actually talks to his patients nhe goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that its good to help people nhe also meets carin fischer monica potters the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be successful doctor nnaturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams nso patch decides that he going to build free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have nand that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of non superficial level the film is not particularly bad would nt say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potters performance even if she is wasted nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution nevery scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard ntake for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on bus nwe do nt know patch yet but there sad music and its supposed to make us really sad that he sad nlater on patch makes lot of progress he helps dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively nand when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions nreal drama is characterbased nyou grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it nwe do nt ever grow to know the dying patient he simply vehicle for patchs greatness nreal drama does nt seem forced or present just to make the audience cry nthats why patch adams is not real drama nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score nsentimentality like this is indeed bad nbut its not as bad as halfbaked simplistic themes nyou see patch is really great student nhe aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he cheating nbut patch does nt think that memorizing facts is the way to become good doctor why do nt we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds nwell patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort nmost of us have to study nand doctor who really wants to help but does nt know toe from finger probably wo nt be too successful in preventing death noh wait almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life nyes nthat is true nand you can not do that without studying nyou can not do that without going to medical school nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea to study first and talk to patients later nfollow the rules nbah nwho needs the rules nonly uptight doctors follow the rules nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants nand then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic na free clinic nin the middle of the forest nwhere patients can be taken to be helped nfor free nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic nwill it have an emergency room nor is it just for mental patients nand who may ask will pay for it nthe film does give some token attempts to question patchs motives think another character asks him how he going to pay for it in addition to little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly do nt explore or challenge patchs ideas to any meaningful extent nreader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams ni know nothing about him nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character then might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony nand in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does lot of shouting nactually robin williams does lot of shouting nhe shouts lot about helping people and lot of people cry because they are moved by his words ni wo nt tell you that you ca nt be moved by his words because too was moved by his words ni was moved in such profoundly negative way that was reminded of how cheap and phony cinematic experience can be npatch adams is the cheapest of them all
bsusan grangers review of hearts in atlantis castle rockwarner bros ntiming is everything and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the comingofage nostalgia of stand by me with the mystical power of the green mile nbased on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks its set in in harwich connecticut where fatherless yearold bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in boarding house with his resentful selfcentered mother hope davis nhes devoted to his neighborhood friends mika boorem will rothhaar but his pivotal relationship is with strange new tenant ted brautigan anthony hopkins who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him birthday gift and hands him instead library card nknowing he longing for schwinn bike ted offers to pay him week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers nthe story structure consists of one long flashback framed by the present featuring the adult bobby david morse minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel sensitive and benignly seductive nthe only explanation is that he psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate given the inexplicable state of the world right now nthe production values and performances are solid particularly hopkins arguably the finest most versatile actor of our era and the children with whom he forges firm bond non the granger movie gauge of to hearts in atlantis is wistful enigmatic evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis
bdont let the following quirks of this review fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love nbut one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that nlife is beautiful even though short ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh nlife is beautiful even though have nt amounted to much in life except working out the finer intricacies of waitering nim lucky sort of guy especially when beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find new age sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath life is beautiful nim jew but life can still be beautiful nthe nazis put me in concentration camp but life is still beautiful ni love my son very much and that what matters and that what makes life beautiful nmy ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ni get shot for my efforts and the woman love but hey that life and that still beautiful thing so by jove do nt give me any crap about it nby far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved nwell done there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni
bthe generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film well see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever film nits confusing to critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction nthat however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller nthe punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has brain in its head even as the remaining of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner brash investigator for the armys criminal investigation division nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at georgia base the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press which gives brenner only the hours before the fbi steps in nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had romantic relationship with brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid nif only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze ndirector simon west likely thinks he covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches which is the films fatal flaw nits trend he continues for two hours taking the storys few virtues and slapping coat of moronproof obviousness over them ncharacters who may wink wink turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans nwest just ca nt help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter nhe even turns scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbells mentor psychological warfare expert named moore james woods ntheres something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another nindeed travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures to the local sheriff of the georgia county should nt you be out nightsticking the colored folk neven the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides few winning zingers ngoldmans dialogue can serve up bigger laugh than you ll find in most socalled comedies ndialogue unfortunately just is nt enough to make quality script nits difficult to take movie about criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it to last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye nby the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought psychointherain finale wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun nits silly and pretentious filmmaking but at least it provides giggle or five ngoldman should tear the decent pages out of this script and turn them into standup routine
bthe idea at the center of the devils advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is trickster satan is humanist the last humanist nhe appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin nal pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya piece inside wisdom on god have million names as john milton the devil nthe main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliams the time bandits nbut the film is something else something original npart of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but does nt try to become any profound study of power nthis is marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking nit is also entertaining nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the minds eye nthe final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coens fargo nthe central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows nits nice to know that things like this are still being made
bthere are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason good will hunting is about one of those people nthe will hunting of the horrible title lets face it this film would be bitch to title played by cowriter matt damon is mathematical genius nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew cup of irish cream cappuccino nand he works at mit as the janitor none day the professor of one of the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves stellan skarsg rd puts big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete nthe next day its already done on the board but no one in his class claims to have done it nso lambeau puts another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove nand duh its done again nof course they catch the guy who did it red handed will nbefore lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will has gotten into fight with bunch of punks on basketball court and struck police officer so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements he work with him on math and he get some therapy nafter going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another for hypnotist he fakes being under his spell then launches into an impromptu performance of the classic afternoon delight nfinally lambeaus old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams psych professor agrees to treat him and the two begin rocky relationship as sean tries to get will to open up nturns out will had rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster homes and what not nit also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life he wants challenge nand that is to hang out with his buds including the other cowriter ben affleck and do honorable jobs like construction nis it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky nshould this guy be forced to do something he does nt want to do nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film which is jampacked with greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should nim not saying good will hunting is bad film at all nits very enjoyable film with tons of great moments and lots of great things about it nthe acting is amazing with two oscarnominationworthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays wills love interest skylar nthere are tons of individual moments that adored ni loved all the comedy in the film especially scene where damon proves schmuck out of college student who is quoting historian to impress some chicks his various attempts at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire film the one where he delivers long exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them ni liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal that felt rightfully uncomfortable nlike the breakup scene between will and skylar will and seans first meeting bar scene between sean and lambeau and scene where sean tells in detail how he does nt regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter nhowever the main flaw of the film is there too much of everything and not enough of it either nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten ntake for example the relationship between sean and will the film gets an interesting fatherson as well as doctorpatient relationship going with out any problems but when it tries to show them as equals it falls on its face nwe hear how they went to the same town and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do nalso wills relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck has nice climax but not enough rising action nwe see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at decision between the two of them it seems more like superficial reasoning than more selected one ntheir relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems to be generalization of any two best friends instead of something more human nmaybe it was just me nand it also goes for parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten nand of course as in most films like this the girlboy relationship is pretty underwritten nwe never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she loves him it seems more like its there for plot details that anything else nminnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character nthe writing is bit at fault here but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness nsure it feels overstuffed but its extremely enjoyable nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human ni think that they should get nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue which is amazing nwhile this is probably director gus van sants most conservative film you hardly know its the same director of to die for the only van sant film ve seen really its still pretty remarkable film albeit tad overrated what this best picture deal nand if film puts smile on my face despite posessing lot of flaws have no problem with reccomending it to anyone
bplot token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film trio from the studio after they complete the final cut without him nhe threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision ncritique wow ni really ca nt remember the last time movie sucked on so many levels nthe comedy in this film is pathetic obvious and dated oj simpson jokes galore nthe plot is uninteresting boring and bad nthe structure of the film is annoying repetitive and pretentious nthe acting is pretty bad especially jackie chan who ca nt act to save his life nthe cameos are lame and seem forced and the ending blows chunks nall in all this movie believes itself to be clever humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood but comes across as boring stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite ni love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans but this one bites the big one nsee it if you like to watch really bad movies otherwise skip it because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it nluckily for us all this mess only lasts about minutes and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays leadfaced detective nby the way is there any reason why the studio or the producer could nt have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over nwho knows who cares this satire sucks the bag nlittle known facts about this film and its stars ironically the original director of this film arthur hiller also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dgas alan smithee moniker nthis was after the films production company cinergi pictures preferred the cut made by producerwriter joe eszterhas to his nthe original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis neszterhas announced through the media during postproduction that cinergi pictures did nt have the money to pay for soundtrack nhe said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him nhe received cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists listened to all that was sent at least couple of tracks from each record and compiled the soundtrack nthis film practically swept the razzie awards in given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year with no less than the worst picture award the worst screenplay joe eszterhas the worst supporting actor joe eszterhas the worst new star joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer and the worst original song wanna be mike ovitz nas written by joe eszterhas
bis evil dead ii bad movie nits full of terrible acting pointless violence and plot holes yet it remains cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots including the original evil dead is extremely difficult nwell what it about nfive people stranded in log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from variety of ugly hairy wart covered monsters ncome on saw movie just like that on monster vision last week nwhy should see it again nno evil dead ii is different its funny nits funny to see people die nare you sick or something nmaybe am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of movie nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle as disturbing as it is hilarious nan example of raimis odd approach monster formerly protagonist ashs girlfriend of all people is cut in half by chainsaw and tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound nsure its overthetop but it is so overthetop that it is laugh out loud funny just try watching ash with straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood staining his face and knocking him back few feet nthe whole movie is like this watch ash get beat up watch ash defeat the monster watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets the more amusing it becomes nno matter how sick it may sound it is funny to watch bruce ampbells ash get his butt kicked every five minutes nand raimi takes advantage he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend by the body of an old lady even by his own right hand nlike the less superior idle hands we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part nbut it does nt end ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family nall of these events thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster like camera movements at first become shocking then inexplicably funny nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers duck soup then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off nwith running time of less than an hour and half raimi gets away with the impossible making horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series raimi obviously had lot of fun making this movie and could nt wait to make its sequel

americas sweethearts has an intriguing premise and great cast but it is nt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to coscript writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of selfindulgence ncrystal ignores simple but crucial rule for screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous americas sweethearts takes place at press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters nits promising setup but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation nby the end of the film all the lead performers participate in huge fight with room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed njohn cusack and catherine zetajones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the million mark but the prospects for their final effort space opus titled time over time are far from rosy nwhile eddie has spent many months in new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwens solo films have tanked nto make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken visionary who purchased the unabombers cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket ndesperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal recently fired publicist to salvage the situation nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation nhe enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwens sister personal assistant and whipping girl nwhat lee does nt know is that kiki is in love with eddie fact that could temper her effectiveness npress junkets are haven for control freaks nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in plush hotel with food and drink always at hand ngenerally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel nthe next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews nevery minutes or so producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for few minutes of questions with publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes question they may not be invited to future junkets nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges nthe reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs nplacing two spoiled actors in setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit nthe junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to plush resort near las vegas nfor most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press nwhen they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is declawed ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions nlee certainly is nt bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors nhell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie nall of which underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in americas sweethearts is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it does nt matter because any publicity is good publicity nand thus the very setup for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter nso what about the cast njulia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in fat suit and not very convincing one by the way ncatherine zetajones makes believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic nby casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks nin supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad nseth green is amusing as toadie stanley tucci is very good as ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with ncome to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie nas hollywood satire americas sweethearts is toothless nas romance it is at best minor pleasure nsuch good cast such waste of their efforts nhad it not been taken long ago better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing
bfunny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways nthe ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters get new jobs nwas one line if remember correctly nat the end of the th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is jerk and now two maneating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off npatterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas hunter of world reknown or something like that nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and costarred with siegfried and roy nthey are nighinvulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature ngive me break nthe movie has nt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic nget this remingtons big plan is to build large scaffoldlike structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up nhe does this and then gets knocked off by bird nby the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand nthe acting is forgettable ndouglas does good job of portraying relatively cracked fellow but its nothing he has nt done before nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography nthe camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent nwhat did expect from this movie ni dunno nsome real excitement suppose na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation nno such luck ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind

bone way of telling if film is good or not is by the length nif film is only minutes but feels like minutes then its crap nbut if film last hours and feels like minutes then its excellent nboogie nights falls into the latter catagory nthe director anderson delivers funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along nmark whalberg nmarky mark plays eddie adams seventeen year old with certain gift in the midriff area njack horner reynolds is adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business nafter running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies nin the movie business dirk meets whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script nwe learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband nbut the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing nthe direction is fast thrilling and never holds up nthere are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches nthe writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park or tommorow never dies nboogie nights really is spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantinos films resevoir dogs and pulp fiction nthe soundtrack is also excellent nlike american graffiti the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift nalso the costumes are great nthe clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties nthe film although excellent does have some flaws nfirstly wahlberg although excellent can not do highly scenes which require him to be angry nin both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost nbut the rest of the cast are excellent nburt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william macy is great aswell but he always is nanother flaw with the film though is that the ending seems bit tacked on nit seems anderson saw the film was going on bit and needed to wrap up quickly nits shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced nbut they re small niggles really nboogie nights is an excellent film nsuperb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film nwhatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights
the th warrior comes at the end of as summer where we ve already experienced man eating sharks deep blue sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even man hunting witch the blair witch project nnow the th warrior presents tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears nthe story if that what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his kings wife and is banished from his home land nhe then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them neventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men nthirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth nhes not warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances hell have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield nthats basically the entire plot nthere is also romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers did nt just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story ninstead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer nthe film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop story it becomes laughing stock nthe battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting nwe do nt get to know any of the characters and so we do nt care who lives and who dies nthe film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as failed actionadventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels nit was directed by john mctiernan who the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently nand its not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for time to dump it on audiences nit belongs back on the shelf
bthe word rest in the title should be stressed since this is movie that lacks any action scenes at all nwhat does takes place is more based on character development nthe film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid nwhat they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nnick and beth have relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana and who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different ncarol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend sid is jointsmoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in nobviously based on stage play the problem with the movie is that there lot of things left out nits not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job is nt mentioned nand why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain mystery when he has nt seen them for many years nset in small fictional ntown in arizona was good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings nthe name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in house discussing life and the future nparticularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her nnot an actress that have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but ill keep an eye on her in the future ninteresting trivia this was rated in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it

bwhile watching shallow grave found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens blood simple nboth are good films in which several characters none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes nthe body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands nboth films are also flawed but for different reasons blood simple is unrelentingly dark and moody but its characterizations were little hollow shallow grave on the other hand is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they accomplished for more standard audiencepleasing ending nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that honestly felt quite troubled by what was witnessing on screen most of the time yet there was slight grin on my face at the end nas the film begins we are introduced to alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox and david christopher eccleston scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious but other than that they seem like fairly normal bunch na man named hugo moves into the apartments remaining vacancy and the next morning he is found dead of drug overdose njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him suitcase filled to the brim with cash presumably from criminal activities nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death after drawing of straws the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film and part of what makes shallow grave so brilliant for while is that honestly had no idea what was coming next nother than the obvious question of why they do nt report the death and simply hide the cash which is not addressed the plotting and characterization while sometimes predictable worked in way that kept my attention and on more than one occasion gave me chills ni will therefore attempt to continue this review in way that does nt give away too much of the plot nbroadly the trio are in danger due to hugos underworld connections as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process na police inspector ken stott is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with junior detective ndavid meanwhile becomes increasingly paranoid moves into the attic and develops an affinity for sharp objects ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other nwhile do not consider myself the happy endings are automatically stupid type thought that shallow grave really should have ended in tragedy realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison in the mental hospital or in the morgue nthis could have been accomplished quite credibly but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for more conventional caper ending in which we get kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom and nothing more ngranted this is nt really happy ending but its still pretty lighthearted compared to what preceded it ni really should nt say anything more about the ending as far as details go but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable nyes this ending made me crack smile for couple of minutes but ultimately it left me feeling as if been cheated nstill shallow grave was brilliant most of the way through and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller and am therefore awarding it three stars ni guess just ca nt help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away

bif were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films might say that review movies that do nt look particularly good because doing service to my readers by warning them against seeing it nif that were true could put banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you do nt have to nbut know that bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what say nso have to tell the truth every once in while get nasty masochistic urge to see bad movie nyou know the feeling when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have ball trashing mercilessly nsometimes think that why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever nadmit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies nso do nso saw supernova ntruth be told supernova was nt quite as bad as thought it might be nmaybe just felt sorry for the actors or maybe thought it could have been decent if the studio had nt started tinkering with the directors walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed nmaybe becoming softy nin any case did nt find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe nbut its still bad nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale nthe crew includes captain nmarley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz nthere are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has shady past involving drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female ndont expect any more explanation because you wo nt get it nanyway the crew gets distress call from location deep in space to which failed mining operation had been sent nduring the dimension jump think that what its called but do nt hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board nhe calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of man kaela once had relationship with nthen bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening nhave you seen alien nhave you seen event horizon lame movie in its own right ngood nthen you ve seen supernova npostproduction cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either nafter all no ones going to think for second that troy wo nt turn out to be villain nbut the bigger problem with supernova is that it can just stick to the simple plot its afforded nnumerous rewrites the script may be credited to three people but its gross underestimate have crammed this lean minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped nwas there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot ndid the ships computer learn something about humanity nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him nand just what does the films title signify if anything nas far as can tell it refers to very small plot detail that is nt developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense nfor some reason every person in this film keeps having sex nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first minutes nbassett and spaders characters start off hating each other nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they re engaging in some hankypanky nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut nthe most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits nfurthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits nmaybe that why the films title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of scene with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point to point point danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby npoint tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing ndoesnt make sense nsince did nt understand anything about these characters motivations did care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone and he does knocking off three of them in about minutes nnot whit nits shame because this cast contains lot of talented actors looking for something to do nthey do nt find it nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces nsexual tension nmore like constipation nmaybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and whole lot less nice nnot that we ever find out who that is mind you nthe climax of their relationship taking place in transport pod is probably the films biggest foreheadslapper nas troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected nhe awfully onenote but its not as if he given any more notes to work with nthe rest of the cast does even less ntunney stands around looking cute then scared nphillips broods ncruz flirts with the computer nthen they all die and star blows up or something but really was nt paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but cutting it little slack merely because expected less than what got nthats it nif you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have you ll probably hate it more than will neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice to say the script is nt going to save the film nhonestly though what do you expect from film with about dozen writers and director who had his name removed and replaced with pseudonym nit usually results in bad movie and that what supernova is
bdefending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writerdirector albert brooks who also stars in the comedy nafter dying in car crash on his birthday of all days brooks wakes up in judgement city satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings nbrooks has five days to convince two judges that he worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence nenter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant nduring his trial brooks must view episodes of his life on movie screen and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant nits impossible to resist chuckling and cringing at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth ntorn in particular is in vintage comic form and he walks away with the picture nthe movie also features meryl streep appealing as the loveinterest and shirley maclaine who pops up in hilarious cameo nwhile the film is uneven many of its gags are price less ntake for example the food in judgement city its always the most delicious you ve ever tasted nand its also caloriefreeso chow down
bnot since shine which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott has movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of worldclass musicians nin fact if one were to watch these films together it would almost certainly stand as convincing argument that life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills nyet hilary and jackie the sophomore effort from director anand tucker has something more to say it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in very compelling tale nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale playing the sisters du pr nboth musicians from childhood hilary griffiths is renowned flutist while jacqueline watson is easily as skilled on the cello nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women both together and seperate ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one anothers and although their lives take very different paths hilary settles down to marriage and family while rachel skips across the globe on world concert tour they are bound together by their deep family love nthe performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance nthey contrast each other wonderfully and while watsons portrayal of jackie du pr is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic both characters are charged with emotion nthe frank cottrell boyce script which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr brings great deal of depth to these characters as well nthe script is also to be commended for its wellpolished dual nature ncottrell boyce adopts style which one might expect to see in mystery thriller which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert townes script for mission impossible and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame nthe latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story nsome will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised nnevertheless hilary and jackie is movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is decent watch all around
bsusan grangers review of two can play that game screen gems nsince the success of waiting to exhale there have been several romantic comedies about africanamerican professionals nthis female revenge fantasy vivica fox plays shante smith stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success mansion sporty car and an idyllic relationship with hunky hotshot lawyer morris chestnut nshes at point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girlfriends monique wendy racquel robinson tamala jones when your man messes up no matter how small it is she smugly decrees yuh gots to punish him nso when she catches her hot man dancing at bar with smart and sexy rival gabrielle union she devises her own version of the rules day tough love emotionally punishing plan to get him back nunfortunately writerdirector mark brown how to be player breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy you have to like the protagonist and shrill selfcongratulatory shante smith is smirking superficial spiteful shrew who does nt realize that rational rules can not always be applied to love nhaving her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the day one day two titlecard device underscores the tedium ncomic anthony anderson scores as chestnuts boisterous bestfriend and singer bobby brown does cameo as scuzzy mechanic who given smooth makeover by ms robinson nbut the outtakes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself non the granger movie gauge of to two can play that game is smarmy if slick filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements cocacola miller genuine draft but little else nin this rrated for explicit sexual language pseudohip battle of the sexes the audience loses
btime bandits from director terry gilliam is very different fantasy actionadventure movie about group of timetraveling dwarves led by randall david rappaport who have stolen map of the universe nthis map contains time hole that if exploited enable the men to travel back and forth through time nthe supreme being of the universe ralph richardson is the former employer of these treasureseeking bandits and he wishes desperately to regain the map nduring the travels he appears as ghostly face demanding that they return the map that they have stolen nbut according to randall they are just borrowing it nkevin young boy who seems quite bored with his life is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room which has portal for time traveling nhe joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang following them on their robberies ntheir first victim is napoleon ian holm whom they rob during battle that he is commanding nfrom here the group travels to the middle ages meeting up with robin hood himself neventually kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon played by sean connery nkevin accidentally saved the kings life and the king wishes to have kevin as his son nbut the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic nmeanwhile the evil genius david warner is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness attempting to find way in order to bring the men and the map to him nwhen randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness which supposedly contains the most fabulous object in the world the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes as he is convinced that they must travel there nonce inside the fortress of ultimate darkness it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive ntime bandits is fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone nwith terrific soundtrack courtesy of george harrison whom also was an executive producer time bandits is sure to be very surrealistic timetraveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone nterry gilliam however does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film although this does not affect the film that greatly nand finally if you liked labyrinth you ll love time bandits
bknown as the most successful highestgrossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck gold with pretty woman which opened quietly during the summer of but thanks to positive wordofmouth was able to reach upwards of million in theaters alone nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the films two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable nthe other winning element that makes pretty woman so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence which is rarely as palpable in todays films as it is here nedward lewis richard gere is suave extremely wealthy business mogul who at the start of the picture breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after nasty argument and abruptly takes his friends car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel nstopping the car along the street he asks woman obviously prostitute for directions nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike up conversation and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor nthis meeting does not lead to sex however as edward confides that he rather just have someone to talk to and offers her to spend the night njust as well since the hooker named vivian is beautiful generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned when edward finally offers to pay vivian threethousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and gettogethers nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss nallegedly planned as grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director pretty woman has been transformed in all senses of the word into classic fairy tale la cinderella nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been nyou honestly do nt need highiq or any iq for that matter to guess how the film will end and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and lessthangratifying and the screenplay is no award winner nand yet amidst all of these qualms and flaws pretty woman is an astoundingly charming motion picture and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers nyoud actually be amazed how far bemusement can go and there are few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are as romantic as anything ve seen on film in the nadditionally the film belongs and its success can be attributed to two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts nplaying sex symbols throughout the with such pictures as american gigolo and an officer and gentleman gere branches out here to play more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa njulia roberts in her breakthrough role after wellreceived mistic pizza and steel magnolia for which she was nominated for an academy award is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian who surprisingly could be role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line of work but more for her sheer intelligence nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely flake but screenwriter lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such thing nafter pretty woman roberts along with meg ryan became the reigning queen of romantic comedies with her latest being the justreleased runaway bride which repairs gere and roberts together once again and no wonder nroberts has continually proven to not only be strong actress with flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently do drama and in almost every film she appears in it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male costar nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his coworkers that vivian is actually prostitute and he then approaches her making sexual advances nno only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing as more professional eloquent young lady but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such way and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading and if she likes this particular path non the more dreamy side the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold especially one in which edward enters into the hotels lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing kiss to edward who is asleep and placing it on his lips since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in short couple of days pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene which is happy ending as you expect and would nt have it any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances nthis one misstep does not put damper on the rest of the film though because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such petty problem nhelped along by warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo as vivians best friend and roommate and fabulously catchy soundtrack in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movies overall fulfillment pretty woman is sparkler of motion picture and has what it takes to act as blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy
bi did nt realize how apt the name of this movie was until called the mpaa the motion picture association of america the folks who decide what nc pg or to ask why the preview was rated so that we can make some sense of their response let me tell you about the movie itself the celluloid closet is documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades nits brilliant funny naughty and extremely poignant nit tore at my heart to watch gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that as rule gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen nregardless of how veiled or how sordid the presence of gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be nthe movie itself is rated and for good reason nit contains scenes of bloody violent gay bashing and graphic uninhibited sex nas with any movie appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time so can decide for myself whether to see the movie with friend date my year old niece alone or not at all nbut that the movie nnow back to the preview nprior to this film being theatrically released it was originally filmed as documentary for hbo had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times nthere was no nudity no violence no bad language nothing that could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for general audience okay whoopi goldberg did refer to someone boning someone but the last knew that was nt one of the seven words you ca nt say on tv nexcept for scene of two fully clothed men kissing nhmmmmm nwhen inquired about the rating on the trailer very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from the handbook that trailer approved for all audiences could contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone nhello was in the office and it was the middle of the day nbravely pursued ve seen that trailer oh nprobably half dozen times gulped and do nt remember that scene well she chirped its there nour little eyes are trained to see that nno really nin the words of dave barry am not making this up nthey are trained to see that nwhen someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ngosh certainly do nt mean to question the mpaa or the handbook ni would however like to suggest that its they who are in the closet on this one nand the light ai nt good in there nbut having seen the celluloid closet and being one of handful of straight people involved in primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study email me and ill give you the details none of this was any big surprise nthe point of the movie was that homosexuality even in the politically correct is ridiculously perceived as threat to mostly heterosexual society na point well made in this candid and honest film nnow could go off on the mpaas ruling that trailer must contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and ask how that is defined particularly in light of some of the things both sexual and nonsexual that ve watched straight people do in trailers ni just do nt feel the need to go there because it seems so obvious nill instead suggest that the mpaa reevaluated their evaluation criteria nlet the ratings reflect not subject content like sex and violence nlet them reflect attitude content nin the future be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated for disrespectful or for stereotyped nthen truly be able to make an informed decision about how spent my time
desperate measures was something was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released summer nfor some reason it was delayed until hollywoods traditional dumping ground january nnow that its out see no real reason for that delay as its simple yet highly entertaining film nmichael keaton stars as maniacial murderer who bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of san francisco police detective garcia nkeaton agrees to the transplant only so he can attempt escape nhe succeeds in plan that of course could only work in the movies nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son nthe film definately has its flaws nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status nalso after keatons escape garcias captain barks at him how many men have to die to save your kids life nwhich the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark nthe thing is its vaild point nhow many people have to be needlessly crippled burned and killed just to save this one child nwhats the greater good here nmany lives or one life nif movies really had guts nowadays would have loved to have seen this movie come down to final choice for garcias character nplace him in situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else nalas movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audiences strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable ndespite few silly moments and one or two really stupid ones the good things about desperate measures outnumber the bad nthe main highlight would be keatons performance nthe character could have easily been an overacting scene chewing freak but keaton underplays it nicely nhes not as menacing as he was in pacific heights or even as menacing as he was in batman yes kids batman used to be dark character but you certainly get the idea that he evil neven the final scene of the film which normally would just hate seems strangely appropriate for this film nso much so that did nt mind it in the slightest nand another bonus the film takes place in san francisco which usually means car chase on those hills that you ve seen billion times before nand for moment it looked as though it was about to happen nbut it does nt and that creative nr

bif you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you nindeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative ripoffs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them nits difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film nbut at least were warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show nwhat are the four ingredients of really bad action movie nfirst the movie gives us an introductory premise nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared noooh scary nsecondly cheesy soundtrack tries to connote tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score nthird the main character is mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams nhe operates sophisticated militarystyle pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy nfinally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him nthey are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are nduring their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs nspotting cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster nyet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in matter of seconds nthis is nothing more than bythebook action film ntheir realization of the situation that they re in does nt happen until they are in the bowels of the boat nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed nthe corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scarefests must have nyet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments nbut most of it is just outright silly nand this film is unusually gory too nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains nthere is one particularly neat scene where monster has been cut apart and reveals victim that is still alive nhe screams horribly as the monsters digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away nadditionally it borrows heavily from speed alien and bunch of other recent films nthe mercenaries even run into lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock nto be honest when left the theatre just had to laugh at how witless the film was nits moronic fun at best nso if you re hankering for large bucket of popcorn served with side of silliness then this might just hit the spot

bjessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today nfrom timetotime she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances non the other hand this is the same woman who made her jawdroppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong nand much as lange would probably prefer moviegoers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality nhush is one such example nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film was nt such prime example of motion picture tedium nthe film opens as many socalled psychological thrillers do by posing as light drama nwe are introduced to jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow picture perfect young couple who are very much in love njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange nthe moment first saw martha started looking for fangs nsoon the wicked witch of the east is plotting way for her son to get helen pregnant this involves poking hole in diaphragm nonce that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives nas long as she gets her way martha is perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her its declaration of war nhush has three very simple problems its incredibly dumb its incredibly boring and its incredibly predictable at least up to the stupefying ending nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it with the exception of couple of nice shots of snowcovered fields and quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrows bare buttocks nfrankly its embarrassing to watch respected actress of langes stature give performance like this its like bad blanche dubois the role she played in tv version of streetcar named desire nmeanwhile paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts passable imitation of an inanimate object nas in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn nhere its mom and against wife with jackson caught in the middle nof course since schaechs character is poorlydeveloped and badly acted its impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation nmaybe someone should ask him if he familiar with oedipus nmartha is of course the evil one nhow do we know she evil nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work non the other hand helen is good girl nthe evidence for this is that she nice to old ladies and treasures locket with picture of her dead parents nthats about it for character development nbeyond that point hush is just series of increasingly hardtoswallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists nhowever the first minutes are just warmup for the ending which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying ni ca nt imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as whole liking this conclusion neither there was some serious lastminute editing or someone left out few pages of the script nbefore the climax disliked hush by the time the end credits started hated it nviewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable nmost entries into this wornout wormeaten genre are nt especially good nfilms like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along nin general however they re directed with degree of competence that assures level of sustained tension nthats not the case with really bad thrillers like this which fail to generate even momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care nindeed the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid
bin the first death wish movie mildmannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife nin the second he was avenging his daughter nin the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend nfourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz nhowever since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for nthis time karens teenage daughter dies of crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways nkerseys new targets unlike the previous movies are nt the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and wellconnected drug dealers neven such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan white john ryan determined to avenge the drugrelated death of his own daughter nwhites plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them nthe plan begins to take shape but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teckoh nfourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade nhowever although some critics might argue death wish the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really does nt feel the need to put much effort in his acting nhowever the hand of veteran director lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring nthere are some attempts for the movie to have plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is potentially interesting plot twist at the end nthe script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenzs character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years nthere are even some halfhearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons classics special note to xphiles mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the files could be seen in small role of cannery lab foreman
bits actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode the phantom menace because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy nand no really do nt feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the boxoffice nreally do nt nnot at all nthe plot has been done before mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it nthe center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and by the way what is it with bookstore owner main characters nin the past year and half we ve seen them in life is beautiful you ve got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore nshe immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from and comes to the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is young employee played by tom everett scott nhe reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him nafter while they fall in love well duh nkate feels guilty about getting in relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman tom selleck nto add to her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits nsupporting characters are nt called supporting for nothing ntheir purpose is nt just to move the plot along they re also supposed to give the storyline backbone nto do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting nrarely can movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them nthis is the love letters damning error ncapshaws character is as good as have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional nbecause of that the love letter is awkward and insincere neven worse its bore ni liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist nthere is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks there little that is even little amusing nthis is not completely thoughtless film and director peter hosun chan does good job of portraying helens yearnings and various subtle complexities nbut its far from profound nthere is nt common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless nreally this is harmless little movie its far from an abomination and its not torturous to sit through nbut bad it is nawful it also is nthe love letter is failure and an inane failure at that eugene novikov
ba sci ficomedy starring jack nicholson pierce brosnan annette benning glenn close martin short and other stars na warner bros picture nthe martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie nbefore entering the cinema was initially little bit nervous about what this film would be like nmany people were saying that this film was silly rubbish and there was no point to it all nhow wrong they were ni left this film feeling much happier than was before entered the cinema nthe story is about martians attacking earth nusing ray guns hooray nthey generally cause havoc around the and other countries nnicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion and also taking advice from his loopy officials nbut basically its load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth nthe way people are killed by the ray guns is great they is hillarous and mildly disturbing scene involving martian lady mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot and gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding nbut most of all this film is fun nthe martians are full of character the performances are spot on and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable nthe film is million times better then the dire independance day and is real tribute to the tacky invasion movies nthey are is great score by danny elfman and lots of laughs nthis has to be the best invasion ve seen for long time
bso much for sweet returns nafter smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative slasher movies starting with scream and followed by scream urban legend and the original know what you did last summer film like still know what you did last summer was bound to be made sooner or late nit is perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowestcommondenominator in filmmaking favoring nonstop deaths and gore for suspense and trading in fleshed out likable characters for onedimensional nitwits nit has been exactly one year since julie james jennifer love hewitt suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road and then thinking he was dead dumped him into the ocean nsince then julie has relocated to boston university and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams she has been able to put her life back together nwhen julies friend karla brandy is called up by radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is she wins vacation to the bahamas for four people which also includes karlas horny boyfriend tyrell mekhi phifer and will matthew settle who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend ray freddie prinze jr also returning from the original does nt show up nwhen they reach the secluded island they discover it is the last day of the open season and will be stranded there for the th of july weekend with few employees to fend off violent storm headed for them nof course julie her friends and the workers are nt the only ones there as the murderous ben willis dressed in fisherman garb returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all nit is sad state of affairs when movie like still know what you did last summer is made ni am very big fan of horror movies and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to ikwydls which am fan of is almost an exact replica of friday the th movie nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters as well as genuinely suspenseful moments thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson who did nt return to write the sequel and it shows still know nhas no story to speak of and is so vacuous of ideas that the filmmakers were forced to have murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested nalso gone are any signs of character development and since every single character died before got to know them all was left with was to stare at the screen indifferent to what was going on nwhile cared about the fates of the characters in the original it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died nthey were all paperthin and pointless except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman nanother element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setpieces like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar but there are none to speak of in this sequel although they do come close at one moment with brandy nsince so many people were killed every couple minutes the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water nalso of note is the mystery of the second killer and accomplice to ben but it is obvious from the first frame who it is and so could nt even have fun at that like did in the scream movies and urban legend nit figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again film would come along and ruin it for everyone else nmaybe the people who made still know what you did last summer should have realized that in order to make good movie you must have screenplayor at least one that is nt such black hole for thoughts and ideas nthe ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for third part but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead
bthe calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that has nt prevented columbia pictures from trotting out lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscarbait season nbille augusts highprofile adaptation of victor hugos classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from classy hollywood epichandsome production values strong performances by topnotch cast literate screenplaywith one critically missing element emotional sweep nfor those not familiar with hugos original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like thcentury frenchset version of the fugitive nafter serving years in prison work camp for stealing loaf of bread the brutish jean valjean liam neeson is paroled nimmediately upon release he steals valuable silverware from kindly bishop who takes him in for night he is caught by authorities only to be forgiven by the bishop who lets valjean keep the silver to start new life on the straight and narrow nthat he does and in doing so breaks his parole which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert geoffrey rush who was one of the guards in valjeans prison camp on his trail nthematically however les miserables is story about redemption which valjean finds through his dealings with two women the hardluck factoryworkerturnedprostitute fantine uma thurman and her illegitimate daughter cosette nyears after breaking parole valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau where he forms warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette mimi newman from her cruel caretakers the thenardiers and raise the child as his own nthe father and daughter eventually land in paris where the teenage cosette claire danes falls for dashing student revolutionary marius hans matheson nthe decadesspanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of and the danish august turns in his most accomplished englishlanguage work following the underrated superstar soap the house of the spirits and last years stylish but highly preposterous mystery smillas sense of snow nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at brisk pace nproduction designer anna asp costume designer gabriella pescucci and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable rushs finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated oscarwinning theatrics in shine and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role nthe younger members of the cast fare less well ndanes is convincing as cosette but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes distraction and matheson while competent is less interesting robert sean leonard nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is by the time les miserables was over my emotions had only been superficially involved nwhile was touched by valjeans relationships with fantine and cosette was not moved nnot even reaching the touching level is the cosettemarius pairing nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical as am sure many others is and was dismayed to see eponine friend of mariuss who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation the daughter of the thenardiers here she is only briefly seen as child nher presence would have added some muchneeded conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance but suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine fantine was enough neven so as creeps into summer blockbuster season les miserables is thoughtful wellmade entertaining film one that will sate moviegoers hungry for dose of drama before popcorn nobrainers invade the multiplex
byour friends and neighbors is rather bizarre film about people who hop in and out of bed with each other nwritten and directed by neil labute who first film in the company of men was simply marvelous disappoints bit here with this one nthe story involves two couples ben stiller catherine keener and aaron eckhart amy brenneman an artist assistant nastassja kinski and an egotistical women abuser jason patric nthe characters names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie neach of the characters has their own sexual style and they do nt seem to merge together well nso the group experiments behind their respective partners back nthere are some hysterical scenes one involves jason patric aaron eckhart and ben stillers characters nthey are all in sauna talking about their best lay when jason patrics character makes surprising confession nthe whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted nthe enjoyed this movie although it seemed tad lengthy even though it only runs min nthe films cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener aaron eckhart and jason patric ni would not recommend this film to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit nit did seem to offend people more than half of the people in the theater left during the film nalthough your friends and neighbors does nt have the power of labutes earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny while maintaining melancholy philosophy on human relationships
bto sum the entire film up in one sentence it would be watch vh documentary instead seems like someone brought william faulkner into brought him into studio got him really drunk told him to write about it and then dumbed that down to be released to the public na sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex drugs and disco nthe narrator shane oshae ryan phillippe works as grease monkey in new jersey who of course on whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio nphillippe gives passable performance which could have been made by any young attractive actor with six pack stomach nhe is let in by steve rubbell mike myers the infamous coowner of studio because he is attractive nhe eventually becomes bus boy and then bartender nyou expected more did nt you nthere is nt nthe film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as its climax is nt that an apt word for studio lands with thud nthe glitz of the club and perpetually semiclothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the its glamour nfor much of its target audience college age to early thirties it attempts to show celebrities mixing with normal people nthis even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote nyou can be sure that half of the audience has nt heard of them another quarter only know their names and the other quarter knew they were there already nthe humor if you can call it that is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then nthe best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high sexually ambivlaent very new york steve rubell nhe seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive nhe looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving subdued almost nostalgic performance when needed nit reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on coffee talk sans dress and wig nthe supporting cast of salma hayek breckin meyer and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere nthe romance between phillippe and cambell as soap opera star is completely implausable nthe two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes nhayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband greg meyer stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend nthe subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and half long noverall tried to give view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine nthe film never leads to anything has no obserable point and covers up lack of real plot with veil of beautiful people nin truth that reminded me of the eighies

bpleasantville taps into hollywoods lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed www pleasantville com april friday ncast tobey maguire reese witherspoon william macy joan allen nwalsh jeff daniels nmpaa rating pg for sexual content and thematic elements ngenre drama nin my opinion nin short it takes lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film one can easily be misled as to what the real message is nreview in literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life such as rain fire or emotions nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective pleasant nthere is no sadness no fear no danger no discomfort no love and no hate nput simply its place alanis morissette could really work wonders for nj one big note however is that it is only sitcom that airs in reruns on an oldies tv station or is it ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day was not disappointed ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back more times in the period it endured at the box office nbut it was nt until months later when slipped in for small showing in one of those crummy dollar theaters after not having seen it for so long that my eyes were opened to such deeper meaning and perspective than had previously experienced nit is far too feasible misconception that this is film which forwards the idea that world without some healthy immorality is not world at all ninstead the actual message which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that know of is that world without immorality does nt give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself because everything is automatically right nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made no space for growth and never anything new to learn and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story nnow not saying that necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be nbesides hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white its hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more na truly intelligent addition to it all however is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork nthat said the plot goes as such ndavid and jennifer are two very high school twins with the typical relationship outline of dontmesswithmylifeandiwontmesswithyours nthey demonstrate the wellknown teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today ndavid is the shyer subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv while jennifer is the wild licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation nbut when freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home nnevertheless jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to more unrestrained approach to life and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed nand as said earlier not to flip the town around into some corrupt society but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place npeople got hurt nthey cried nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves and that when their physical world turned colors as well nthis can be looked upon as quite controversial movie but to me the message is finally clear ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run well never know what we could have done better nuntil the next great movie see remain sincerely danielle flynn imr

bmy friend here in film school just made two minutelong film for one of his classes that includes staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with banana being used as the instrument of penetration nas sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ve ever witnessed nsure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest nthen there caligula nthis film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies greasedup fist forced up mans rear wine poured down man who had his urinary tracts tied off penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred the events were graphically shot in clear view the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy the film was million dollar production with lavish sets rather impressive cast and whopping hour running time nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining nafter all its not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry nno film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what its about its about how its about as the old cliche goes nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and that that its nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without second of credibility in its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as blessing or nso guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons nthe film opens on the wrong note of course with quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the overused passage what shall it profit man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in field suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have soul in the first place nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell performance that does the opposite that his performance in clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but ca nt wait for the current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne nthen he abuses his position marries woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he does nt just have to sleep with his sister dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position little more little more and little more and then believe invades england then is killed off nthe filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like noh is nt it great that they just loved having sex nand that they killed people so disgustingly nand would nt it be great if could make couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though its so blatantly real bad porn that ve completely convinced myself that its not ni mean why not just show roman orgy when can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up nand its not just that its disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film its that in film where the entire feel its going for is nt felt its also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time nthe sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this nbut that does nt matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark nthe camera operation is also the worst ve ever seen in my entire life nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow nthere is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that its adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that ca nt in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over could say them with straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last year or so nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere nthe orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra going to kill my agent going to kill my agent nand so on and so on for over hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying nguccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made film that is such painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage nthroughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what can get away with nand if you do nt like this then you re prig and worse than that you know nothing about history nuh huh ntheres clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that artistically good na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for good film nbut using historical accuracy as licence to get away with any kind of disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts is total total bullshit and all can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film ntheres film that came out in called the cook the thief his wife and her lover magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even little cannibalism for good measure nthat film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in way that was shocking yes but also in bizarre way entertaining and totally involving nthere were real characters there in real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that its going to be offensive to many nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good nand its

bbattlefield long boring and just plain stupid nbattlefield earth na film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman nin my midteen years had horrendous reoccurring nightmare nbehind the wheel of car was driving down straight road in the middle of desert nno scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway nno matter what did the view did nt change travelling but not getting anywhere neach time awoke in sweat terrified nyou do nt have to be carl jung to understand that dream npowerless to make changes trapped in boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake nthis is exactly how you will feel minutes after battlefield earth begins nfor all of its flash and style ron hubbards science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of ndull and stupid nin the year the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for years nhumans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians ntheres no hope nthe future is bleak nthen the psychlo make mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race nits an archetypal postapocalyptic plot full of promise nconsidering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen its difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably nbut it does nthe story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits nare we really supposed to believe that after millennium of looking for gold the psychlo never discovered fort knox nor that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up nor that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships nor that the psychlo spy cameras somehow do nt notice that their slaves are missing for days ntravolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he worth and is almost entertaining nalmost nthe rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person mananimal or not would ever utter nsome of the film looks good but it also looks so familiar na race of large hulking apelike creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin nsound like something charlton heston might be in nthe psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune nthe final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their hightech city is something george lucas might have been associated with nits too loud nits too oppressive nits too slow nits too long far ntoo long nand on it goes nthe list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless nits difficult to find anything in the film that does work noh yeah nthe color scheme is nice nthe real question is how this movie ever got made ncould it have something to do with the fact that ron hubbard was the founder of scientology nand that john travolta is member of the church nthat might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago nbut it does nt give us clue as to why firsttime screenwriter corey mandells atrocious script was used nor why the highprofile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed major film nor why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems nthe one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costners the postman which begrudgingly admit as guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure battlefield earth has the honor sewed up noften reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video nthats not the case here nyou can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one ndont hesitate nstrike now while the iron is cold
bthe happy bastards quick movie review nwild wild west na better name for this movie might ve been wild wild waste nwarner bros in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mibs success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster contemporary bigscreen update to the classic westernscifi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad nbut somehow they ran into problem along the way nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference story writer nwild wild wests story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon nif warner bros had gotten him the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is nheck ten times nas is however the story and screenplay is mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he performing them and complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well nheres the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in steamcontrolled wheelchair nthey catch onto plot of his involving superweapon that can basically be considered an foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path nas said the way the script unfolds is complete mess nbut the acting does nt help either nkevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even smidgeon of care as he did in the western silverado nsmith seems to be having better time as west although he not nearly as charming as he was in mib nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we ca nt even stand to look at him or his strange beard nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention nher acting is barely passable but what breath of fresh ass ndirector barry sonnenfeld is nt of great help either neven though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost nits as if he feels he directing tv movie big nono when you re helming what supposed to be bigscreen hit nlast but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable nat one point smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train nhe jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while its still in motion nalso he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks nlast but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he not kissing woman as he looking through peephole at the enemy nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects nthe huge mechanical spider is technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show ntheres also good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again logic question comes into play regarding their polarity ni would say sit back and have good time with wild wild west but it really is nt possible nif the racist and sex jokes do nt bother you the performances will nif the performances do nt bother you the story will nif the story does nt bother you the racist and sex jokes will ntheres no end to the vicious circle ngo rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats nyoull have better time nif you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in role as president grant ni bet he wishes he were somewhere else
blet me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film really was nt looking forward to it as much as have with some of the previous films nim not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the everpresent dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years nim happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first minutes of the film nby that point it was evident that mr bond was back with vengeance nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film were nt exactly pleasant experience nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts nit took reminder from an audience member to clue them in ni guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain nanyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for settled in for bond ni think the most noticeable aspect of this the th film in the series is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films nthere were probably more oneliners in this movie than in the last several combined nand bonds last oneliner in the film is about the best of the series nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for nfor the most part the action sequences worked very well nalthough there were couple of times that thought some things were bit over the top even for bond film ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted nwhile he did good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film nmost noticeably sequences on snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie nhe almost seemed like he did nt know what he was doing nbut they were brief scenes and really should nt take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing nif you have ever seen bond film you wo nt be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit nthe world is not enough is no exception nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who has bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain nwhy this point is included is beyond me nthey took great pains to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought nanyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving mideast oil pipeline ni guess world domination just is nt as attractive to terrorists as money making venture anymore nbond is brought in to protect the pipelines owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renards recent victims nalong the way bond has to enlist the help of nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle nlike all bond films you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films nthere was at least one point that had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing nthe buddy that saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceaus character nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film nlater it became big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something nbut because it is bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly nafter all it is nt shakespeare nhow about the cast nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond so really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character njudi dench as had bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie ncoltrane gets more screen time which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes nthen there are the bond girls nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her natural to play the innocent victim nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just pretty face nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play bond love interest nthen we have denise richards nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks nand after you see the outfits she wears you wo nt have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producers eyes ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist nadmittedly there was one point that the audience snickered bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessors nicely ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyles character nwhile carlyle did fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground ni guess was hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character nthis might have worked well in another movie but do nt go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations nlast but not least we have desmond llewelyn as this is the th appearance for llewelyn as bonds gadget guy and he is as good as ever nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still treat to watch nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role nhe says future appearances are up to higher power nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese nwhile we do nt see much of him in this film think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyns legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands nso how does it stack up ndespite some problems the world is not enough is very entertaining movie nand all things considered what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films nit may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top none thing is for sure even after movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series nheres looking forward to bond number
bcapsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark dash of jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and dollop of cgi nsimmer for minutes nyields zilch nthe phantom is depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteenminute mark started cataloguing them out loud nits hard to make good actionadventure movie that does nt simply recycle its predecessors and ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully nthe phantom allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name does nt even bother to be graceful nits stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ill try nthe film opens up with prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out nwe go from there to jungle sequence that swear to god recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote possibly even shotforshot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from sorcerer as well nsorcerer as you may well remember was remake of french movie the wages of fear in which bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain nboth versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ve got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go nanyway the cinematic theft does nt stop there nor at least the lack of inspiration nthere is nt single thing here we have nt seen and its not given to us in way that remotely evokes our interest nwe have where my list na bad girl tough good girl secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr nno than anything else boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear fu manchu mustache and sneer lot and generally humiliate himself nwhat else is there nthe plot is waste of time nthe sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey nthere are lines in the script that are just begging to be mstked and sure once mike and the bots get the cash they ll stick it on their sked nthe only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane he good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of scene after another nall can say is that pray this is nt the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie
bany remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as perfect murder illustrates nfrankly dial for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement nunfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace little perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of wouldbe thriller nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what going on so that these flaws in logic do nt become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled nunfortunately in perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they re happening nthis is very bad sign nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder nof course in the case of perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters na perfect murder is nt strict remake of dial for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play which was also the source material for hitchcocks version as well as madefortv retelling nemily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes michael douglas ntheir marriage is nt going well emily resents stevens controlling instincts and as form of rebellion she is having an affair with penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen nwhen steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach is nt that of typical cuckolded husband ninstead of yelling or threatening steven offers david proposal that too good to resist for in cash before the rest after he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how he supposed to get the rest nultimately not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to the coldhearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for halfamillion or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but they re not interesting its possible to make good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there is nt nsteven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting text book on stereotypes nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep he gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife ngwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of worst thrillers the other being hush nat least viggo mortensen njane has little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emilys best friend na perfect murder is plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end nthere are nt many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start nits surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn living nits just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
ba new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two nottoobright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nations biggest presidential scandal nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver fan letter from arlenes watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across gordon liddy played deadon by harry shearer and the infamous breakin nwhen they recognize liddy later on during white house field trip they are ushered into conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with nwhen they discover that nixon another deadon performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned nduring prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the presidents resignation nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry kingtype talk show featuring cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat nfrom there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy nat one point the girls are having to scream over high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film nif this movie had been smarter would have been less likely to fault its juvenile bathroom humor but its not nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audiences throat in the least subtle way possible ni do nt recall oliver stones nixon having to pander to its audience but of course that film was nt comedy aimed squarely at yearold film going audience nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is its remarkable supporting cast ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mccullochs woodward and bernstein nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating ni wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final halfhour ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are major highlight especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to porno theater by betsys brother nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with nid like to see the same cast portray these characters in script more suited towards their comedic abilities nas for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film highly dubious distinction at best nstay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie nan excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been great movie nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds nas it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes nand that to me does not make funny movie npg
bafter the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction jackie brown seems like something of lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino nits more of hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language nluckily his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer nthe story introduces us to streetwise black woman named jackie brown pam grier flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another nshe works for bottomofthebarrel airline and receives minimal salary nbut one day she is picked up by pair of federal officials including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet and found with handsome load of cash and small bag of smuggled dope njackie is working for weapons dealer named ordell samuel jackson who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation nsoon jackie and ordell are plotting way to smuggle through to them under nicolets nose with the help of ordells oaf of partner robert de niro and druggedout lady friend bridget fonda nalso entering the picture is bailbondsman named max cherry robert forster who takes liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated how wo nt say nthe big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags filled with cash switch hands nits unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there and does nt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so nthere are as always amusing exchanges between characters nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq or lack thereof nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie na year old white bail bondsman and year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry nyouve got to commend the acting njackie brown is seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting nthe film clocks in at lengthy hours minutes ntarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily but there are more than few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline nalso fans of the director should be prepared for lighter side to appear njackie brown has four major shootings and two of those take place mostly offscreen so do nt be expecting typical tarantino bloodbath nyou can expect frequent foul language mostly coming way of ordell who much to the dismay of spike lee uses the word as part of his regular vocabulary nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together ngrier making sudden comeback from her reign in the is more than adequate for the title character nin fact she flatout great nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster who does grand job as max cherry and is perfectly cast in doing so nmichael keaton makes his presence felt albeit in small but dignified moments and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge nspeaking of that bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe and yet she manages to look fairly occupied ntheres not single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie nwhich is lifesaver for mr tarantino nthe story barely holds together in the meantime and we merely get small tremor whenever there should be defeaning earthquake nbut oh well njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work nlets just hope that the director has nt gone soft on us
know what you did last summer the first highprofile slasher thriller to be released after scream and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is stylish effective horror film that became biggest hit of the fall season nwhile scream was more knowing film about the genre know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of straightforward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottomofthebarrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the friday the th films well okay jason goes to hell was pure hell to sit through nthe film starts off with four talented aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport nit is the th of july and they will soon be heading their separate ways nkindhearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off to college while helen sarah michelle gellar who has just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going to new york to become an actress and football player nwhen the four of them travel to nearby mountainside beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting man in the road on their way home ndistraught and confused they decide they ca nt go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter so they devise plan to throw the apparently dead victim off peer into the ocean in hopes no one will find him njulie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it by barry nswitch to exactly year later julie still unable to come to terms with what she did reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out nalmost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding giant hook know what you did last summer is successful horror film for number of reasons nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian as it put shadows fog steam and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings nthe characters particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in few scenes which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort nand last the film creates few dazzling and scary setpieces that are some of the most memorable ve seen in horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her familys store with the killer inside with her nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit nheches performance is standout as she is able to create full character in only about ten minutes of screen time know what you did last summer could have been great horror movie if not for few problems nprinze jr gives performance to be desired here and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth nalso the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines nluckily the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale which includes an expertly crafted jumpinyourseat scare nin the main roles hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamers ve ever heard nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis little competition for the best scream queen nand gellar is touching as young woman who in the course of one year finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered nalthough not up to the level of either scream movies or the more recent urban legend know what you did last summer is respectable smartlyscripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made
bthere is nt much good about this movie nnot much can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie nso ill get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin did nt direct it or it would be titled technicolor city nin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end nthe plot has tendency to be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been fascinating movie nthe plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets so will just touch on the bare minimum njohn murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of cheap hotel only to find out he has forgotten everything njohn must find out who he is before the strangers nmind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy nduring the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people nany of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script nas mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film nthe acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care nthe special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake sign of true bmovie nthe direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in movie switching realities constantly nlastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and does nt deserve to have the word science in sciencefiction nif have nt got my point across ill say it more plainly this is bad movie nlets hope the next movie by alex wish was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable
bthe new austin powers film continues movie tradition begun in the eighties nproduce something anything that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens nthe usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here ngross humor sex jokes silly sight gags more sex jokes nand the film is strong contender in the current race to be cruder grosser and more outrageous than that last film nwhat the film is not however is funny nthe plot centers around the return of dr evil who goes back in time to steal austin powers mojo liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austins pelvis which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies naustin must go after him and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday ni almost avoided this film because did not like the original nbut the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews ni wish had stuck to my first impression nmyers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation nand he has the talent to do it at least as an actor nbut the material he is working with here much of it his own falls short of anything resembling comic genius nthis movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces fivehundredpound fat mans butt crack and barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average year old nafter some of these scenes one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention nthe direction also helps the film achieve new low point in cinematic humor nfor the most part felt as if was watching saturday morning chalderns live action tv show nthere is no sense of comic timing or subtlety nthe director just throws the material at us giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with camera could be film director ni am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under crowd at least the ones who have yet to discover literacy ncertainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face kick you in the teeth take no prisoners actionverb blah blah blah nif you see the film and you find you re not laughing there is nothing wrong with you nit just means you grew up since seventh grade
bone of the last entries in the longrunning carry on series carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves group of holidaymakers descending on caravan site nprofessors anna vrooshka elke sommer and roland crump kenneth williams and group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep kenneth connor so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains nanna has little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick for instance when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan she means that she wants scrubbing brush to clean the caravan narthur upmore bernard bresslaw and his wife linda patsy rowlands take her mother daphne barnes joan sims and her minah bird on holiday with them nmotherinlaw jokes prevail nfurthermore the trouble that joe and norma baxter ian lavender and adrienne posta have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families nfred ramsden windsor davies and ernie bragg jack douglas leave their wives liz fraser and patricia franklin behind for fishing holiday nhowever they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls sandra carol hawkins and carol sherrie hewson nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the daytoday running of the camp the search for the minah bid and greyhound the major fred and ernies desperate need of woman misunderstanding leading to striptease at the caravan parks pub and shock in store for daphne nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing nthis is what binds the movie together njoan sims stands out as the demanding motherinlaw bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are welcome addition to the cast non the other hand there are lowkey performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors nalthough the regular cast is depleted the ones that remain show that they can still make good carry on film na relative flop at the cinema this movie deserves lot more recognition
bnaturally at the core of leon gasts when we were kings is the fight itself for what fight it was nthanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman nfans were treated to an round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore nwith the benefit of the firsthand recollections of that old expug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back to life nbut when we were kings tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of boxing match nquestions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary ngast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali na member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gasts film with forceful swipe at the united states nwhen ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind nhis decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons ndespite showcasing alis proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion nlistening to the films numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on map nspike lee tells us that the event was pilgrimage coming home to africa nforeman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation nfair enough but this homeland is specific nation cursed with less than inspiring reality nit is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu brutal dictator nwhile ali respects mobutus ability to forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents wellstocked torture chambers nmailers insights are lost on most of the films commentators ngeorge plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire nwith admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire squalid ruling elite nmobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power ndon king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the messiah label attributed to him by loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of new black international solidarity nunderstandably foreman believes he has gotten raw deal nhe may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king nafrica zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of black unity nlittle wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that alis opponent was nt white nadmittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored nthe audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time nthere is just too much to cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for protracted political analysis to be justified nthe excitement of james brown and king in concert for instance nand of course there always ali to consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gon na get it on coz we do nt get along ndoubtlessly considering the multifaceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention nfortunately by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event
bin my reviews try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see ni realize that we all have different tastes and can not predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike nbut in the case of american beauty must make an exception nif you have nt yet seen it go see it nnow nstop reading this review and head for your local multiplex then after you ve seen it come back nill wait here nwelcome back nif you followed my advice and see no reason why you should not have do you nim sure you ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life namerican beauty is an extraordinary film powerful jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream nits humorous but it is nt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production nmixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended and by god it works making it one of the years very best nlester burnham kevin spacey has entered the mother of all midlife crises nhe is living life without purpose nhe is bored depressed and sick of his sheltered insignificant existence nhe barely ever talks to his family has no sex life is stuck at deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live nbut one day when he and his equally troubled wife annette bening attend one of his daughters thora birch cheerleading performances he sees something that makes him come alive nwhat he sees is the performance by his daughters friend the head cheerleader nhe develops lust for the promiscuous young girl an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature nbut for the first time lester feels that he is actually living nthis crush is only the beginning nlester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life buying the car of his dreams cursing off the boss and quitting his job today quit my job told the boss to himself and blackmailed him for would you pass the asparagus please nbuying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor ricky fitts teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be beauty and refusing to be docile in family affairs nhis new attitude further alienates his daughter only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be and inspiring her to enter relationship with her eccentric neighbor nand the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with significant chunk of its dramatic momentum nricky fitts wes bentley serves as the films thematic center providing the obscure powerful meaning of the title ncolonel fitts the father is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie even considering his limited screentime nkevin spacey has never been better and this performance will certainly earn him chance to put little gold person on his mantel nhe never plays his droll character as freak rather he effectively portrays him as normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life nspacey is poignant and devastating in the role of lifetime nequally astonishing is young thora birch who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness nat two hours and ten minutes american beauty did nt feel nearly long enough nits complicated unforgettable film that like the ice storm two years ago dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life npowerfully and cynically it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream nit claims that this pictureperfect image is just that an image and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it nthe dark deeply ironic ending though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie stays with you for weeks after its all over namerican beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released even more so considering its masterpiece
bback in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention new line cinema put on lavish presentation for its bigscreen update of the cult scifi tv show lost in space complete with inperson appearances by cast members mimi rogers matt leblanc lacey chabert jack johnson and even gary oldman nthat should have set off my warning alarmsthe last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an inperson cameo to peddle nlast action hero nbut no like millions of others bought into the hype and got lost nif only had gotten lostliterallyon the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slappedtogether blockbuster wannabe nyou may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film nat the convention goldsman claimed to be rabid fan of the original television series and if that really is the case hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in nto say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is narrative to begin withwhich there most certainly is not nafter the setup in which the robinson familyfather john william hurt looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews mother maureen rogers wasted daughters judy heather graham ditto and penny heavily madeup chabert looking like junior version of neve campbell in wild things and son will young newcomer johnson making the best of it and pilot don west leblanc doing bad han solo impression find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr smith watereddown but stilllively oldman cashing paycheck and loving every minute the scripts stream of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes alongand hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting nthey encounter another ship nthey board it nalien spiders attack them nthey return to their ship nthe other one explodes nthey land on deserted planet nand so on nan attempt at plot involving time travel occurs in the third act but goldsman does nt seem to understand the rules that come with using such story device when one characters past self dies the future incarnation inexplicably lives on nthe look and effects should be lost in spaces aceinthehole but hopkins even manages to botch that nfor bigbudget film the visual effects are incredibly shoddy nin one composite background shot could see the blue outline around oldman the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like ndigital effects nbut nothing in those shots is as jawdroppingly unconvincing as blawp monkeylike space creature that becomes pennys pet nentirely computergenerated and every inch showing it blawp looks like it was lifted directly from sony playstation game napparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it how else can one explain the graininess of blawps composite shots with the human actors nbut in doing so the seams are that much more obvious nyou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by crystalclear solo reaction shot of judy nnew line is hoping lost in space will become big franchise much like the longrunning star trek cash cow at paramount ni do nt think so nin few years the lost in space movie will likely live on not as series but as the obscure answer to trivia question what film ended titanics week reign at the top of the weekend box office
barriving in barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year nhowever like the golden child although blair witch has made lot of money its not very good ndonahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make documentary about the blair witch myth nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles nalthough events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on nalthough an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than missed opportunity nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise nmost of the dialogue is adlibbed and still manages to sound like poor bmovie nthe script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the fword included lot to sound like students nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then its back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly nif wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout lot and swear go on scout camp nbut no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but not quite sure how nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes nwith no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is small sense of fear underlying throughout the film nhowever because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the ck is that na lot and mike giggling like loony ntheres also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all nthe film gives half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it is nt very convincing nalso the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following large river flowing through the woods to civilisation nthere are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heathers apology being major one nthe blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver ni suppose if you ve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other of the paying audience who have nt been lost in the woods napart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull nthe spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide nalthough good idea its not executed well enough to be fun scary cinema experience nits worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com is better than the film
btitanic is without doubt the best movie ve seen all year nand believe me not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was overhyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water nthank god this film got delayed until december nits my christmas present ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of yearsgoneby and it is truly stunning film nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer its gon na last despite its hour plus running time nas friend of mine who true titanicbuff said if someone does nt like this film its because they did nt want to ntruer words are hard to come by nof course it does nt hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time nif you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator true lies etc still care to disagree nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it nand to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs nits obvious he truly loves titanic nthe film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxtons character would be worth more than the hope diamond today ntheir search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead drawing of young woman wearing the diamond nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past nroses narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she did nt want to marry nher mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant nthey are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal nmeanwhile young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in poker game nthey are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving nfor them this is their ticket to america to better life nfor rose she is sailing to her doom nthe first hour and half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love nits the classic wrongsideofthetracks story and does sometimes resort to few cliches nbut as said above the love portion is nt sappy and does nt weigh the film down as some critics have said nits sweet and it did nt make me restless at all despite the fact that usually hate love stories nof course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch nof course things really start to get going after the hour and half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins slow sink to the bottom nthe sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing nit is not told in heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths nthe best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future nthe crew who at first had been skeptical of roses story now are totally aborbed by her nrose goes out onto the ships ledge and we then learn secret about her that catches us off guard nwe then see dream of roses in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson nmost people talked with after the movie saw this as only dream nhowever think it symbolized more think it meant that rose had died and is going to sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this email me at venomhotmail com
barmageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking nstories have been replaced with special effects character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue plotting consists of bunch of shit getting blown up narmageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie you ll see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer nbut loved every freaking minute of it nbelieve me just as shocked as you are nhell do nt even know why went to see it in the first place nthe previews were so annoying that predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year or at least in the running nim sorry but somebody dial nisnt quite the tagging that going to sell movie nit is nt too wise either to market the film using the movies stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing ni mean lets face it armageddons previews rival the truman shows as being some of the worst of the year nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice nof course you all know the story nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the uss top oil drillers to go into space and implant nuclear device eighthundred and someodd feet into the asteroid nin the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced to some interesting and not so interesting characters nbelonging to the former group is rockhound steve buscemi horny little womanizing genius who always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at huge amount of gs nalso there the always coolashell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo only without the intensity and great lines to deliver nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent ca nt quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie nbasically that about it nas said this is hardly film about plot nits another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden ncase in point nasa does nt know that there is even an asteroid on its way until eighteen days before impact huh nanother example at one point in the movie two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of poster of kennedy nhow pretentious is that nwant another one nokay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on jet plane and soon all the rest join in ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture nbut naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies nand do nt get me wrong despite all of the things found wrong with armageddon still very much enjoyed it nso even if you do nt win one of mcdonalds free tickets its still definitely worth checking out
bit is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing child whether that may be in life or in death nafter having said that will also say that this movie does all of the above very well none gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for costly mistake or when husband hugs his wife after long estrangement nthere is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people nin fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie nso what are the lessons learnt ndont take your children to class reunions do nt leave them alone in the lobby not even for second nmichelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of highlystrung wife and mother trend that started with thousand acres and one fine day nmy comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively nwhoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing lesbian cop with name that makes one want to reach for lollipop nlastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes to mind
warning the following review contains spoilers ncast gary sinise don cheadle connie nielsen jerry oconnell kim delaney tim robbins elise neal jill teed jody thompson bill timoney written by jim thomas john thomas and graham yost directed by brian depalma running time minutes nthe first big event movie of turns out to be anything but ngary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from mars mission when his astronaut wife maggie kim delaney becomes ill and passes away ndon cheadle is then given the mission along with russian couple and young hotshot nwhen strange whirlwind shot from the top of mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them neilsen and oconnell perform rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining nwhat they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected nbefore ever saw the film was aware of the promotional campaign with dr pepper nevery time would see bottle of the soft drink the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it nlittle did know that the plot would be taking back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products ndr pepper saves the day at one point and dream sequenceflashback features jerry oconnell shoving mms in our face nthese are but couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film nclich are also the order of the day with mission to mars ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style even independence day which lifted all of its premises from other scifi films was better than this film and do nt like independence day nfilms like space odyssey the abyss and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from and poorly at that nthere is even sequence where rover is traveling through canyon and could nt help but whisper utinni to myself and wait for jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get glimpse of it nthis film also features one of my alltime least favorite movie clich the he would have wanted you to have this moment where one character gives another trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films but in film as clich ridden as this it is particularly irritating nennio morricones music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on but here it is dreadfully overbearing nhis music sounds like it came straight out of vincent price movie in certain scenes nat other times his music is unbearably overdramatic none sequence involving daring spacewalk rescue is given particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue wo nt reach its intended target nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife but felt extreme boredom coupled with twinge of disinterest nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into popsicle except to invoke an emotional response could think of at least one way to save him and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be smarter than am nduring the finale when we are finally introduced to the translucent conehead kittyfaced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn na brief history lesson about where we came from is proffered then sinise is whisked away to be with the rest of our people he does this because his late wife proclaims in video he watches early on that this is chance to step foot where no one else has nfrom the press ve been seeing this film receive it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying quick death at the theater nim sure the first weekend or two will be huge but once word gets out people will stop going nlets just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and is nt hurt by the negativity this film is generating nid venture to say it wo nt be worse than this waste of time npg
easely one of the worst films of the year nwith the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century nthis time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil nthe result is somewhat predictable ni did nt have high hopes about arnolds much anticipated return to the big screen nschwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers wo nt be bored and the catholic league will be angry neveryone else will see end of days for what it is deliciously bad motion picture nthink of it as hollywoods own yk bug ndid you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers you ll get as in nyes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days nthis time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun to behold nhe coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc nthe way it works is he smirks and something explodes nbefore the stroke of the new millennium he got to find and impregnate certain woman in order to climb out from under heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations nonly schwarzeneggers cop attached to an antiterrorist unit can stop him nfilms like this has one serious weakness logic nno matter how you twist the plot you ll find it incredibly stupid even for schwartzenegger movie nthe incredible fact is that such directors never learn nafter thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich nhere the devil looks more like sex addicted maniac that has just got out of mental institution nhe is walking around blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in meter radius nall he wants is the girl that is somehow special nbut schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in church where satan dare not enter nso the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back ncan give you happiness that you can only dream of just ngive me the address nindeed with script like that you could make wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting to create provoking an dramatic thriller nand for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will not be very satisfied nweve not seen him in while nthats because he did nt have worthy opponent nhe has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars nhe has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop nso after all those fights what left for arnold schwarzenegger nhow about satan nin my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons terminator nand that is schwartzeneggers strength muscles and no emotions nhere he tries to achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar nthis is called an adult turn if successful and flop if unsuccessful nmake wild guess nhis character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems nthis requires at least some acting skills nregrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles nthe rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters nthe movie is otherwise technically impressive with solid cinematography and fine lighting nbut the movie does nt serve neither as serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone nthe only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry nthe action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular nso really have hard time recommending this film to somebody nunless you are diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away nas for schwarzenegger hell be back
bit stands as moment one will not soon forget giant green ogre flips through the pages of cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema page of this tale serves as that ogres toilet paper nfrom this opening moment one can infer shreks defying of all expectations regarding it as standard disneyesque fairy tale nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds position of absolute nothingness within his community nthe jolly green giant meets fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for good portion of time shrek eventually comes to mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from castle guarded by dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite bit about each other and themselves along the way ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkeys immeasurable cowardice reveals itself nwhether he encounters walking over shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without selfacknowledgment nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant firebreathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them nsecondly upon shreks and donkeys redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for human knight in shining armor nthroughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets hisher mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist nafter the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance nsurprisingly fiona holds dark secret of her own due to spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night nin this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as ones self nupon fionas learning of shreks desire to pursue relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of selfridicule and hatred nany child can pull from fionas transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of selfacceptance non the technical side shrek triumphs ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona nmyers creates his shrek as lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the highstrung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princessogre sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding

for the ages
bi feel no hesitation in saying that there something about mary is the best film that will see all year nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture there was no doubt in my mind that had seen masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of nit is that good of film nwhen gene siskel said this about fargo only few months into dismissed the notion as ridiculous nhow could you possibly know that film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it nbut after seeing the farrellys hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork now know what siskel was talking about nonce in very great while film comes along that is so daring so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end you just want to stand up and cheer nand you know at that instant that you have just experienced something very special nnow for the shocker mary is the grossest and most disgusting film have ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding nthe movie is so rude and guess inappropriate in nature that had hard time sitting in theater watching it with my parents luckily had seen it before them so could warn the about what they were in for nforget blazing saddles animal house and even the former king of grossout comedy monty pythons meaning of life they were all only preludes to the farrellys assault on the senses nin fact this may even be the funniest film ve ever had the pleasure of seeing the only real contender is monty python and the holy grail and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade nbut as funny as it is something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of mary it has huge heart nyou see the farrellys are truly gifted filmmakers nthey do nt just present you with string of dick and fart jokes although there are plenty to go around nthey also very wisely add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses nits funny though nif you just look at an outline of the story it seems kind of contrived and predictable nbut believe me it is anything but nben stiller plays ted very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe mary cameron diaz nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother warren nearly brown the cameraman believe it or not from scream his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom nin one of the films funniest scenes something goes wrong wo nt ruin it for those who know nothing about the film and ted is unable to face mary ever again njump to the present nafter years of selfloathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy suitably slimy matt dillon to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school nhealy finds that mary is still fullblown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself nadmittingly the basic story line leaves little to be desired nafter all with notreallyallthatfunny premise how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours nsomehow the farrellys pull it off nthe performances here are also right on target nas ted stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating as he would normally be but very lovable nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons but the actor who really grabs your attention is earl brown as marys brother nno other actor has even come close to playing mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here ni know he wo nt be nominated but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february nas good as the actors are though its the directors movie all the way ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielbergs wwii epic saving private ryan nand yes that is great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting nbut which is harder making great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they ca nt breath for minutes at time nill let you decide that one for yourself but this critic is sticking to his guns nthere is just something about mary

bthe start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate npeople are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future nafter sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds nthe basic idea behind the movie is that every once in while make that every years or so an evil force comes to destroy earth nthe things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element nthe plot in this movie really is nt that important to the thing though nthis movie has very good special effects for the most part nthe technoish music in the background fits the mood very well nbruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in futuristic new york city none day lady draped with few bandages drops down into his trunk nthis movie is about what happens nthe plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with variety of different locations nalso there is fair bit of action in the film particularly towards the end nsome characters are just plain strange including highlyenergetic deejay in drag nbruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does nthe movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down nit is one of those scifi films where you ll be saying cool followed by what the hell ni give the fifth element

bthe king and warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of woman who challenges the heart of king with obvious results nwhen anna miranda richardson british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the kings martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler nmeanwhile the kings prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne nthe last and most predictable main subplot deals with the kings son allen hong and his love for servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of journal ni will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail nthe screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc would cringe nliterally nspeaking of cringing did quite bit of this during the rather short film which is classic display of terrible filmmaking nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical nthe sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to nunlike disney animated features the king and is songs do nt add to the film and are as uneffective as could be ntake the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst nyoure being hunted by dragon nwhat do you do nsing happy song nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives do nt make positive nbelieve it nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses nno personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end nand where does this characters personality change nhey thought anna was supposed to change him nisnt that the whole plot nthe prime ministers hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no nanother one of his teeth fell out nhardyharhar nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five would have cringed while watching him nby the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why hate this movie because the king and is disgrace to animation nanimated films such as the lion king and the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds ni have not read the play or seen the oscar winning film adaption but from what can tell the screenplay for the version completely butchers the play for the king and is never magical nor interesting nif it was nt for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and could earn the title worst movie of the decade ninstead the king and will just go down as among the years worst nthe bottom line avoid this movie at all costs nnot even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it nnot the slightest bit

ba life less ordinary while the extremely peculiar life less ordinary does live up to its title more appropriate moniker would be movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge nat the core of this strange film is fairly basicand yes ordinarypremise nafter robert boyle regular ewan mcgregor an aspiring writer of trashy novels is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation he kidnaps navilles ian holm spoiled daughter celine cameron diaz and holds her for ransom nthe joke here is that celine is willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme teaching the inept robert thing or two about kidnapping nand ultimately did nt we see this one coming nlove nso far so mediocre nbut mediocre is better than dreadful which this film is thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance nit turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth so the chief of heavens police gabriel dan hedaya dispatches two angels oreilly holly hunter and jackson delroy lindo to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status nthis conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture nbut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film as it stands it is simply waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand nnot that there is much of romance to begin with ntry as diaz and mcgregor may celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters nceline is rich bitch robert is dullard nas such it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again they never seem to really connect with each other nwhen celine and robert start to overtly act on their feelings it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural nbut am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance honestly am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish nboyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz but it remains just thatenergy not energy in service of story or even acting nthe cast seems lost especially hunter whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling nand then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film some violent confrontations involving the angels who are not exactly angelicin fact they end up staging their own ransom scheme some mystical hokum in the climax and cutesy claymation epilogue nwatching much of life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell stockpiling quirks in the name of cool ninstead the film just gives quirky bad name nmy best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic yes misspelling intended whimsy which comes through in only one scene an extended musical number where celine and robert sing beyond the sea at karaoke bar nafter verse or two the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos and engage in spirited dance routine on the counter nthe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard just relying on the innate charm of the leads allowing them to build romantic rapport nalas not nearly enough is built for this moment comes to an abrupt end ni applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill na life less ordinary certainly delivers something different but by the time the film was over was clamoring for life more ordinary can accept failure neveryone fails at something nbut ca nt accept not trying nit does nt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart nmichael jordan
bdenzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances nthis perhaps may be washingtons very best to date nhe joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent this season to become his character copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly nhis very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting the hurricane much better film than it actually is nwhen his rubin hurricane carter feels pain and is tormented by racism he creates for the audience great sense of sympathy disgust and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices nthe horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place few decades ago nthe powerful expressions of denzel washington alone as his tortured carter sum up the troubles of racism in americas history nhe is that amazing nthe problem with the hurricane is that when compared to washington all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles nmainly because the script focuses so much on carter that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors nthis is without doubt washingtons movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars ndenzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance nas rubin carter we see black man whose existence has been punching bag for the white american court system nfrom the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to juvenile prison for crime he did not commit nthen after successful marriage and boxing career he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for triple murder ncarters second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous powerful white men who refused to let him succeed nfrom these past experiences in jail carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america nafter several court appeals an autobiography and many public marches for his freedom carter remained locked in prison nit was not until young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carters book in the that serious battle for freedom took place nthe young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released nthe greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation nwashington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career nthe devastation in washingtons eyes show man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it nin the hole carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he can not nhis anger is heightened to point of no control nwe see multiple carters violent angry one silent passive one and mediator nwe see an emotional boxing match inside carters head nfrom this point in the hole to the end of the film this fight continues nit is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite nwhen carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison the angry carter at first erupts nwhite people have been trying to hurt him his whole life this reminder leads to anger in his head nhowever as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him nhe realizes that society is changing nthat racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become part of this world nvery rarely have seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here nif only the other actors had this same determination ndan hedaya ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around nit felt like his character was taken straight out of scooby doo episode he would have gotten away with it if it was nt for those annoying little kids the kids in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable nthe lawyers who help release carter also are underused as is clancy brown as kind prison guard the complete opposite of his character in shawshank redemption nthere is great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears nhedaya was superb in clueless same for david paymer in get shorty harris yulin in ghostbusters and liev schreiber in the daytrippers nit is mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles non the other hand it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin hurricane carter nthis role is about as far off from shallow as you can get

bback in chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films nhe could nt of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shootem up and beatem up genre aficionados nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the bmovie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products nthe hitman action thriller directed by chucks brother aaron is one of the last among them nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead by his partner which should nt surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters nsurviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this film should have been action nwell the action in this film falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films nwe know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension nin the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade nduring the film somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris nthat caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation nthe photography in this film is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it
bwhen saw the trailer for the sixth sense did nt expect much from it nmy snap judgment was that it was watereddown version of the shining or possibly lateentry in the glut of angelrelated moviestv shows of couple years ago nbut all the buzz motivated me to give it shot nit turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe nat the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlbergformer new kidin an impressive cameo na year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed ncole sear haley joel osment is withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood nweird things seem to happen around colehis mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole has nt movedand cole seems to know things that kid his age shouldntfor example that there was once gallows in his school nhe steals religious icons from churches to build chapel in pup tent in his bedroom nthe trailer gave away the movies first major plot twist nif it had nt the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we would nt know what wrong with cole nif you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense nanyway since the trailer gave it away figure its fair game to discuss here nonce malcolm gains coles trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere ndead people wander around not knowing that they re dead invisible to everyone except cole nmalcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth nthe box office success of the sixth sense has generated lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that so ni hate to burst anybodys bubble but the sixth sense is nt really horror film nat its core the sixth sense is touching story of how troubled kid and an emotionallyscarred adult help each other to move past their problems nsome scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though none that really got to me the ghost of boy says to cole ill show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head nosment gives the best performance ve ever seen from child actor nits hard enough to find grownup in hollywood who can give subtle realistic portrayal nalthough willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life nif only willis work were as impressive naccustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date this is bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of marriage nwriterdirector night shyamalan has light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite nhes also skillful storyteller as the movies ending demonstrates nonly when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie nlook for cameo by the director as doctor who treats cole nbottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie
bit happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters nthis years crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world nthe marketing blitz in has been centered on godzilla heeere leezerd leezerd which does nt make me optimistic about future summers ngodzilla is of course based on series of cult movies translation really bad movies only few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations nthat this bigbudget remake wo nt rise above its roots is fairly obvious nthe credits show us the origin of godzilla nin five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard nsounds like an enquirer headline

footprint nevery disaster movie has to have knowitall scientist and this time broderick is it nas the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms and would nt you love to have that printed on your business card nbroderick is invaluable to the government nhe immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is dinosaur because hey you ca nt take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members nbroderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is radiated lizard the radiation is nt an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes believe this is mutated

broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp ngodzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day so it has lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots nlook no further than patillos betrayal of broderick patillo what have done animal nwhat have become and the climactic godzillas nest sequence in madison square garden nthe main difference is independence day was about the experience nit had real global patriotic element to it and some genuinely fun characters ngodzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna nyes bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla nthat fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
good will hunting is two movies in one an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and traditional hollywood prodigy child film complete with upbeats downfalls sporadically moving situations and plenty plenty of shtick nunusually directed by gus van sant good will hunting overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh new talent nthe film stars matt damon as will hunting as mathematical rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by college professor stellan skarsgard who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams nin nutshell that it nthe core of the good will hunting is damon who infuses the script co written by chasing amys ben affleck with just the right amount of warmth sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as refreshing multi talented performer nbut its the acting that hits the mark and damon hits all the right notes flying over robin williams dejavu role awakenings was written all over this as devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wifes tragic death ndamon effortlessly blends the carelesness of gregarious confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein nhis rich complex character is the pulp of good will hunting neverything else pales in comparison good will hunting exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling but unlike little man tate or phenomenon it does nt set up its story in black and white point to point be manner but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success does nt automatically signify he must make easy familiar choices like the protagonists in the aforementioned
bperhaps its time for me to say little about my reading habits ni really do like to read and ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime nmy problem is that slow reader and not very dedicated ill enjoy portions of book and then set it down for months at time its taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though loving the book nin addition to this typically do nt read anything created after the th century nthe only reason bother with this bit of information is because feel bad admitting time after time that have nt read any of the books on which these films are based the only exception believe is great expectations nhowever do nt think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film nneedless to say have nt read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on which steven soderberghs new film is based ni ca nt say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up to leonards vision ni can say that its terrific film with sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh nits certainly nice distraction from lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered nout of sight proves that it does nt ni had originally written george clooney off as onenote actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing little flair nafter seeing his latest performance in this film ve changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those million superstars nhere he plays jack foley middle aged guy who robs banks for living nhe does it because its fun think but the film opens with him getting caught because his car wo nt start nhe goes to jail which is interesting only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend buddy ving rhames nwere then introduced to karen sisco jennifer lopez marshall who conveniently is waiting with shotgun as jack escapes nfortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence and since this is gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise nat first kind of felt that it was gimmick but guess it was gimmick in pulp fiction too nits fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally nive only seen few of soderberghs films was impressed both with kafka and sex lies and videotape but think he excellent at what he does nhes an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious which is always admirable nhe uses tricks yes lots of freezeframe stuff here but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film nas said clooney is terrific and he matched by lopez nlopez is of course beautiful but she can act too ni can sense that she honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome uturn nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another the best scene in the film by far is the seduction scene nthe brilliance of this scene is also due in part to soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in bar to the physical act which takes place few minutes later nthe scene is series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing nthe supporting cast is strong led by the alwaysreliable ving rhames ndennis farina who plays karens father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain nsteve zahn who plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and that in film where every scene is already at high level nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligentlyconstructed script by scott frank nout of sight is certainly light film although there are few heavy moments that will linger in the memory noverall can recommend it simply as great entertainment nnot every film has to change your life and its nice to see movie that uses the art to tell great story and simply to entertain its viewers nas for the book this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at

bfantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen nthe film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about years old doing some research in chernobyl nsome shady government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like giant lizard nand what more this beast is heading for new york ngulp nalthough godzilla should be non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie nthe main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies nbroderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or tough guy image nwhile emmerichs previous summer flick independence day had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither nalso maria pitillo as brodericks former girlfriend is just as useless with chronic disability in acting nshes incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she total crap nits up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in campy performance as french secret agent nshame he has such little screen time in such overlong film nhank azaria also turns up as crazy cameraman named animal and he adds little life to the picture nalso making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as slimy news reporter no so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies nbut what about the script nwell that not up to par either nemmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write script nthe dialogue is banal broderick looks at lot of fish and utters that lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant nbroderick forever remains geeky scientist nalso the film is seriously lacking sense of humour nthe jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene nha ha ha ha nthe plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park by having lots of baby godzillas nvelicorapters running around new york nright so the script and acting suck nbut what about the special effects nthankfully they re are quite good ngodzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we do nt see much of him because the movie is so dark nthe destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell nbut although they are impressive they ca nt save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie nthe movie goes on for far too long aswell and it ca nt seem to decide on ending nand of course the ending itself leaves possibility for sequel nlets just hope one never arrives
bbeing that it is foreign language film with no known names with select number theaters showing it shall we dance wo nt be seen by that many people nand that shame this is funny enchanting and goofy movie full of laughs surprises and wonderful dance sequences nthe surprising thing about shall we dance is the universal appeal of the story na us version is in the works and its no wonder its not really all that culture specific nalthough there is narrated setup that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer is nt at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film nthe only important unexplained japanesespecific reference that may leave some bit puzzled is that yen is roughly when you see the film and you should see this film you ll know why na middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life house child and good marriage still does nt translate into fulfilled life nafter glimpsing melancholy beauty looking out from dance studio window while on the train home from work sugiyana koji yakusho decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself nafter finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai tamiyo kusakari too rich for his blood sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her nwe then meet the players in this gem of movie who all have their own reasons for joining the class nlater on we meet aoki at the dance studio naoto takenaka coworker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film nthe story laughs and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along nits pleasure to watch such wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances nits difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters and in the end each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater nits one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore no big plot no special effects no gunplay no tragic consequences no forced examinations of the nature of love and no insights into the nature of evil njust warm funny endearing film that will charm the pants off of you nwhen was the last time you left theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside shall we dance will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste
bin intolerance griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one to the other neach of the stories builds to fastpaced climax nin magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized neach story builds to tense moment or what appears to be intended to be tense moment but then lets the tension dissolve nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing song and in each plotline the major characters sing along even though they are not in the same scene nthen toward the end the stories each build to tense moment again nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked nthis creates some strange effects nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content nwe have the story of dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends nphil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal npartridges young wife linda julianne moore is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies but for an unsuspected reason nfrank mackey tom cruise runs the kinds of selfhelp seminar that businesses like so much but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shitheels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to womens lib nofficer jim kurring john reilly is patrolman who has need to feel he is making the world better place njimmy gator philip baker hall hosts popular childrens tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman and former quiz kid donnie smith william macy nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily neach story moves toward single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history but it really has little to do with the content of the stories though they all are connected in part by one weird event nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous films hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from andersons company njohn reilly seems to be standard fixture nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following nas wellrounded stories with beginning middle and end they leave something to be desired nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through ni rate it on the to scale and low on the to scale nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen nand in actual fact it does nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods nit is however perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are nwhen the whirlwind is over water animals near the surface frequently fish and frogs may suffer the same fate nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind held aloft by updrafts and finally dropped elsewhere nso while the rain is possible some doubts do creep in nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than had pictured for rain of frogs nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon frankly have no idea on these points notherwise the event was quite believable nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is sign from god since there are many references to exodus and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants nhowever rain of frogs though it feels biblical is most definitely not biblical portent nnote that the previous verse says and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up nso the bible is referring not to rain but to an infestation from the river nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as symbol for uncleanness in revelation
bforgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects nset in at salem massachusetts the crucible opens with group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around boiling cauldron in the middle of forest under the glow of full moon nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor daniel day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes chicken beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account surely this chickenbashing bit is bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibilities nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to coven of witches as it gets nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play nthis is far from harmless event bad start to an already shaky morality tale nthe play describes the films opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this adds to the plays charged atmosphere nin the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandoras box nnot only is credulity stretched but abigails obsession is unfortunately spotlighted nit positions the crucible more as cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts it will bring back the memory of rabbit boiling away in pot nnot surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning witches are invoked by those eager to blame nwhen the girls are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses led lustfully by abigail nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonallyadvantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents constant reminders that abigails passion sets all this into inexorable motion nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctors love his wife elizabeth joan allen by including her among those accused of witchcraft nappropriately narrowwaisted and equipped with distractingly white smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to murky yellow day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an overearnestness that longs to be watched ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foamingmouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on pedestal for our admiration notherwise hytners direction is unremarkable nryders performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character na scene near the end featuring private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed nunfortunately when johns audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost nit is clear that miller meant well but do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message nthe result is clumsy muddle felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavyhanded to be wholly believable nwhen the gallows beckoned it was sweet release indeed nfar from bewitching the crucible tests the patience
bwith his last two films shine and snow falling on cedars australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different nits structure beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle is similar to the green mile which is bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books nthe parallels do nt end there either natlantis was adapted by william goldman who had previously penned the bigscreen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for kings dreamcatcher neven the films content is bit reminiscent of mile nin fact its the perfect blend of the feelgood nostalgia of stand by me also by king and mystical power hokum of mile nkings atlantis is book comprised of five related short stories but the main focus here is on the first and longest tale called low men in yellow coats the films title comes from the second chapter nits set in harwich connecticut where yearold bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in boarding house run by his cold selfcentered mother elizabeth hope davis joe goulds secret who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar and tomboy carol gerber mika boorem who become something like the kevin paul and winnie of harwich nwhen new tenant moves into the vacant room the fatherless bobby finds male role model in ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobbys mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature after his cheapskate mother gives him library card for his birthday dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers ni wo nt go into what these powers are but they re considerably toned down from the book and do nt involve black stuff flying out of teds mouth la mile natlantis presentday setting which bookends the film is based on the novels final chapter titled heavenly shades of night are falling and features david morse in yet another connection to the green mile as married middleaged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski the oscarnominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowskis red nthe acting is solid from everyone including hopkins who never once makes you think of dr lecter nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem who both had tiny parts in along came spider nwhile did nt really have much of problem with goldmans screenplay do need to point out at least one inconsistency ngoldman for those of you who do nt read premiere writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody elses films carefully explaining why they all suck make no sense and insult their audiences while somehow failing to mention the crap that he penned like the generals daughter nits meanspirited but fun to read mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business including michael jackson nand robert blake nin atlantis which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back nwell he not and it does nt make sense pg for violence and thematic elements
btheres scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy nthis is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since its totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film nits like they took the subgenre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters nyes the poseidon adventure is crap but its fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters nand earthquake my god earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold volcano takes semiintriguing yet stupendously inane plot volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only nits in dare say it nl and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it ntheyre just stupid nand the actors are all good ones ntommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and member of the men in black my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer nanne heche is good indy actress ndon cheadle stole the disappointing devil in blue dress from denzels feet nand gabys one of the few good teenage actors nbut they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what going on nthey do their best god bless them but they re all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he the greatest part of the film ntheres no real suspense here cause you do nt care about anyone ni actually was rooting for gabys character to get killed so tommy lee jones would nt have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times nand there are no interesting sites in that we see get destroyed npart of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever nin independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens nthat was cool nwatching really fakelooking magma plow down the street is not nokay so the films not devoid of merit nas already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best nand there this really moronic scene which looks cool njohn carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it nhe has one guy who wounded and could make it nhe could throw the guy and jump and still survive nbut no nhe has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava nheres the cool sight he melts nheres the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting ncool sight nno logic nbut cool sight nthe volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there nthey are nt worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes nbut to tell the truth was glad they did nt go on ni was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended nmy god it was actually painful to sit through this little minute long film ni have nt seen dantes peak but ve heard its masterpiece compared to this nif you want to see cool disaster flick that inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent nsimpson he saves cat nif you want to waste your time watching boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this nbut warned you

bmany people will not find much to like in what dreams may come the new film by visionary director vincent ward nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors nbut little do they know as so plainly found out that this has quite complex story to tell nwalking out of the theater could see the audiences disgust none member even had to be awakened after the film ended ndont believe the previews that you see nthis is definitely not film for everyone nthis is quite possibly one of the most adultoriented films to come out in recent years nkids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline nthe plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us nit goes back and forth in time as if it has no boundaries nthink of the film city of angels nnow add more complex screenplay and more unique vision nboth films deal with the afterlife but doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office ncosting around million to make the film would have to do extremely well in order to make its money back nbut due to its story doubt it will nfor everyone who thought titanics story was too simple and cliche here is proof that if james cameron had written more complex screenplay it may not have done nearly as well nbut do nt get me wrong ni hope the film does do well nits vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place even in our own mind nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city nfull of rich shocking colors we get to see heaven that most of us would probably die to get to nbut do nt do that because you ll end up going to hell nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on lake nchris christy nielsen robin williams is startled by the sudden jolt but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat nannie annabella sciorra spies chris as well and both eventually bond and get married nannie is an artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic nchris is doctor and loves annie more than life itself nthey also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock nbut one day the two children are killed in car crash and it almost destroys annie nshe tries to commit suicide but fails and is then put in an institution nchris copes with the problem by realizing they are nt around anymore and nothing will change that njust as annie gets her life back in order chris is killed while trying to save the life of car crash victim nchris goes to heaven or his version of heaven rather nguided by albert cuba gooding jr chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy nthat is until he realizes how miserable he is without annie nprior to heaven he would try to comfort annie but the more he was around the more pain she felt nchris decides to leave her alone nlittle does he realize what will happen next nim not about to say because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story many critics however give it away ncertainly chris dying is crucial to the plot but they tell you that he dies in the previews nstory is not necessarily important for this movie to work because it deals with the afterlife nhowever strangely virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil na couple of comments here and there but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life were soul mates nchris exclaims nheaven in movies is almost always depicted as glowing city of white purity and love nusually it also looks like it rests among the clouds nbut what dreams may come goes different route nit shows us heaven that most of us have never seen before nchris heaven is his memories brought to life nhis thoughts can make anything real and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven ve never seen anyone use real paint before albert says nequally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone ninstead its state of being nin one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive at sea of faces nthousands of heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else nmostly dead silent some quips are made almost as if to lighten the mood nits truly frightening sequence nproduction designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination nusing state of the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration nsometimes some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact nits not necessary to be there but we appreciate seeing it ncostume designer yvonne blake who also appears in the film has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes ncinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove has difficult job as most cinematographers do working with special effects nbut serras entire universe is computer generated image and he does masterful job nwriter ron bass adapting from the novel by richard matheson provides very fluid screenplay with no real set plot nthe story is extremely vague in its details allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning nand director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision nwhat dreams may come is good example of german expressionism which may just turn off good portion of the audience nyour average movie goer more than likely is nt used to expressionistic techniques nthe film will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they should nt take it too far nit is after all just movie nrobin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering nhis comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff but when is confined by screenplay he is nt quite as effective nbut drama is really his strong point and you can see that here nits doubtful hell get another oscar nomination but would nt really mind if he did nthe real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land nthis may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention nits also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination nhowever the academy does nt like to award performances for these types of films ncuba gooding jr has been better but he certainly not distracting nmax von sydow is underused as are jessica brooks and josh paddock na treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear if they even recognize him as chris father lost in the sea of faces nits not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images noverall its williams and sciorras film nwhat dreams may come is rated pg for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity nthe film is definitely aimed at more adult audience nsome will find the plot distracting nsome will find the visuals absolutely glorious nand some will find both nthe only real problem with the film that could see was that it slows down considerably during the midsection just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins nby the way some controversy even surrounded the title which was mistaken for sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand nin actuality the title is from soliloquy in hamlet njust thought should let you know
bit would be hard to choose the best american political thriller nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may nboth those films were tense exercises in chills nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer nbut that was and respectively nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed neach of those films had memorable characters and tense plot nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay nthe thrills all came from the plot nronin is like film made by another man nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it nwe get clue here and one there as to what is going on but zeiks screenplay is bit obscure nthe film begins explaining that ronin is masterless samurai nwhen samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes ronin much like gunfighter in the american west nif you miss the opening do not worry nthis film will explain again what ronin is nsam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of ronin nhe is free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of professional killer nhe clearly was in dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france nsam is recruited from montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal mysterious metal case ndierdre is very tightlipped about what is in the case nsam joins team of four others vincent jean reno of the professionalleon and mission impossible spence sean bean tvs richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting nalso along is larry skipp suddeth nthe group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team nthe story is not very easy to follow nit is never clear who is doublecrossing whom and who is working for whom nsomehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on certain metal case nsome very good actors are involved in this film none wonders what they saw in the script nthe characters are mostly onedimensional professional killers nthey know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal nas revival of sort of action film that was popular in the was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy nunfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it ni rate ronin on the to scale and on the to scale nnonspoiler incidentally the tale of the ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the ronin nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of man breaking down door with huge mallet nthis is the first blow of the ronin

bmm written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become bog standard murder mystery nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles who is asked by upper class toff mrs christian myra carter to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe nthe movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed nall mrs christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not nwelles agrees and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies with video clerk max california phoenix as his guide nalthough the snuff industry has nt really been examined in mainstream cinema mm still makes rather plodding thriller which just seems to be bit sicker than most nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away nmm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much and apart from few moments most of the action in the film is nothing you have nt seen from another standard thriller nthe cast help towards the entertainment apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ever since leaving las vegas cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot such as in the terrible snake eyes nhere in mm he boring uninteresting and has dull monotonous voice nand in this overlong thriller these virtues do not help keep the suspense up nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving as phoenix is true talent nhis performance is great break away from the gloom and he just purely enjoyable to watch ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife although she delivers far better performance than her character deserves nher character though is hugely underwritten one of the most wasted characters of the year nalso fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director nas this film is written by the person behind seven mm is filled with doom and gloom and noone appears to know how to use an light switch nunlike seven mm is nt too clever and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives nlacking the strong characters seven featured mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment nbut director joel schumacher the completely wrong guy for the job puts style over content and while the direction and look are good its just not very disturbing nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry it does nt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind which misses the point nalso the last minutes are so hackneyed so cliched its amazing to think its the same film you re watching nmm is far from an success snuffed opportunity nwith boring lead character controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial and director obsessed with looks what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is dumb thriller nultimately mm is probably worth renting on home video unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like nand trust me the rest of the hours are not worth it

spawn may be somewhat of an older film nin fact it will probably be on video before anyone who has nt seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it nbut managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing nit was nt the worst film of year by any means nit is nt even on the top of the worst films of the year nbut it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of list nthe only reason it does nt come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year nperformances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy nin fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness neven the editing seemed to boast campy quality ni do nt know how to explain that one it was nt exactly choppy but something about it seemed nwell annoyingly unprofessional njohn leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite nhe is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional nbut the main problem found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring ni would nt even say there was climax to the film nsure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing conclusion nnever too soon the movie did conclude in very simple disappointing way neven though its one of the shorter movies ve seen this year its one that would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again nlike said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small ni was impressed with the opening sequence so long as did nt allow the melodramatic voiceover and lobotomizing editing to get to me nand batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawns outfit created nbut even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite bit like modern video game nwho knows if spawn the video game was nt part of the plan from the beginning nkeeping in mind that the film was based on comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all nbut none of this movies saving graces can it make it something recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission nthis movie is definitely not for young children which should nt really be problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing nif you really want to catch movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be ntrust me spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nlike its own opening shot from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as bonafide major talent na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of troupe in the adult film industry boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking nthe film follows softspoken young man eddie adams mark wahlberg from torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom and later to harrowingly precipitous drop nas boogie nights opens he toiling as dishwasher in trendy san fernando valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity nrecruited by fatherly jack horner rejuvenated burt reynolds successful porn filmmaker eddie abandons his old life in favour of new one as dirk diggler pornstar nwholeheartedly embraced by jacks troupe including the maternal amber waves julianne moore reed rothchild john reilly buck swope don cheadle rollergirl heather graham dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled to the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being big bright shining star nhis lack of discipline however incites chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as new decade is ushered in nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr anderson whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows female partygoer diving into pool mr andersons accomplished command of the camera is without question nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating impertinent and selfcongratulatory case in point marc roccos unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent nits rarity and delight to discover such confidently assured work so early in filmmakers career boogie nights is only his second feature film following up his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although its somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman while in terms of visuals he clearly influenced by martin scorsese at least he borrowing from some of the best and its entirely effective within the context of this film nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value its also rollicking good fun with wickedly deadpan sense of humour nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited freewheeling lifestyles abounded nwhile much of the films humour pertains to the characters obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society prime example is parttime salesman buck swopes demo of stereo system with an eighttrack tape and inviting prospective customer to get freaky deaky with the music its elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous na giant ensemble disco dance production number in nightclub is funny to be sure but oddly magical and the sequence which lovingly explores eddiedirks bedroom completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic figures farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee is breathtaking nably supported by wellselected collection of period music all of which purportedly came straight from mr andersons personal collection there clear affection for the era in boogie nights nits the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the films promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters nafter the debacle with milos forman film the people vs nlarry flynt another finelycrafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline the new line marketing team faced unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public nhowever while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago its hardly lurid or seamy film given the subject matter there very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as hotbed of carnality but simply as business nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horners shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate there candid matteroffactness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing job and its refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided nif anything boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves njack horners dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires to make great film and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood albeit lacking certain wistful innocence nin both films the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jacks retort of there are shadows in light baby to his cinematographers complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed woods its not about the little details its about the big picture nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan from outer space appears patently false nin boogie nights and ed wood the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove to be bemusing not in their intentions there nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged after viewing hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this is the best work ve ever done its genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses tinge of sadness nmr anderson is at this point clearly greater talent as director than screenwriter nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging there really is nt any clever dialogue in the film though valid point certainly can be made that none of the films characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the films protagonist literally does nt say single insightful thing throughout the entire minute running time its no wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the films finest exchanges nand while mr anderson creates rich collection of fascinating characters its problematic that some of the the threads given to the films characters are simply stale material julianne moores child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her characters story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions nstill even if he does nt always know what to do with his characters mr anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive selfdestructive insufferable loved them just the same nin any case its hard to pick nits with screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately bestexecuted scenes of the year scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loosecannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance even if its small one in suicidal drug deal scam only to find that the millionaire is crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night rangers sister christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked by an armed bodyguard nif this scene already was nt tense enough with these elements mr anderson introduces chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene to new surreal level of delightful giddiness nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights nmr anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect nsimilarly painful scene where crew member scotty philip seymour hoffman breaks down in tears in the drivers seat sobbing so stupid after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as later scene with dirk in the drivers seat after particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise to the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and mr reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film ringing true in every respect handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention nmr reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbards georgia genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film nim not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character to tee nmr reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and its wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during macho altercation nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down numbingly bad and deadon period it sure sounds like bad early to me demo track you got the touch in vain attempt at musical career nmr reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective nms graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like disney animated heroine come to life or in this case disney animated heroine who came to life made wrong turn and ended up on the new line lot in film focused on the late early adult film industry nconsequently its bit incongruous to see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in scene where she lounging in limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera hilariously pouty comehither look all one can do is gulp nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out err in figurative sense she essentially glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity if only mr anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though nand cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as teen ms grahams parents forbade her to take part in the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been as junkie gus van sants drugstore cowboy and now porn starlet ndraw your own conclusions nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr cheadle who lends dignity to his role as character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested by series of changes in his sense of fashion nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st vincent an interesting melora walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible its no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry nwhile the scenario is familiar the wounded look in cheadles eyes makes the scene unforgettable nluis guzmans most famous work is possibly in brian de palmas carlitos way and here he plays variation on the same character maurice rodriguez is hapless but goodnatured nightclub owner who hangeron to jacks group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack with little disguise made of his desperation for part in one of his erotic pictures njacks eventual acquiescence to maurices request leads to one of boogie nights biggest comic payoffs nboogie nights is stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as presence of note with this work nstriking fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally wellcrafted there no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year
bone of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself nsuch was the case with boxing helena directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch nmade in the dying years of posttwin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract nbut the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into welldeserved oblivion nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to reestablish the relationship nduring one of such occasions helena is hit by car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her nafter she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaughs stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping nshe is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms napart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch has nt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father ndespite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos nthe actors are nt good either njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic does nt suit him nbill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helenas boyfriend nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting could nt help this film nthe screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made bestseller with laura palmers diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion none of those subplots involves character of cavanaughs regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke nthe twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated nall in all boxing helena is disorganised quasiartistic mess of movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basingers career

ba fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july ni did nt really expect very much when rented stuart saves his family nthe movie bombed at the box office and had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based nmy real concern though was the general reputation of snlrelated movies translating to the big screen with lessthanstellar results halfbaked anyone ni was surprised to discover truly entertaining often hilarious yet also touching little film nit is an al franken production throughandthrough who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture nfor those of you who do nt know al franken plays guy named stuart smalley who has really annoying show on publicaccess station about increasing your selfesteem etc although not licensed therapist stuart smalley is as the program proudly boasts graduate of several step programs nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles nstuarts relatives are mess his dad and brother harris yulin and vincent donofrio respectively are alcoholics his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce and his mom is in constant selfdenial and solves all perceived problems by baking nthen disaster strikes nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself and there the comedy truly picks up nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes but as sharplydrawn real people nalthough smalleys dad has always imbibed too much stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy nalso after an accident towards the end of the movie both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought nalthough filled with small very funny scenes stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments especially towards the conclusion nfor lightweight comedy it handles these scenes especially well often better than many socalled serious dramas of today nall the more amazing is that such movie comes from saturday night live sketch that is essentially onejoke bit nif you feel like renting comedy and you have nt seen this film definitely recommend you try this one out nyoull laugh you ll ncry its nall there
love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes nat the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza who an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish relationship with an unsuspecting woman ndanza sets up double date with her her sister and collegue of his neverything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down set of stairs nmuch confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge all after one thing or another nsound confusing nit is ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in little humour and levity nin some respects it works nbut the majority of the film is convoluted and confusing mess ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur offscreen nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we do nt really care what happens to them nwell did nt at least none thing will give the movie is that its complete departure for tony danza nheres guy because of his many sitcom roles who ingrained in the consciousness as nice guy who always does the right thing nhere he plays man who just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it ni was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film had forgotten all about his goodguy persona nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him nlike said its not exactly linear storyline love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but its just too bad that the story does nt really add up to much nthe stars deserved better and so did the audience
bwhat look for in movie is not necessarily perfection nsometimes movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have will prefer it to bettermade film that is not as thoughtprovoking nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes nterence malick returns to filmmaking years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war nunlike this years saving private ryan which dwells on war as necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof the thin red line simply says war is waste nwhile that might seem obvious to some only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound waste it is nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has great cost the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs none message is not necessarily more correct than the other nit just depends on ones point of view nin malicks film war is set in tropical paradise and john tolls cinematography is beyond lush nthe setting poses the question why are we fighting in the face of such beauty nin saving private ryan the capture of german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go nin the thin red line the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place nthey are just like the americans frightened and angry grieving and praying nall that separates them is war nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voiceovers nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious sometimes corny the voiceovers tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary ndispensing with them malick could have achieved tarkovskian grandeur ninstead he gets distracting selfconsciousness naside from that malicks direction is stunning nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary nsean penn elias koteas and nick nolte give the best performances npenn is subtle as sergeant trying to hide his humanism koteas is genuine as compassionate captain and nolte startling as colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he can not win his battle njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles nultimately however the thin red lines interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure but malick clearly has different things on his mind nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative nwhat malick is working with is theme and in that the thin red line is most provoking

bthe police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do nlives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at moments notice nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower nmost of all the negotiator must be able to enter situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants nit takes pretty smart person to do that nbut what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart nwhat if he also able to think on his feet nin fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for gary grays the negotiator nin this film police negotiator danny roman samuel jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the media roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office ni do nt quite remember if the captain actually said hate to do this but nalthough it would nt surprise me if he did nluckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above nafter being offered takeitorleaveit deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum nwalsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed nalthough romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational buildup gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue njackson while superb actor is miscast in the role of roman nthe actor has become so popular and so often identified as protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have difficult time believing he will carry out his threats nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence nhow can we believe he going to shoot hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier nunfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of its wouldbe suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability nalmost every time he in scene jackson steals it without looking back nwhen spacey appears the film has already run about third of its course nhis is an interesting character nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but ca nt talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says nwhen he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be nsoon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor nas the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely ngray really lucked out with this cast ndavid morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the nin confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land nwith the level of acting however this can be forgiven nalso in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides nhis character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything nfortunately this does nt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout nj walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances nsadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon nfor one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in few good men nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing nin the end the negotiator has plotline that parallels its reality nwere served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best nas an audience were also given situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into movie and we like to see if one will dominate the film nboth provide some pretty good entertainment
bscream like its predecessor is genrecrossing film nit is about horror film and murder mystery nthe mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time nscream was also known for its selfreferential tone nmany inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven nagain scream follows suit with characters saying such things as sequels suck and the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels nscream story is very similar to its predecessors nsidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college ngale weathers courteney cox has written book about the murders and that book is now being released as feature film called stab which for all practical purposes is the realworld movie scream nat the premiere of stab two students from sidneys college are stabbed to death and new story begins nthe press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer nthey want to know all about the links between stab sidney and the recent murders nthe most complex selfreference saw this should be an olympic event was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at press conference nthe rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers nthe other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press nthe audience was watching the whole filmed scene whew nthe movie is packed with layers and selfreferences that make it pleasure to watch neven better would be to watch double feature of scream and scream that not to say that these references necessarily make scream deep or even good movie nthe just add to the fun of watching it ni recommend it for other reasons as well nwhat liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural nno werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible nit is person in mask and robe his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims nno extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer nthe down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies you have less grounds to say its just movie nthe whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weathers and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down killer nthey are likeable but not outstanding nbut in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is perfect counterpoint nit was exactly year ago today that wrote the review for scream nthe internet movie database says that scream is in the works so wonder if ill be doing the same thing on january nif craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high ill be happy to mark my calendar

bnot great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie nearlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the years least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves nick real nsweet stuff nbut her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with film entitled battlefield earth ni seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on cheese factor as everybody and mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time nyipes another nbeauty nso what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with movie costarring the everversatile lisa kudrow nuhhhm you guessed it not nmuch nplot in order to escape major financial difficulties local weatherman hooks up with his ballpicking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery nbut as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand part of their winnings and more and more problems arise ncritique simply stated did nt laugh once during this entire picture nfor comedy it offered me few smiles bunch of nincompoops as characters miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tvs friends nthis film was not as disastrous as thought it would be but it was pretty close nthankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the films trailer and not in this final cut nand not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast nforemost was travoltas character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie nand for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong nhe did nt fit the part ni just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role na cool calculating roughneck with certain hip suave je ne sais quoi nin this film he looks like he trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good nwere not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case consider it wrong choice in casting nadd that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits nmichael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who is nt quite up at the same speed level as everyone else nand truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize nthe only real good thing that could say about this film is that its story was actually halfinteresting and never really bored me ni also liked michael moores perverted cousin character and loved and say it again loved the character that bill pullman played ngive this dude his own movie nhe played lazy cop man who tries everything not to do any real work nhe fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he wo nt have to fill out any forms now ntheres base of humor nsadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film nand there not much else can say about this movie folks non the whole it was lame included slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience nbut get somebody to write up movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and there

bplot something about bunch of kids going into haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and nonhorror movies noh yeah there also something about ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you wo nt care much about the plot in this film ncritique parody movies either work or they do nt and this one just does nt work nthe laughs are nt as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here nits like they were all in hurry to finish the film or something wink wink nand the scariest part of it all ncheck out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven ni say again it took seven people to write minutes worth of fart jokes halfassed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror nnow not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live nthere are couple of funny oneliners but mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes lot of dead silence and lame gags nadd to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you got ta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the films website is nt even up yet nwhat the ni do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist takeoff miss this and you ve missed any reason to see the flick ni especially liked his oneliner as he walked in to see the possessed womans head turning nvery funny nunfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude where my car and other action movies like charlies angels and mission impossible now help me figure this one out will you nisnt this supposed to be parody film of horror movies or maybe that just the title of the film fing with my head nwell sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lameass script nthe wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel nunfortunately for us all were left with here is skeleton of film which might ve been funny had it been worked over few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs nbut as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last years film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course nyou should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chopjob and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents npooh on you that telling em joblo nsheesh nbtw allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky gstring had me chompin at the bit nyou go girl neveryone else stay nwheres joblo coming from nairplane airplane ii galaxy quest hannibal the haunting mafia naked gun scary movie top secret
bugh that about sums this movie up njust ugh nthe original godzilla movies are somewhat of cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had certain degree of intelligence nand that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and man in lizard suit they maintained certain degree of how to put this ndignity nnot quite the word looking for nyou understand right nand in years godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever nleave it to america to screw the whole thing up nfrom the geniuses that brought us independece day arguably the worst scifi movie of all time to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had nwhile they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies storyline nsumming up the movie is simple nheck can do it in one sentence giant lizard attacks giant city and bunch of nobodies stop it nsimple as that nmatthew broderick stumbles over his lines and its hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dogwalking character on the television show mad about you nthe dialogue seems to be improvized almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all ni can see the scene on the set right now all right nwe spent all of this money making big special effects and we ve got ta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces nso you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head all right nmake up something mkay ngood nroll film nthe special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing and some of the cinemtography is welldone the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind nstill an hour into it you will become antsy wondering how long they can drag it out nand drag it out they do ni have to laugh nthe slogan for the film is size does matter ni think they cut this too short nit should read size does matter nacting does not
bironically one of the themes of cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life nunfortunately will no longer be able to say that lived every moment of my life to the fullest because spent otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for movie nactually smoking cigarettes in the same minutes could nt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie nnot only is it pathetically bad film overall but cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever nthe plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles home video nit is december and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house nbut no one has arrived yet nher invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues nit is up to those who are nt to help them come to terms nfirst there is eric brian mccardie who is former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof nhe is one of the most bland characters in film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical common trait of this poor production nbridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them nthey stumble across nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in film of imperfections nhe is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school nhis lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the substandard comedy nmoving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts nval is monicas cousin and true fan of the new york scene non the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just ca nt find nparadoxically it is punks that they meet at bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but are nt successful who guide them through their fears and force level of relaxation upon their warped minds nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches level of decency in both acting and plot nwisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship nhowever the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening nfinally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the film njack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy nvery often when film is as putrid as this production there will at least be decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory nhowever this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted ninstead what you get is collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies nfirst and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot nat other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot nthere are also at least scenes in taxi cab that go from start to finish nnot in single one of them does anybody pay the driver nand yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was ray of hope for these many bad plots nperhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even decent plot payoff at the end nbut it did nt happen that way nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight
bi did nt hate the big hit even though it is stupefyingly terrible film nfor the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and never once got bored ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such confused disaster of film that its entertaining to watch it in the same way that its entertaining to witness thirty car pileup on freeway spaghetti bowl nas narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries nit reminded me lot of grosse pointe blank which is similar film that fails in lot of the same ways nits fine to mix genres if the film makers know what they re doing nunfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong do nt seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be comedy nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place nbut it sure is fascinating failure nmarky ner mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley hitman nhes good hitman apparently although his tactics seem bit rambunctious he does nt snipe or make clean killshe just kicks the door down and shoots everything nhe works with few other hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr ntheyre nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex nthey all work for man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in nthey decide to kidnap young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has rich father nwhen they do this it turns out she is paris ngoddaughter nits very bad to have paris against you nthe story is standard action film stuff nits nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that its john wootype of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy nits true that lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as faceoff and the replacement killers which are both far superior nthere are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives nlike said its not boring most disasters are nt nwhat makes it so bad is its genreshifting madness nit seems to start out as quirkybutrealistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains nthen as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere nthen somewhere in between it turns back into comedy nkeiko turns out to be spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words nand scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator nthe scene is played for laughs but it is nt funny nand since it does nt quite work as comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails nthis is film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with handgun ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them ncharacters betray each other without second thought ngrenades are thrown in tight places npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive npeople outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds nmost frustrating of all though is the films definition of hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals ntheyre more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and handheld machineguns nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously does nt make for deep or interesting people to watch nthe acting is kind of fun thoughwahlberg is good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in silly sort of way nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvins fianc is convincingly airheaded nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and oneliners nits true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional ndespite all this though must reiterate the entertainment value here nyou can cherish the awfulness of film like this nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself

bgothic murdermystery yarns are not new conceit nin fact they ve been around in books and on film for many many years nwithout the proper handling they come off as oldfashioned bland and outdated the gift directed by sam raimi is triedandtrue effort that surprises very little and includes everything from wide array of suspects and red herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of waterlogged corpse found in nearby pond nits fairly obvious who the killer is in fact predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions nthe film ultimately should nt work but it does thanks to sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching

involved in fight at school she meets the niceguy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets negative vibe about nat party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole nsoon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home the gift may be cliched on sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film for love of the game lift the picture up several notches nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the minute mark divulges the movies true intentions and transforms the proceedings into taut at times frightening horrormystery nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than runofthemill protagonist into very exact downtoearth realistic person with valid troubles and caring attitude towards those around her nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as character and an actress nblanchett is nt the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year nin her first role following her oscar win for boys do nt cry hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie who seeks guidance from annie but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all to leave the grossly abusive donnie nas donnie keanu reeves the watcher makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all nfor the oftencriticized reeves whose acting abilities have never been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given ngiovanni ribisi the boiler room is heartbreaking as mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad nin the small but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king katie holmes wonder boys has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before and she is radiant in her few scenes nfinally kim dickens hollow man makes her usual strong impression as annies spicy best friend linda nthe other notable aspect of the gift is its moody atmosphere that lays such thickly foreboding air over every scene its almost suffocating nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and very good music score by christopher young the movie not only achieves scary undercurrent but one that is filled with dread nhelped along by strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast the gift is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills and offers up fair share of chills too nit may not be groundbreakingly original but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time
bcall for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings nwe will never have chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes nin gridlockd an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his costar tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry nshakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddies who share spoken wordjazz trio an apartment and drug addiction with cookie thandie newton nwhen new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time nthey soon make new years resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape nthe government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of drug dealer and on the run from nasty thug vondie curtis hall nin order for you to buy into gridlockd at all you have to accept it as surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new years day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all ngridlockd may actually be response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey falling down which found besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during trek through inner city los angeles nin falling down michael douglas dfens the characters personalized license plate echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord drepers plates whips out gun because he ca nt get breakfast at mcdonalds in gridlockd spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into rehab center nand where the unhinged dfens became heroic surrogate for audiences writerdirector vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation none bureaucrat responds to tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just nbecause you picked today to clean up nthe world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them na significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from dreper and from the police and those subplots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments nin one scene stretch scares off dreper by getting chummy with police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenlysuspected heroes in public place watching television news report of the crime which shows their pictures nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events perhaps making particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through selfdestructive behavior noh the irony of it ntupac shakur made career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up nin gridlockd shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him nspoon is an idea for character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction nmostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite and roth plays stretch with gleeful selfdestructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy ngridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him nwith friends like that spoon does nt need enemies and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of man who has seen too much nthe tragedy now is that we wo nt get more chances to see those eyes again
bdirector luis mandokis last film was the superb serious drama when man loves woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in bottle which is the worst type of romance movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso there an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes tedious bore to sit through message in bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper nsoon heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message nof course garrett turns out to be handsome rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner nshe is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died few years earlier ndo you think you know where this is headed nmost likely you do and would nt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that did nt buy for second nif there are any positive things to say about message in bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garretts stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city nmeanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently nit seems that with such bad luck he would nt want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on stormswept sea nthe other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune nthe first half of message in bottle plays like humdrum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining nusually am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking nwhen the main characters of film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble ni swear that while watching message in bottle felt as if had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks nalways one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after nthis same exact problem occurred in last years very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar mean meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama city of angels nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding message in bottle of their own preferably before filming began nit should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain
baccording to popular film opinion films greatness is determined by time ntake for example casablanca ngreat film even today nits still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic nanother example would be star wars which had very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about billion times before nbut as rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of kinda felt like it was nt as cool as when had first seen it ni had liked it when saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as good escape film nbut when rewatched it felt cheated nthus the curse of the event film independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for couple kids the critics in this situation nbut after while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one nwell this kid is the event film in my little analogy nand when rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but felt insulted the whole time nthere are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just are nt sure if its comedy or hokey drama none scene you ll see hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next you ll see bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines nthe worst is scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda nnow this annoying kids problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls nand independence day has no balls nit plays it safe everywhere nit throws in ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films nthe chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars ni mean is nt that devils den nand the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in striptease ntheyre these octopus men boring freaking octopus men ni mean come on nthe aliens in were more interesting and you did nt even see them nbasically the plot is straight from bmovie from the aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful nokay its an interesting topic but its not handled greatly nnow they are nt and somehow computer geek jeff goldblum figure out they re using our satellites as countdown to destruction nyep nthese aliens are not only heavily armed they re stupid too nthey also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later nthe president bill pullman who under attack for being wimp decides this would be nice time to be belligerent and he decides hell stay in the white house which the aliens have covered ni do nt care if its bob freaking dole in the white house get him out of there ni do nt care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol just get him out of there nlater on he stupid and wants to fly in the attack on big alien ship ni think its time for impeachment for this guy nhes more senile than reagan on pot nthen there cocky pilot will smith who is the only person to survive the counterattack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area the films only sign of being brave nhis girlfriends stripper sharing subplot with striptease in that she has to do it for her son ncome on she has fighter pilot boyfriendsoontobe fiance ni think she can quit that job and get more respectable job at long john silvers nshes also the few the proud the lucky to survive the igniting of as well as her dog who narrowly survives nthere are some bright spots nthey tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing nthe best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave nand they even played its the end of the world as we know it and feel fine at the beginning nand judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great he stereotype but just loved the man anyway nbut there are no real subtle comic moments nwill gets way too many oneliners and he has no one to play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great nas said this film has no balls nit is just aiming for crowd pleaser and that what it is nbut after couple months we all move on to the next event film while intaking little films and couple indy ones for good measure nbut at least the indy ones last for lifetime nthis ones short on batteries
bjohn sayles men with guns is about what happens to society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness nhowever like so many central american countries this one also features modernity nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it nthe films main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category none of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive nfuentes is true liberal caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians nwith government assistance he has trained large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate nthis program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was good idea nhowever when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned nas he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other nwhen dr fuentes asks village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we did nt nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power ndr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss nfirst there is young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither mother nor father nnext fuentes crosses paths with thief named domingo dami delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities nthrough his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his selfrespect and defines himself only by his pistol nalong the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami alc zar priest who has lost his faith nas domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching nlast the group takes on mute girl named graciela tania cruz who has nt spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her nsayles two major strengths as director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but longerthannecessary running time is sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor nhe creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the films overarching theme of violence as power domingos attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is is nt nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself nsayles knows how to bring location to life whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in matewan or contemporary texasmexico bordertown in lone star nsayles is not particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain nsayles also maintains strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects nthe one exception is couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on few hundred miles south of the texas border nit would not be stretch to say that men with guns is depressing film nin fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure nin addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillos inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being nnevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly nthe last shot of the film does offer hint of hope even in world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns

brobin hood men in tights is another melbrooksproduced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit nunfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world nit is in short one of the worst movies have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce nthe plot borrows heavily from the wellreceived kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves nthis is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie nmel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on nthe movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice ncary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard nhe escapes and joining with man named achoo am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham na good adventure plot that is sadly unused nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating nneither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply are nt funny nor believable nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter man playing macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that really felt like leaving the theatre nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre nchuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rentawreck then from any dialogue whatsoever nscenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive nthe basic plot that robin has received key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny nmel brooks as circumcisiongiving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails nthe addition of blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard nhe is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting nif you ca nt do nt even bother watching this miserable film

beven though have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality nlike everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies nconsequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorfs tribe nlet me start out by saying that krippendorfs tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but that about its only asset nthe best word to describe this film is asinine nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty nkrippendorfs tribe tries to be zany offthewall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about character or two nfinally and most importantly more than of the jokes have to work nonce upon time james krippendorf dreyfuss was respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college nhe and his wife obtained grant to seek out lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea goal which they never accomplished nshortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorfs wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own nnow over year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give lecture on his findings nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates tale about mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu nto provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb nsoon much to krippendorfs surprise the shelmikedmu are national phenomenon nbut one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is fraud nthe only way krippendorfs tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt nunfortunately its impossible to like or sympathize with bunch of putzes like this ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than device to implement various dubious gags nmeanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative nthe acting in underwhelming ndreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf nalongside him jenna elfman the spunky costar of tvs dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else nthis quality while fine for minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of featurelength movie nno one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allens daughter in everyone says love you excels ni know that movies in trouble when its half the length of titanic but seems much longer nmost of what comes on screen is generic sitcom level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set nif there any upside its that do nt see much boxoffice support developing for this lame illmarketed miscue nkrippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct
bquiz show an almost perfectly accurate true story is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mids twentyone non this trivial game show contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to category of their choice on which they wagered an amount of points on nthe game went on until player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win nbut after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to contestant before the game began nquiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants herbie stempel and charles van doren nstempel john turturro former nand your jewish man raising family nstempel has been the reigning champion on twentyone for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars nin his mind he is the best thing on television and the people love him nalthough in the mind of the shows producers herbie stempel is getting old ndan enright david paymer in particular feels that the people are tired of seeing jewish guy from queens with bad teeth and that the kids need someone better to look up to ntherefore they need to find another contestant whom would be worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win nsomeone who can defeat stempel even if they have to resort to cheating nenter charles van doren ralph fiennes welleducated professor from widely recognized family nvan doren had decided to try out for the game show tic tac dough because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing nbut when albert freedman hank azaria enrights assistant spots van doren the two decide that they have found their soontoberuler of the twentyone kingdom nvan doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer on purpose in order to lose the game nafter stempel loses the throne to van doren he starts to feel cheated which he should nmeanwhile on his own dick goodwin rob morrow harvard law graduate has decided to start an investigation on twentyone to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings nhis investigation yields shocking results and leads to trial for enright and the others involved nquiz show is an extremely well done movie and robert redfords direction is especially superb nthe performances turned in by john turturro ralph fiennes and rob morrow are very good although it seems that turturro stands out more than any nquiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film ndefinitely film you should not miss
bpossibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk nit smashed box office office records in its opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here nbut is it any good nin word no nill elaborate further nthe story is as follows napparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on none where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other tourist attraction which failed before it even opened see jurrasic park nimgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to new attraction in san diago nrealizing what bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island nenter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there nso basically what you have is this ntwo teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them na fairly good idea however its let down by one slight problem nits crap nover two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky nadd to this terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested nit becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like what for tea and should you cut the lawn later yes you should nits shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park nwith only few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous ndinosaurs the rexs have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world na very dissapointing sequel indeed
bplay it to the bone is punchdrunk mess of movie ncontaining good cast but awful acting an interesting premise but terrible execution ron shelton white men ca nt jump gives us rocky story with not one rocky but two nrocky no is vince boudreau woody harrelson edtv bald tattooed newly converted christian whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as curse word nsomething that he has not yet successfully achieved nrocky no is caesar dominguez antonio banderas the th warrior best friend of vince who is currently dating vinces exgirlfriend grace nboth men are nearing the end of their almost careers when fluke provides them with redemptive opportunity nwhen both fighters of the undercard of vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated the fight promoters need to find quick replacement nour boys are tapped to fight each other the winner of which is promised shot at future title fight nthe film is divided into two sections nat first we have buddy road picture as our two heroes in graces sassy grassy green muscle car travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day nalong the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by nonce in vegas the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar nboth mr harrelson and mr banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past not that we know it from their work here nmr harrelson is uncomfortably awkward apparently never having gotten firm handle on vince nthe christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable nmr banderas is uncharacteristically noncharismatic as caesar nweak and ineffectual there is little life in his screen performance nthe other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another ntom sizemore saving private ryan robert wagner austin powers ii the spy who shagged me and richard masur fire down below are crooked promoters lucy liu payback is sexstarved hitchhiker looking for good time and lolita davidovich gods and monsters is the shared girlfriend who ca nt make her mind up which boxer she prefers nbecause of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them the film flounders with all the appeal of dead fish until the boxing match actually begins nbut even then because the outcome is so predictably obvious the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other nwriterdirector ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed wellchoreographed welledited and wellperformed nif only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film nas it is the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable nthe title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film nthe phrase play it to the bone is reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal nthat is biblical principle know ye not that they which run in race run all but one receiveth the prize nso run that ye may obtain corinthians kjv nachieving anything worthy in life requires playing it to the bone nwe need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives nthis is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives nas movie play it to the bone is hardly worth our time nbut as principle of life the phrase play it to the bone are words to live by
byou may not have heard of lucas or if you have you might not think much of it nprobably because it stars corey haim or maybe because its about little geek who collects insects or maybe because it does nt feature slick oneliners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost requirement for teen films in the nhowever you have been missing out on true masterpeice the best film of and the best film about adolescent life ever made ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh tiny year old with scruffy hair thick glasses and an interest in insects and other outdoor life none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him nher name is maggie year old who certainly is beauty with lovely red hair and sweet innocent complexion nmaggie seems to be little disturbed by this little kid watching her but somehow he interests her and soon they are talking and getting to know one another nthey gradually become good friends and spend the summer together doing various things such as studying insects namely locusts who come out of hiding once every years playing tennis and listening to symphony orchestra through manhole cover nlucas is obviously in love with maggie and while she is charmed by him its clear that she would never consider him anything more than very good friend nthis is not clear to lucas however nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what about to happen nwe soon find out why in painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during pep rally nthey throw him on stage right in front of his beloved maggie nsurprisingly he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around but he takes it too far and is embarassed in front of the entire school nthe next scene is brilliant nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened nhe rails back against her in cruel unfair fashion nin lesser movies this would ve turned into confrontation between the two characters nbut maggie is written smarter than that nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie charlie sheen nhe is jock with typical cheerleader girlfriend nwhats interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks nof course anyone with brain can tell what gon na happen next ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone nshes been assigned to show him how to operate the washerdryer so he can clean his shirt nmaggie is charmed by cappies tender undertsanding demeanor not to mention his shirtless body nthis scene is so delicate and sweet but cappie still has girlfriend preventing either one from acting on their desires ndesperately trying to puncture the tension cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room nits not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend in the films only subpar scene nlucas finally figures out what going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself such as try out for the football team nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt nwhile the idea seems cliched the way it is executed is not nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up ndave grusins memorable score played at the perfect moments certainly helps nlucas is filled with great performances nforget everything you know about corey haim nback in he had talent and that is proven here as he delivers perfect fully dimensional performance filled with anger humor and pain nkerri green is very appealing as maggie showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her nsheens cappie is almost too good to be true but sheen makes him beleivable especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popittis ben friend of lucas whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks nalso turning up in few key scenes is winona ryder as rina the girl who admires lucas from afar nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the you hear john hughes this and john hughes that nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his socalled classics nbut hopefully like with heathers and say anything lucas can begin to find its own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald nit deserves more than that but do nt want to be greedy
bsome movies should just skip nmy daughter and had really vile time at my favorite martian few weeks back and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program ntrue the probgram is only years old this time and its cartoon nbut its cartoon liked and was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen nbut my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be nturns out was right mostly ninspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jivetalking sidekick nat first thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula is nt just business its way of life nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits nin some parts you can just hear them saying more zany ni want more zany here and here lets have really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful ni want the audience squirming in their seats ok that fine but want you to add bug guts what does this scene do ncharacter depth nbut where the zaniness ni do nt see zany here nif you ca nt make it zany cut it nthe latter is the only explanation can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie nmichelle who plays penny gadgets niece shines in every scene she in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor ndabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in few unexceptional scenes nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor noteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregons own manic mayor vera katz that had to wonder if the studio was nt poking fun at our fair town nor maybe all career politicians are like that ni must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla nhe appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film nd hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick in role that firmly sets emancipation back years nthe dialog is lets face it its pretty bad nthe tagline after major setpiece battle is faux pas that makes no sense in context na lot of the lines especially hughleys appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for adlib nabout threequarters of the film is somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget npenny does about minute and half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon nlet me rage here just for minute nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character nshes utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pintsize detective nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is real mystery nthe film loses star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity ninspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but its very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits nthe evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen nall in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers nbut if true why nif they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find team that can produce one and then give them chance to do it
bthere seem to be two reactions to dark city nyou either love it or you are unimpressed ncount me as love it nas good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better nwhere the former two have specific comicbook following the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal nit has similar look to the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent nnot clever or complex the story is still fascinating like selection from the twilight zone na man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub by man with syringe nsurprised the attacker runs off nthe dazed man gets out of the tub and finds womans body in the room na mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why he leaving or what he fleeing nghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in nightmare nan odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his nthe amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch nnow if only he could remember the rest of his life ndark city is good on many levels nfirst the look of the movie is excellent ngive credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating coherent look from diverse elements nthere are visual elements from the american ss mixed with dickensera urban industrial elements nit is all pulled together in sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hoppers painting nighthawks nproyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the films world for not only does the audience see the city model but so do the ghouls nthe look is like cross between tim burtons batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay nsecond the editing of the film is good nthe pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments nalso the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie tense caffeinated look nthird the special effects are well used nthey look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job none example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically na simple ripple effect is used na more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous nrestraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive nfinally like gattaca dark city spends just little effort striving for mythical significance nunlike gattaca the story is just openended and nonliteral enough to be successful njohn murdochs recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn nhis struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world nwhen we finally see the big picture of the movies world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of giant turtle na few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness
bive got to admit it nim huge jim carrey fan ni loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumberand even in batman forever which was pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good nuntil saw ace ventura had no idea how people could find the guy annoying nsadly ace ventura shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be ncarrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funnyit is just rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace nthe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save raccoon in reasonable cliffhanger spoof nsoon he is called out of retirement to find bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other nonce again its up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills nthose who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him overacting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel does nt capture the feel of the original nthe original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences which were hysterically funny nhere however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise ninstead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly nbut one of the biggest problems had was with the character of ventura himself nin the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one elseperfect for carreys offthewall approach nbut here ventura is made to look lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guya role which is definitely not carreys style nthere are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between nthey are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber
ba followup to disneys liveaction dalmatians that better more entertaining than the first njust as unlikely nwith dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier ns dalmatians certainly was nt the greatest moviegoing experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous largerthanlife performance nin addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the yearold actress under that startling black and white wig of hers nbut that only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film nwhat makes dalmatians such collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost singlehandedly foisted on wisecracking macaw who thinks he dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blanderthanbland alice evans as parole officer named chlo ngruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans ca nt even aspire to that nthe dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even closes split ends are more animated nbad acting however seems to be requirement for this sequel since rard depardieu shows up as french furrier with haircut like robert de niros in men of honor njean pierre le pelt is flamboyant fashion designer with penchant for fine furs and depardieus overthetop antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail nfrances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into caricature of himself and in dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all its worthle pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum nthe finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben nthat done its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore offlimits sables and minks and plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of hooded designer gown nthe dogs are pretty cutetry making puppy look otherwisebut that pretty much all they are ntheres always the feeling that there trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop tape into the videocasette recorder nsavvy holiday goers should skip dalmatians and pop the original animated classic into their vcrs instead nits one dalmatian less but more satisfying
bhouse on haunted hill starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan ndirected by william malone written by dick beebe house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible none doctor is killed instantly after having pencil rammed completely through his neck na nurse has her head forced into barrel of water nthese mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous bhorror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements nexcept this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be nin past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims house on haunted hill does nt want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think nthis nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film house on haunted hill which is based on the film of the same title introduces handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest nthe film has no intention of providing character development or laudable plot nthe aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem nhowever the film is neither scary nor unpredictable nthe plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush neach character is failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money nsince the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them nthe problem is that every character is not likable nthe two who come closest to being civilized are womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films lot better than this with all of his talent and businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter nthe characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them nthe worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattans watson pritchett nhe spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself nwaiting for pritchett to die was strenuously difficult act to sit through nthe most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original nplaying the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face nhowever rush is pretty much wasted in confusing subplot involving hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen nthe main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary nto top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous nif the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep blue sea the goal for creating creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed
bmy fellow americans is movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or movie that we ve all seen million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins nthis is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way nthe movie starts with quick and do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner nwilliam haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president nthere is scandal that arises involving kickback from contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago nhe finds scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead nthis movie was exceptional for many reasons none being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together nthey worked very well as unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being ladies man and one being the old man ill let you fiqure which is which nalso they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well nit seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was congressman nexperience counts for lot
bdo film critics have morals nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow nnaturally we do nt want to go into film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish nsecondly and along the same line we ca nt prejudge film because of its stars director etc the difference nwell in the first one we go into film thinking its going to be dumb or its going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so not expecting much non the second hand were simply assuming it will be bad or good because of personal grudge against the film company its made by disney noh its just merchandising ploy then the actors jim carreys in it nits gon na stink or the director who ncant be that good nthis is more of biased viewpoint as opposed to first impression viewpoint nmake sense nok but what about comparing nisnt that kind of along the same lines nwhen we compare certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair nsure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons lot more but what about jackie brown for example nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ni think it is and ill tell you why na good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film nsometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but was bored or loved it nit was sooooo cheezy nmight be used to describe film nthese are contradictions and critic has to weigh both sides and come to suitable balanced critique nbut which is more important nand which is better nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ngetting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway nevery average person out there who interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction nand so as critic already responsible to ask that same question njackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the who is likely to make big comeback thanks to her role as the title character ntarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison jackie is yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fictions samuel jackson and comparison nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish scheme worth half million dollars ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and not as friendly intended as we hope he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars nthe thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he willing to kill anyone who stands in the way njackie finds herself in tight squeeze nordell wo nt think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she always done yet at the same time compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided nit comes down to simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison nwhat ensues is rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself ncoming into play is another veteran robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry nmaxs obvious fondness for jackie will become major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance nalso involved is ordells surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with bong in hand nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but there nothing more to her and therefore she becomes tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters nde niro is also wasted in his role as quiet nobody crook out to score few bucks for himself nde niro is brilliant actor but character who hardly ever speaks does nt need de niro to play him ncompared to pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable nin pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it would nt have suffered much with lesser talented cast the exception being grier ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is reversed truth nsadly grier too could have received bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life njackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction is nt as awesome as the first time njules was the rambling biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off nand although jackson is really really good in jackie brown do nt think he quite as irreplaceable nin fact maybe new face would have been better njackson could ve remained tarantinos jules and new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories nsadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just is nt as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning nthis is griers film so why spend so long getting to know man who will become more of supporting character as the film progresses nit not only makes the movie feel little too slanted but it makes for slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel rum punch nfor those moviegoers do nt expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of film making nthe directing has toned down bit however yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints nso getting back to the question that began with this is nt pulp fiction at all nits good but it is nt anything that made pulp fiction such revolutionary effort in the first place nthis is more conservative tarantino but not one that wo nt satiate true fans nif you can realize that this is nt going to knock your socks off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet nafter all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy
when will the devil take me he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over nthe spoiled title character of onegin pronounced ohneggin is waiting on death to relieve him after lifetime of rapacious behaviour nmartha fiennes debut feature is quite literally filmed poetry its based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin profound study of regret of how we confuse shame with guilt nwhen we first meet eugene onegin ralph acting for his sister another brother magnus composed the score philandering aristocrat from st petersburg he has just inherited his uncles estate nwith plans to sell it onegin pays summer visit to the manor which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside and not long into the trip he meets neighbouring family of blue bloods nsmitten with olga larina headey he befriends olgas fianc vladimir lensky stephens while olgas sister tatyana tyler romanticizing his flippant attitude he nineteenth bad boy falls for onegin nin one sweaty inky torrent of passion tatyana writes him love letter nhe is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections it is implied because he can nsoon after tragedy strikes and onegin makes himself scarce nwhen we catch up with him six years later he has just returned to st petersburg where at grand ball he discovers that an old friend donovan has married more womanly and wordly tatyana nthis time onegin finds her irresistable nwhat is most amazing about ralph fiennes performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch noverwhelmed by top hat the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past nthe actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long nowtheres room to breathe in role that made up of shades of gray like onegin npetula clark sang of universal phenomenon in parking lot you do nt know what you ve got til its gone nonegins aboutface on tatyana speaks for those of us read most of us who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well nwhat the character feels is not jealousy but remorse embarrassment even at having let her go nout of identification we feel empathy for onegin callous bastard ntatyanas emotions echo thousand ditties but that makes them no less vital nshe changes too from girl in crush to woman with divided loyalties ntyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk costars filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in series of wanton stares nthey both have faces mr fiennes and ms tyler capable of conveying archetypal russian misery nonegin could have added up to little more than distinguished episode of masterpiece theater even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact were martha fiennes not at the helm nan mtv background she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others has positively influenced her sense of pace though thankfully not her shot lengthsno spasmodic cutting here at just over minutes onegin clicks along like brisk walk through valleys of despair nthe film has an atypical period look as well nabsent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions nthe sets are almost expressionistically bare echoing the loneliness of the protagonists cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them reminded the climax which unfolds in sea of white nmartha fiennes has clear command of cinema and her spare often painfully human visual presentation of yevgeny onegin is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkins difficult text yet nms fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind camera since jane campion
bit was with great anticipation that sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner nwhat was in for was disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay nit abounds with high production values john tolls awardwinning cinematography which also graced edward zwicks legends of the fall gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names nbut this does not save misguided script nthe film wishes to paint its central character as hero but the viewers only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producerdirector mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him nbut wallaces actions paint different story nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king nwallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance nafter kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england nthis is evident of spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay nit is shame that such an excellent score is part of such terrible film nhorners score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help ngibson portrays wallace in such way that the audience can not relate to him or identify with him nthis drags down any emotional connection to the films plot and turns three hours into total waste of time
the beach is structurally confusing film that can only describe has having multiple personality disorder nevery forty minutes of this twohour film begins with new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act nit starts off purposefully as film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in dangerous environment nbut then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes story about love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of blue lagoon nforty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining sense of bliss at all costs nby the time its over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about nthe main character of the beach is angstridden richard leonardo dicaprio nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you re looking for good time nrichards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into world of the unknown nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for nhe checks into fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle nhe seems like raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen nmoreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make small city high for life ncaptivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards nonce they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard netienne is about as exciting as fluffy white sand nits odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has way of hiding potential threats just out of view nand once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers nfor example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark nthere are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own featurelength film ntheres the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopiagoneawry angle nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred ndicaprio as result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through nconsequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up
bthe great actor james woods once said and paraphrasing if sex is nt messy then you re not doing it right na truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film nfor those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or subgenre is melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of plot that follows an identical outline usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens la halloween nurban legend is mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special nfor film makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in stale frightfree horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you ca nt scare your audience gross em out if you ca nt do that make em laugh nalas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not by intention ni actually find the fact that this film became minor success million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it nit seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with three digit iq argue that it provides them nunfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films do nt need to do anything more than promise good time without the added pressure of delivering nif anyone disagrees would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla nbut forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation offshoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiastic exploitation nthese flicks are nt harnessed with any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience bloody good time nsadly out of the literally hundreds made would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on college campus which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer nyou see the campus is community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface nall those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected nall the better for that elusive crazed killer ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of little exploitation into the proceedings should be relatively easy task nbut alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full its way too clean slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity little gore and much stupidity nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than dunno exercise nits the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses runninglikethewindprey yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques nits the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loudnoisejumpscare thing nyes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but would nt anyone if loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when caught glimpse of the killer napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers nin scream it was ghost mask scary enough in know what you did last summer it was fisher mans rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka with fury hood ooh scary intended to conceal hisher identity nfor urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume nthough must admit urban legend does have winning premise for what could have been somewhat entertaining exploitation film nthe films killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they re coming from inside the house ni wo nt spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough nsad to say it does nt include my favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and very unhappy gerbil nnow that would be scary nbefore leave you would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ve ever spent an evening with nonly jared leto looking like carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness nthe most annoying of the bunch is tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as supremely irritating lout so irritating actually cheered his painful death and am not cruel person nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film if viewed as vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining nafter all this is movie that features the kind of faux hipsters ca nt stand getting slaughtered which is at least better than watching an entire film about people ca nt stand not getting slaughtered
bit was with huge lack of something to do that decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon when the only good things on tv are the secondrate movies they show some are good they showed total recall before this one nif you know me think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live nand this includes keanu reeves nwhat do hate about seagal ni hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and nonthreatening situation the squint ni hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around bullying people up saying stupid lines with brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynolds hairpiece in boogie nights ni despise how he never gets bruise in any of his fights ni hate how every single plot twist leads to just melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain ni hate his nonsatirical messages in the beginning of this one he slaps on quote from arthur miller which has nothing to do with the film except its about brooklyn where this film takes place nand hate how he so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing during the end credits he has good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him nsure the guys probably nice guy in person actually found him very nonthreatening when he was on letterman not too long ago nbut the guy makes worse films than reagan did nso what the plot of this shitterpiece nwell something nabout him trying to catch stupidass crook william forsythe who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight ni could nt believe how bad this scene was the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ahem nand forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off nim sorry did anyone ever hear of concealing ones self nso in comes exbrooklynite seagal who dedicates his life to catching this guy nand just wished he had caught him in the beginning then ended the film nbut noooo this drags on as he bullies forsythes family members including stupid barowner and none other than gina gershon as his other barowner sister nand forsythe more than once threatens his family nat one point he actually comes to their house and stalks them like nonthreatening nicholson in the shining complete with them all hiding in the bathroom but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away nseagal paints himself as lovable person with son and fiancee nhe even shows him hanging with his son checking up on his homework and then about to take him out for bit of catch when he conveniently called away on assignment ni dunno about you but playing catch with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares nhe also shows him as that badass he wants to be with scenes of him bullying crooks around and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he unarmed chinese guy swinging bats with pool cue nserves them right nthis film as some of his do has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented but do nt appear to be in this film ni already mentioned gina gershon who pretty horrible in this one as well as william forsythe who overacts terribly ni know this guy can act he was awesome in raising arizona as goodmans partner in crime nbut he just awful here njerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down nwhy is he the only one who gives good performance nwell because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility nhe seems to be in here just to give it cool law and order feeling even if its not cool feeling nand in cameos are brated eroticthrillercinemaxstyle stars shannon whirry as terry malloy which is more of bad joke than clever one and athena massey noh nand er julliana margiulles has two scenes out for justice just proves once again that american action films just suck ni know that there such good thing as good action he called john woo nbut if you re in the mood for some good old nobrainer funyetdumb action do nt bother watching this nits so stupid that its boring
gordy is not movie it is minutelong sesame street skit and very bad one at that nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that its depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is disney movie nim sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it nit is the story of farm piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible nactually its almost funny in way nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of truck and essentially steals him njinnie is country singer and the film goes off on huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it nwhat is the point of this nmaybe she is one of the producers relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something nwe then cut to huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with suit on nah did nt see that one coming nstarts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of food processing corporation when hanks grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank nand gordy nof course there must be villain but even this villain donadio as sipes is nt that evil nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story nits hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is family film or if the filmmakers are just this untalented and stupid nat times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded nbut its just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me see also babe
bplot rich guy who does nt believe in love orders mailorder bride for himself nthat very evening the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter nbut what this none of them might not be the person they are pretending to be nwow nsin indeed ncritique easily one of the worst movies that ve seen all year ntoo long too boring too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching good movie nwhat the hell were they thinking when they made this thing its no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about year this felt like really bad tv movie of the week with some nudity stuffed in from time to time just to wake up the audience nhave you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one that you just could nt help but switch back to from time to time just to make sure that it was nt part of some sick joke nwell this movie is exactly like that only it is nt joke it is nt on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ni say again what the shite were they thinking nokay so where do start nfirst of all the trailer of this film gives away the movies main plot twist the betrayal nso for the first half hour of the film you re basically just sitting there watching these two lovers go through the motions until the betrayal occurs nwhoopee big surprise nsecond of all angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part nwhy nwell its like this not for one second do you ever believe that she is not nasty backstabbing woman ni mean its like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining well the same goes here nevery look in jolies eyes screams psycho nthen of course you have the case of the patsy husband man who just ca nt seem to figure out anything in time ni mean how nboring is that for the audience nyoure watching this guy screw up time after time after time and somehow were supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude nno thanks nand if we do nt care about him and we really do nt care about her she beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film nwell ill tell you nthe only thing that was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled nno suspense no chemistry between the leads no real love or passion no sense of surprise plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending nso why am even giving this film rating of three points nwell its actually pretty simple ni liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolies boobies that two points right there and another one for antonios ass hairless just for the record neverything else in this movie was pointless boring and just plain stupid ntry imagining softporn movie but nwithout the plot nthats pretty much what you ve got here na low point in the careers of both stars noops almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue god noh mighty make nit stop nwheres joblo coming from namerican psycho cruel intentions eyes wide shut fatal attraction playing by heart under suspicion what lies beneath what women want whipped
bwhen people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the nfor new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids nfor people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era nmartin scorseses taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all nthe movies protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he ca nt sleep at nights nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantines presidential campaign ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre nlosing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street nhe purchases formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi nas many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in th century same as in our times nfor others the movie uses raskolnikovlike figure in order to portray burning problems of america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of lifetime can give arguments for both sides nhis travis bickle has lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain nhowever most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen nbut despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but does nt have stomachlack of brains to do it nwhile de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively feel nwizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with americas better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pres generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade nother characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age nmatthew sport keitel who befriended reallife pimps in other to prepare for his role of lifetime is dressed like hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in ideology of counterculture nporno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy neven the politicians like senator palantine are lost in postvietnam and postwatergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program ca nt fool even such idiots like travis nthe past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism ca nt be washed away even by ironic happy end ntravis and his world found themselves in desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schraders screenplay into the silver screen nnew york city in the night is portrayed as hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie nnow more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory
bin arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved very mixed reaction to sure blockbuster ndespite the fact the script and plot is bit of let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department nin terms of characters by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala natalie portman whose mature performance far exceeds her tender years of age nshe is one hot babe who defines true woman leadership nshe not only has presence but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up plan to do anything nthe young obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who has bad hair day in every scene gets to kill bad guy in the end but lacks love interest to make him desirable sort of hero nin fact all the jedi knight are bit asexual there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners ni mean it would be interesting to see yodas girlfriend for change if he has one nnot much better is quigon jinn liam neeson who mostly broods and has better hair do than obiwan but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life nalso fascinating is george lucas metoclorian theory which claims that microorganisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader no doubt concept stolen from the christian faith except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that its predecessor almost command viewing of this inferior successor nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan nwatch out for the next one it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker who believe should be portrayed by leonardo di caprio
bwritten by john grisham and robert altman as al hayes ndirected by robert altman nsome time ago young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of popular novel nthe novel was summer smash topping bestseller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads nthe only problem the novel was nt very good nit was far more pulp than pulitzer nbut the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not great writer was fantastic storyteller nso he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen nthe director nfrancis ford coppola nthe book of course was mario puzos the godfather nthe rest as they say in showbiz was history nby bringing up the godfather do nt mean to suggest that robert altmans the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ndepends on whom you ask nbut there no question that grishams work grabs people nlike puzo grisham is better storyteller than writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is good idea man but who ca nt tell wellconstructed story from can of spam nso something in grishams unpublished story of cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at years old remains one of americas greatest living filmmakers nthe result is gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon nfrom its opening shot to the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated with sense of dread with fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe nthis terrific sense of mood is classic altman touch nwitness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on red sports car speeding over bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for few surprises npay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived by john grisham but by altman nthis is what great director can do for questionable source material nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases nmagruder has just won high profile case and celebrates that night with catered party at his office noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen ndriven by southern chivalry driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress magruder offers her ride home nthere he learns more about mallorys life than he bargained for nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall ted kyzynskistyle whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter nmagruder perhaps influenced by mallorys decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic to her plight and offers to help her get her father committed right after he sleeps with her of course nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down dangerous path with black end nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in mental hospital and for moment all appears well nbut then dixons crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger nthe cops wo nt lift finger to help liberal attorney nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling privateeye sidekick clyde robert downey jr nif this predicament was nt bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos naltman may provide the atmosphere but branaghs performance holds the gingerbread man together nan accomplished actor when he is nt directing himself in vanity productions branagh does fine job of making rick sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness or of egotism nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it and by then its too late nas the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are nand life is never so bad that it ca nt get worse nif you re familiar with altmans work you ll recognize several of his signature techniques ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style nand of course there my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot nthanks to altman here are some of the actresses ve had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand nand now can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film nis it oldschool sexism or clever injoke nyou be the judge nbut back to the picture at hand nin the hands of mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured nin the hands of master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorseses cape fear remake which tried for the same result nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altmans greatest work is weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grishams story so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are nthey probably wanted it to look more like time to kill nand that my friends should make you very afraid
bcountries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally nluckily movie reviewers are nt burdened with such legislation notherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer nin case of star wars science fiction epic by george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans nin any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times nthose who do nt usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film nlike so many previous reviewers must note that watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that remained enchanted by the experience ever since nperhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in galaxy far away nor perhaps it was the rush felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation had read before nanyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life nand it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such strong impact on me like george lucas epic nstar wars was nt just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema nuntil than american motion picture industry was in limbo social turmoil in practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywoods financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies nas result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate did nt want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood nserious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre nuntil science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain nin late bigger budgets for science fiction did nt look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of space odyssey nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies nhowever in star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually does nt like it nas result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early nafter that science fiction continued to be considered synonym for family entertainment nironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx and nostalgic drama american graffiti nboth movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular nin sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it nbut unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience nthe plot set long time ago in galaxy far away begins in time of civil war nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic nin order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets nthe information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots cpo anthony daniels and rd kenny baker nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot nhis adventure begins when rd escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force nafter some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew ncritics who do nt like the movie especially those who ca nt forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality non the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the and yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawas samurai classic the hidden fortress non the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references nthe others would find the authors element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes neven out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as strictly technical piece of the seven art ngeorge lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup ncharacters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster nwe have comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters nsome of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form nunfortunately the same ca nt be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character threedimensional enough to launch his further acting career nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology noften comparisons with space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick nhowever the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although special edition did improve them significantly yet they are nt the most remembered trademark of the movie nthat honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release nyet even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture
bas walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon thought to myself that had had just seen great film nwith the passage of few hours tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether masterpiece must implicitly be great piece of work and viceversa nattempting to make distinction may be matter of splitting hairs ni avoided commitment by appealing to etymology nas the word implies masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of master nas such it should suffice to say that it is product of exceptional quality ncrouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category ncrouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology nit is reminiscent of wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be halfgods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and golden pupil which must choose between the two nit is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment pair of masters and pair of youngsters are poignantly represented nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic toursdeforce not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of lake nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry nas in wagnerian opera there is substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as work of art rooted in fantasy ndo not assume however that the art is limpwristed nfor those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance nthere are no weak performances in this movie nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart nzhang ziyi is budding superstar nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in multifaceted role ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably nkudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen woping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film nang lee as the director coproducer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies ndont miss it
beverything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here nwincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence nbilly zane is wooden as the hero nkristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it ntreat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains have ever seen in movie nonly catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in good performance nshe has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of noh yeah the phantom also has secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wo nt even care nabout the only things can recommend are good performance by jones and some colorful scenery nhowever if you re looking for fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper nthis is not good movie
bi know what would do with million if found it in previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if were with jacob and lou huh nwell in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in nhe and his dimwitted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon large bag of cash inside plane wreck nagainst his better judgement hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities nthe rest of the film is question of who is going to die to keep this secret and is it worth it na simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle noh and its much better than any of those nsam raimi took departure from his normal freakshow horrormonkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture nhe really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do ni think raimi knew he had winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on natural flowing course none of the films components can be linked to recurring theme in terrence malicks the thin red line nin malicks three hour boreathon he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story nit seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to field of flowing grass small bird or flowing body of water nsure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty to his efforts nraimi does fine job of tying in fox in chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters ni think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is very intriguing ingredient in the film nand then there billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood nif it can continute to produce people like thorton hollywood will be ok nhe gives fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here nit is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so njacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought ni wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or did nt know how to say or if he was just taking long time to think about the thing he just said nhere he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry nthough the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has very appealing new twist in its characters npaxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group far cry from chet in wierd science nperhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advicegiving wife but she certainly does nt do anything ruin the picture na simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty unredeeming nbut at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts
bthe happy bastards quick movie review nthe concept of enjoying stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control nsadly that is the case with kingpin film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there something about mary and dumb and dumber nsince the duo directed and did nt write the script can assume that part of the problem nthe story seems good enough pro bowler in the by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world nhis popularity has gone through the roof and he getting his career off the ground nthen however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything nthese two form an illtimed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming eds abandoned him and he about to lose his hand in bowling ball machine nforward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand tornup car and of course the occasional knocking up of the uglyass landlord to avoid paying rent for while nhowever he finds glimmer of hope upon visit to local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm nwith the kids help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada nof course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well he amish nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roys process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow nfinally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel nthe main problem had with kingpin was nt the fact it was nt funny nin fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roys explanation of not having children something involving cheese grater nbut that just it scenes ntheres couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend ni mean was this really necessary ncouldnt have this been handled just bit wackier ni mean this is comedy why throw ethics in nparticularly in farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken nthat really ruined it however and that too bad nthe acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting nstill if you re going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or still be little bit irked
bas african american detective vergil tibbs questions suspected white murderer inside jail cell there is wonderful eyecatching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film nthe shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars nto see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film nas black detective conducting an investigation in southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as threat simply because of the color of his skin nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous nthis one shot amazes me because it captures whole theme in matter of seconds nit perhaps may be the most powerful image have seen in film in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america njewison has very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present npreceding the very original soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters nthe film which won best picture in focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in white town where is he not wanted ntibbs is man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him nas hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist npoitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character nnever nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing nhowever unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance nas sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows great amount of skill in his role nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople nhe would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him nas the film progresses though there is very gradual change in the sheriff nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors nwhat really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil ninstead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future nmost movies would have character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in matter of minutes nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day njewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or major city and small town in the united states during the nit displays this perfectly nhowever the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving credible explanation involving the murder victim nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being suspect was not needed nalso it is given that tibbs is vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson nhe managed to be in the two best movies of in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood
bits amazing how comedian can have the some of the funniest standup around but completely fall flat in the movies ntake adam sandler non the basis of his first two cds they re all gon na laugh at you nand what the hell happened to me nhes the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams nbut when you put him in front of camera it just is nt the same ni kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted marginal recommendation but his latest film the waterboy is about as funny as root canal nseriously willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here nin fact found this movie to be more depressing than comedic nthe first half hour generated not one smile in me with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players but also by his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming to ngranted after the film gets rolling there are few mild chuckles throughout even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for its nearly hour and half running time nyoure all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves nand believe me not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins nif you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be with you nthe only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobbys love interest ni mean they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose but they do extremely well with what they are given here nkudos to both of them nmy advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen nrely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh nor maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did with the recent truman show nwith the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just ca nt keep going on like this

bi went to blair witch project book of shadows with the highest of hopes nthe original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor nunfortunately my hopes were soon dashed nas the movie opens the audience is shown pseudodocumentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as result of the original blair witch project movie nits mostly humorous selfaware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film nduring this segment we are introduced to the protagonist young man who sells blair witchrelated memorabilia from his website nthe movie then cuts to title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while cigarettesmoking doctor luridly leers above him nwe see him throwing himself wildly around padded room we see him cowering naked in shower stall as fire hose is turned on him nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again ni had sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is sure sign that you are in the throes of truly horrible movie nthe movie cuts again this time to the present nthe young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website nwe meet tristen and steven young couple who are writing book about the blair witch experience nsteven is skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria ntristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence nshe is wan and softspoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out nhow did know nbecause in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant nthe fourth member of their party is erica wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was good witch not evil nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in cemetery nkim is dressed completely in black has extreme gothstyle makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect its never explained nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the nights events nthere is brief encounter with rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down nsexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens nthis would be great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary nthe next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow nthe videotapes are missing but thanks to psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found nooh nspooky nthe team goes back to jeffreys house creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night nwacky hijinks ensue ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird runelike burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in handbasket nthroughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards nwhen they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes nokay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nnevermind nthis movie was awful nsimply awful nthe characters are broadlydrawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development nerica is the natureloving wiccan ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman nsteven is the overbearing asshole nkim is the antisocial goth girl nold tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic nbecause she pregnant nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl nbecause she wears lot of eye makeup nhow do we know the local sheriff is bad guy nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he straight out of deliverance nthis is weak storytelling at its worst nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action nit did nt work non top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at hospital that looks like it belongs in bad slasher movie nlets get on plane home no ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want to find out what going on ok nfrankly by the end of the movie was rooting for the witch ni also felt that there was simply too much blood gore in this film nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror nthe witch was palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact nthe horror was all offscreen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be nthis is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie nblair witch dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the grossout nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be ritual massacre of some sort nknives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care nthis movie did nt stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything nby the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours nit is all explained in fact it is all shown onscreen in loving detail ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind ni found this to be miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the directors intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all know lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with group of other people for the next week or so nand if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree nthe snowfall of manuscript paper nhm nblair witch book of shadows was horrible movie nfrom the poorlywritten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the grossout shots it was bad effort through and through
bive never been member of the robin williams fan club na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes long way and sometimes feel as though watching yearold class clown nin his films williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchyfeely emotion leading to wildly uneven performances nmrs ndoubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet nwhile it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence mrs ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up with high energy nwilliams stars as daniel hillard cartoon voiceover artist with penchant for irresponsible behavior none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda sally field and she files for divorce nunemployed living in disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children daniel decides to respond to mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper nhe turns to his brother frank harvey fierstein theatrical makeup artist and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire matronly yearold englishwoman ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on mirandas flirtation with wealthy client pierce brosnan to spend time with the children and to learn something about responsible parenting all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best nmrs doubtfire has to overcome mountain of implausibilities to work and basically it does so nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that instantly believable nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle nmore problematic was series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell its bit hard to swallow that she does nt recognize any of the voices as her husbands nperhaps the biggest contrivance were asked to swallow is that daniel could make quick change into mrs doubtfire in few minutes ntheres more to realistic makeup than slapping on latex mask nfortunately these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll nduring the film was generally too busy laughing nafter getting off to slow start involving too much of williams riffing mrs ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place ndaniels frantic attempt to fool court officer is wonderful as is the climactic restaurant sequence even though saw the resolutions coming mile away nclearly most of the credit for doubtfires success goes to robin williams nit took putting him in drag but for once he plays comic character that is nt just robin williams with different name nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foulmouthed nwisely he never aims for saintly nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity nits one of mrs ndoubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect just people trying to be better nas miranda sally field is solid in background role and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu nthe children are also good although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing nits easy to see mrs ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over and its true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common nbut mrs ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship ntheres nothing dazzlingly new in mrs ndoubtfire but there are plenty of laughs and good comedies are always in short supply nand its nice to see robin williams just act for change

bbased on the boris karloffs classic by the same name the mummy starts off with the highpriest of osiris imhotep who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible bandaged up having his tongue removed and being covered in flesheating scarab beetles then entombed all while still alive nrecap few thousand years later where soldier named rick played by brandan fraser aids young historian named evelyn played by rachel wiesz and her brother jonathan played by john hannah in finding the book of amon ra in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress using evelyn as sacrifice nwalking in with relatively low expectations thought this movie was actually pretty good nthe visuals and cgi are astounding and obviously not cheaply done at all nthey pack ton of detail into the images especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes such as unnerving moments involving flesheating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him after all those who took his artifacts are cursed nunfortunately the film attempts to be way too much in such short span of time becoming tug of war for control between genres non one hand it is fast paced action film non the other its frightening horror film nand on the side its hilarious comedy nideally for it to be successful the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect with one character serving as the comic relief that would be johnson nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief with rick occasionally delivering his witty oneliner nif they were trying to make horroractioncomedy it would have helped if it were established early on in the film but unfortunately with the backstory of imhoteps entombment that would be impossible nand then there the slapstick fight scene between swordwielding rick and an army of mummies nwhile really well done it had the feel of slapstick comedy nreplace the sword with chainsaw and you effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness nwhile entertaining and funny it feels really out of place nbut at least its break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing lot of non the whole the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end entertaining the audience nbut must end my review with plea to movie theatre owners turn nthe sound down nwhile lot of theatres have good sound systems my ears were almost ringing as walked out of the theatre the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film end of days it was so loud could nt make anything out

bcinema has been around for about hundred years now nits not my job to recap this century every time talk about new film but like to think that beginning to understand the art more as watch more films from before my time nrecently ve seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius nthey are likely to be remembered for nwell quite while ni like this film too nyes its disasterslashaction movie ntrue its budget is lot more money than ill ever see in my lifetime nand there not doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make lot of money nin fact bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable ni certainly do nt care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such skilled director that doubt he ever make film that is difficult to sit through nof course skillful direction does nt complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together nthe story is wellthought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters nyes you read that right narmageddon actually has characters you can care about nif you do nt like this film then you have problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as film like this can be nif you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film nso its up to the government to stop it why the is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated ntheir plan to send group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate nuclear warhead within nthe head driller is harry stamper bruce willis nhis group of men is colorful bunch including ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi ntheres also an interesting triangle formed between harry and grace liv tyler who is harrys daughter na nand grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad is nt too happy with the situation nits absurd to wish for complicated story in an event movie or special effects movie or whatever it is you like to call armageddon nits not about story its about viscera and action and thrillsaminute and all that stuff nits incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made film so entertaining and so visually sharp that doubt any director could have done it better ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles ntake the spectacular opening scene for instance in which meteor shower obliterates new york na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways ni like his quickedit style because its abrasive and exhausting to watch nits also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times nbut its fun to be obnoxious sometimes nthe special effects in this film put every other blockbuster to shame ndeep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable nspecial effects are very important in film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film does nt work neverything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid nthe effects that do nt look totally real are still pleasure to behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nicelooking that it actually qualifies as art nof course all of this would add up to little more than an aboveaverage light show if did nt get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action nthe film is two and half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots ni wo nt suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions are nt put forth in sentimental and overbearing way nin fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that lot more than can say about deep impact which was banking on the feelgood parts of its story nbruce willis is terrific and glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ntyler and affleck are great together and make convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on comfortable level npatton who is magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his exwife and son is very moving nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny ni was nt challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and do nt mind too much nbut the film does nt insult my intelligence its pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do nits not mindless and escapist but wellcrafted cinema nit might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget nim not saying that films like this are risky moves nwhat am saying is that armageddon is big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms

btommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse nthe fugitive nnot quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had nthere are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays parole officer not us marshall clever huh noh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not one armed man nboth movies are on video nmake the wise choice and pick the fugitive nthere are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable nwhile serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice nlearning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary nwhen the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught she going back to jail ndirector bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son nevery other scene we are given shot of libby staring and crying at his picture nin an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something nall that is needed in this type of movie is short scene in which libby tells herself or friend miss my son nnothing more nothing less ndr kimble of the fugitive did nt look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself nlibby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough nashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed costar tommy lee jones nwinning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his idomyjobwhethertheyareinnocentorguilty roles npeople still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so guess he was right nthough do nt think he will win another oscar again nthe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons neven if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count nburglary assault grand theft auto are some of libbys slipups nthe message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime nhopefully criminals wo nt use double jeopardy as reference in court for why they are innocent nthat would just be plain stupid
bthe premise of the new teentargeted horror film final destination causes recollection of memorable simpsons halloween episode nafter attempting to repair malfunctioning toaster lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created portable timemachine nafter trek into the cretaceous period homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world nagain and again homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it nthe characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence their design nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake nthat someone is death nyou see alex browning devon sawa and six others have cheated the grim reaper nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve nfor high school excursion alexs french class is traveling to paris by airline transport nalex tense and neurotic has shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in midair nin panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft nafter handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky nthe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize nbut death wo nt be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances nthe grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi nbefore delve into the meat of the review just like to confer nis that one helluva premise or what nfinal destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles episode than the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong non familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening minutes of final destination reflects that nunlike most thrillers the setup is crisp and cool nyou just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum wo nt unspool leaving us with secondstring effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks nyoung viewers have palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with know what you did last summer and sequel idle hands and movie with nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend nafter the setup when remained slouched apprehensively in my chair started to really have fun with final destination nlow and behold teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent nsome splotty logic and heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream in nfinal destination stimulates the nerves and offers exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap we ve endured throughout the past few years nnot that the characters are that good nsawa is game as alex connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend nin addition the survivors are endearing geek tod chad donella jocky controlfreak carter kerr smith of dawsons creek carters ditzy girlfriend terry amanda detmer the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock seann william scott supplier of lukewarm comic relief and lone teacher the emotionally delicate ms lewton kristin cloke naside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter varsity blues playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking nthe personality of clear is written with such vague nebulous definition that she resembles walking flashcard saying hello am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main characters plight ntoss few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and ummm nspiritual mortician former candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments nnot so nfinal destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening nthe extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murdererontheloose concept with assistance from shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick nthe plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games nbut suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes ncreative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to characters demise nwhat will trigger the accident nwill it be the john denver record just put on to play rocky mountain high yeah sick humor nwill it be the leaking toilet nthe falling fishing reel in the corner nthe murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly minute afterward na sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach nit gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares nits fun nin that simple regard final destination is my cup of tea nthis stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side nafter the show it will also have an frightening impact on you nwhen will your design expire nis death waiting around the corner nthe final effect is major case of the heebiejeebies
bbowfinger is good movie about the making of very bad one nthe screenplay written by costar steve martin skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy sciencefiction movies to chopsocky fight sequences and all in crafty and accomplished manner nanyone who knows of or has had any association with moviemaking should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for its entire duration nthe central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one nbobby bowfinger martin cheapskate and smalltime hollywood producer has always dreamed of making successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so na new script an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain has caught bowfingers eye nafter confronting bigname producer named jerry renfro robert downey jr in restaurant an agreement is made to finance the movie nbut first bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey eddie murphy to sign in on the project nkit turns the offer down immediately but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film nafter emptying out his life savings the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved and then prepares to film the movie without the stars knowledge nthe actors confront ramsey on the street saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage nthe unknowing star who is terrified of aliens and being abducted is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him nwhen the conditions become even more treacherous bowfinger is forced to hire kit ramsey lookalike named jiff also murphy sweetnatured dork who runs for coffee inbetween shooting vital scenes nthese include attempting suicide run across an lane freeway and one of the hot scenes involving supporting actress daisy heather graham removing her blouse nbowfinger takes its sweet time getting started but when the plot switches into high gear great things happen ncertain scenes are so precisely executed perfectly framing moments that are absolutely falldown funny nno hilarious nstandouts include the chase through parking garage in which ramsey who supposed to be being followed keeps checking behind him to investigate strange tapping noise its actually bowfingers dog in high heels nand just try not to laugh in the climactic kungfu sequence featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas nwhile the entire minutes of bowfinger is nt always on target individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles nmasterful comedy director frank oz dirty rotten scoundrels in and out who has never made bad movie ensures quality final product and is aided immensely by martins sharpedged script nhowever the real onscreen star is eddie murphy nthis is the actors finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early nmurphy excels at every corner not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey but in creating likable buffoon in jiff as well nthese three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise and the reward is virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs nsteve martin generates the power behind bowfinger but murphy fuels it nthis is summertime comedy that unlike something such as american pie and south park does nt break any rules nbut its still just as uproarious or perhaps even more sidesplitting than anything we ve seen this season nthe supporting cast including christine baranski as workloving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman all perform well within their limits nthe only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top ngraham attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers girl in ap displays cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay ni would nt be caught dead buying ticket for chubby rain but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough
bseen july at the crossgates cinema albany ny theater at with my mom using hoyts cinema cash ntheater rating very good sound picture and seats nits very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life nall stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do ntherefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does in such crafted intricate and entertaining manner nits crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself nthe film takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war nthis plays major factor in the films success nto use such historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy nit might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers ncan story set so long ago be relatable now nthe film confronts all these problems paradoxically by not cronfronting them nit does nt simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant nbuilding strong foundation is important to all forms of media without which what is there to build on nwere given some backstory here and learn little about our characters especially our main character scarlett ohara leigh beautiful southern belle with will of steel cunning wit and tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time nshe knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play role in the shaping of her life and those around her nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be nbeing the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men and their women to ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious nwho will be the one to get her food or subtle ngetting married just to spite someone nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes howard modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him nhe is nt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact he engaged to woman with personality much more like his nher name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see nshe and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but does nt give her much emotional selfdefense nacting catalyst to the love triangle and to the story as whole is the daper stongwilled cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable nhes quite character all right everyone listens to what he has to say even though he got bad reputation nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior nhe tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill does nt seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition nfor example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out nthis angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factories ndo we have food ndo we have navy nall we have is tobacco nall true statements and yet the south still insists he wrong nbutler is shifty character to be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know he not going to stop until he has her nbut scarlett ca nt get past her need for ashley and during scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever nand so the story goes on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story nsome are vital for only few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film nin most films only few characters exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates supporting cast the size of small town and everyone has signficance neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for real sense of time and place nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is none scene has scarlett working as nurse at military hospital while we hear soldier in the background screaming no nnot my leg ndont cut off my leg nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning that more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be nas the second half begins the film concentrates more on scarlett as completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has ca nt help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett neach uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett ca nt help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business nthey say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization nthey need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together nperhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves it up to us to make this call nboth have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why ngable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture nall nnone neither way is possible and its mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewings nits safe to say most of us wo nt live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone with the wind but its still masterpiece for its ability to give us sense that we ve just experienced lifes worth of joy and pain
bever watch very young child try and tell joke that is beyond his or her sophistication nits full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined ni felt the same way watching drowning mona nskip stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy nthere are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing nthere is running gag about the town verplanck being test town for the then new yugo neveryone drives yugo differentiating their cars with personalized license plates neven the police chief drives one nthere is certain sublimeness to the image of lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets nthere also is running gag about one of the characters jeff missing hand and how it occurred nit pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends nit turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend nthere are some sight gags that pop up as well such as monas tombstone which reads demoted instead of devoted nstill the core of the story maintains the flatness of still pond nthe lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona midler neach scene with her is the same scream at someone hit someone then scream some more ntheres no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness nanyone off the street could have played the role such as it is nthe other characters are walking cardboard cutouts neach one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization nthere is burly female car mechanic so of course there is forced lesbianism gag nmonas son jeff marcus thomas is simpleton hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth nchief of police rash devito likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter ntheres nothing more to him nelle the chiefs daughter campbell is bland personified dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have child and be married nmonas husband phil fichtner jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch nbob affleck elles betrothed and business partner to jeff is mumbling obvious dullard nthere is no contrast to any of the characters nby having at least one character with some wit or wits to serve as counterpoint to the others perhaps steinfelds attempt at satirizing small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better nostensibly murder mystery drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer who could be anyone due to monas loving manner with everyone on town neven that aspect of the film fails throwing in convenient ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things nits been while since walked away from movie theater in an angry mood nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that rarely remember comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at its ineptitude
bwell if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you nbecause that all that there really is ni found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot nfor one thing white leading actor who has black daughter does leave some curiosity ni am not saying that this is nt possible nbut it does leave one to wonder nknow did nanother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out nand certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations nthere was one scene that should have been short nbut it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it found myself thinking nok enough already get on with it nthere are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do nthings just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort nanother thing that noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning nthis movie is also very predictable nyou can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at given moment ngranted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you nalso some of the things that happen are little too predictable and several cliques are repeated nit gets boring at times to tell you the truth neven though there is still action going on nanother little point might add is that the main character is supposed to be quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero nsome of the characters are not proper for their roles nthe acting is fine but the characters just do nt seem to add up nif was to base my review totally on the plot then would nt rate this movie too highly but that just the thing this movie is nt just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done nthe whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really movie nthe special effects are just amazing you ca nt tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just would nt be able to say that the creature was nt there during filming extinct or not nanother thing is the destruction scenes nwow those were masterpieces nwell some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dinos make this one of the reasons to see this movie nthis movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office nunfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do ni may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments ngo see it in matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me none little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock think that some people really want money badly nand think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have chance nyou know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made ni thought put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick nits not that bad movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this

brichard linklaters slacker made in for budget of only immerses itself in the twentysomething collegetown culture of austin texas nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning ntheir lifestyle is sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue career after graduation they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy the pervasiveness of slave morality the subtle messages in pop culture and such nask them what they ve been doing lately and they ll more likely than not reply oh you know just hanging out nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters the camera follows one person for few minutes then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person who walks into diner just as another person is walking out the door nits certainly lot of fun listening to these characters talk some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas some of them are just plain weird and some of them think their ideas are lot more profound than they really are nthe opening monologue delivered by linklater himself to taxi driver tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy while groups of pseudointellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle briberybased morality in scoobydoo nfor the most part however the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types nnear the beginning paranoid man follows pedestrian for several blocks warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars nanother man seems to be collecting televisions keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of graduate student who recorded himself having nervous breakdown and destroying the camera nand in scene that drew big laugh from everyone present when saw the film man tries to achieve closure after failed relationship by reciting poetry on bridge and then throwing typewriter into the creek below nthe only problem with slacker is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end nsince linklater only spends few minutes with each character the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after while nthere are only so many times you can hear hey what going on not much what are you up to nothing really just hanging around before it gets on your nerves the film might well have benefited from slightly slower pace and little bit more characterization nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half jfk buff for example seems like pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist and many of the characters just generally are nt as weird or unique ninstead of depicting city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first linklater shows us the oddballs first then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too slacker is good film and wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy whatever its flaws and its status as cult classic is welldeserved ni just ca nt help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order
bwhen it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy expect negative reviews from critics left and right npredictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years nwhat really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while sitting in the theater nam enjoying myself nis this comfortable break from my week of finals nthis is why have given films like final destination or road trip high marks had party of time wasting my money on something wo nt remember next week nso last week opened up the new york times and no surprise boys and girls got negative review ndaily news nnegative nreelviews nnegative nepinions com nnegative nthis was nothing new namerican pie final destination road trip did nt get such hot reviews and loved those guilty pleasures nsame goes for she all that formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded nsince boys and girls reunites she all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr predicted vu al over again nbut still curious asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reactions were far from positive ni had made up my mind ill catch it on video or cable in couple of years nbut soon after following series of unexpected events we could nt get into shaft because it is rated found myself watching boys and girls nwhoops nboys and girls is about nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani nbriefly meeting as preteens and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends nbut in the movies male and female can not be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other nwith advice from their roommates amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found ni could hardly sit through the minute running time for several reasons nthe dialogue is probably the worst have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to nit is almost offensive nan example of an insightful conversation you re dumb ndumb dumb dumb dumb no followed by mandy mooreesque tune background well its not as bad as wing commander guess nthe supporting cast is also painfully useless ndetmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots nand although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex prinze jrs ryan dominates the screen while forlanis jennifer simply acts as dilemma for him to work with nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character nteenager or not you ll hate this movie guarantee it nmaybe should rent she all that again nis it really as good as think it is

bperhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with condescending attitude nhis shtick was marked by crassness nin this movie for example when his girlfriend says that she kicking him out because he been fired from different jobs over the last months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex nthis kind of humor can only go so far but certainly ca nt go the distance in fulllength feature dirty work is nothing more than sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically nemotionally they ve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in beginning flashback nalthough having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you ticket then dump bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart nmitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with in period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have heart operation ntheir idea is to start revengeforhire business where they ll do your dirty work nin the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of live television shoot at nearby used car lot ntheir presence is established but when lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge nby default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material nexcept for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as prank phone call nalready weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes very unfunny chevy chase as bumbling doctor with gambling addiction nbut what really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self there always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like were just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live nmuch like the television show for minutes we get one or two funny bits nthe rest of the story is just dead space
bi wonder if budget is at all criterion for whether or not movie can be considered an exploitation flick ntake the professional for example nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography couple of recognizable name actors and couple of fairly impressive explosions nits also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features central relationship between middleaged man and twelveyearold girl with decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension nthe professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant nthe professional of the title is new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated none day he is forced to let someone into his life when girl from his apartment building knocks on his door nher name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired nagent norman stansfield gary oldman after matildas father tried to rip him off nleon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother nthe two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both nwriterdirector luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita slick potboiler about female assassin nthere is no question that besson can make great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created film chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting nbut beneath the shiny wrapper there is nt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given character to develop nleon is mostly collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for hired killer he really not so bad guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies njean reno succeeds at giving leon haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda nnatalie portman is all wrong for part that called for much grittier quality but she does nt have too much to work with either nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is scene where matilda shocks hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for cheap gag ngary oldmans entire part is something of cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch nthere is nt real person to be found anywhere in the professional which is nt always problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of twelveyearold in really distasteful way nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matildas relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he going to show them forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching child to load mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty na great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world ca nt disguise that fact
ladybugs is typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield nthis picture does nt play like comedy for children so who is it aimed at nand why is it told like minute sitcom instead of feature film nrodney dangerfield stars as chester lee total schmuck working at huge corporation nhe obviously does nt have lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead which he does by volunteering to coach the companys girls soccer team nwhat shock to learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem to know even less ni did nt laugh but for some reason it did nt annoy me that much nchesters fiancee bess graff thinks he got promotion in addition to the coaching position and of course she has slacker for son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams njonathon brandis is nice surprise as matthew who agrees to dress up as girl named martha to help out chester probably because the girl he has crush on plays on the team what original story ideas nwhat we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed with some cross dressing nunfortunately the film is nt smart enough to play upon the drag aspect nin fact it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable ncould it be any more obvious martha is boy nhe only wears girls wig without any makeup and they do nt even give him falsies nbrandis does nt bother to mimic girls voice either nthen there is pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for dress but for what reason nmartha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy dress for her njust when we think the martha character is going to be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for new plot to pick up on nwhen bess discovers what really going on she breaks up with chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss nthis film could ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that ntheres just too much of sitcom feel here especially during the socalled serious moments and all the confusion between the characters nive seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it does nt seem as bad as it is ndangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what price
bgregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made nso why did see his latest teen bisexual angst opus nfirst of all some of the reviews were fairly positive nalso the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising nlast of all wanted to give arraki one more chance ni mean the guy ca nt be that untalented can he nthe answer to that question is three letters long nnowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles nsince arraki does nt know how to make anything coherent its hard to describe the plot nlets just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wo nt make commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls nthe only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as teen who has chance encounter with famous tv star nhe turns out to be nice guy who does nt care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans nthis story has shocking twist and tragic end that did not see coming nit is the first time ever felt any compassion for character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez ni thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft nhe works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes nhalfway through the film did nt necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like considerable improvement on the doom generation nthen as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions nits sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face such renegade maverick filmmaker look what can do attitude nthe performances are generally better than in the doom generation which is nt saying much nat least we do nt have to suffer jonathan am the most hideous man in america schaech nwe are however treated to another round of james more wooden than keanu duval nsarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of and now arrakis wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess nof the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as deranged right wing tv evangelist nif prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture nmaybe greg arraki does nt want you to like his characters nmaybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them nmaybe he just wanted to piss me off nif so he was successful

bwhy do so many childrens films treat their target audience with utter contempt ntoo many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just ca nt handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues the iron giant which was directed and cowritten by brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it film that enjoyable for both children and adults alike nhogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is spirited young lad who lives with his hardworking single mother annie jennifer aniston in small town in maine nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception nhe comes across giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food nafter saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as pet of sorts nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like lost puppy nrealizing he ca nt just keep the giant in barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him to junkyard owned by dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth ca nt keep the giant secret forever because government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant threat to national security nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarths house as lodger nmeanwhile the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be weapon of some kind the iron giant is exactly what family films ought to be because it doesn talk down to its audience nthe story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends young boy nits very similar to the spielberg classic and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielbergs film such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy nthe film delivers several serious messages the most important of which is ones ability to choose ones own fate nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be hero nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate though wo nt give it away will say that very few will be disappointed nthe animation while not up to disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough to make you forget you re watching cartoon nthe giant is computeranimated while the human characters are all handdrawn the oldfashioned way nthe characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother nharry connick jr does nice characterization as dean and really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tvs frasier as an army general called in by agent mansley nunlike several cartoon features each character is actually developed personality rather than stereotype and is actually integral to the plot rather than being superfluous comicrelief sidekick clich disney still has nt ditched ndean for example could have been stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems to suggest that but he is presented as character with real emotions thoughts and motivations neven the heavy agent mansley is not villain who does bad things simply because he wants to but out of his own fear and paranoia na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paperthin stereotypes and figure the kids wo nt mind but the iron giant has clearly put little work into making the characters real and it pays off nthe film is nt only around to deliver heavyhanded messages though nits also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things such as dive into pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to outlast one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever nthe film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to duck and cover in the event of nuclear attack the iron giant has much more of satirical edge to it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get welltimed clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with nwhen you get right down to it the iron giant is no more than the story of boy and his robot nthe story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming nthough enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person when it comes to family entertainment simple is the way to go nits akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but its not the story that sets the film above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has in spades
bone might expect cathartic viewing experience walking into new jeanluc godard film nafter all he was founding member of the highly influential french new wave nhe is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing nhowever his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly nit is edgars bruno putzulu selfappointed task to capture these moments after recent breakup to define central idea its only when things are over that they make sense nwhether this project will end up play film or opera remains undecided nthe thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone ninstead what ensues is an hour and half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it nbut do nt fret it will surface again nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile nbut you hold hope for some time nthe background music keeps you in state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations nits only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope nand with speeches like am thinking of something but can only think of that something when am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyones interest nto godards credit he certainly knows how to frame scene nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful nwatching edgar read while walking along train track on mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him nand if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities nthe environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them nunfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words nthe second half is composed of nauseating hypercolor that often blurs the image nyou suddenly feel like doomed character straight out of scanners nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular nwhile ill grant that this does happen and tend to shy away from watching such garbage its still pointless focus for film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood nit just goes to show an intelligent person is nt necessarily an admirable storyteller nthe days of breathless are no more
bmaking sequel to widely beloved film is weighty proposition indeed especially when the first film is considered by many to be masterpiece nwhen it comes to living up to expectations filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure nfor sequel to live up to or even surpass the originals greatness is very rare indeed nand whereas babe pig in the city misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe it is worthy companion piece nmore than that it is spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right babe pig in the city warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced babe pig in the city picks up precisely where babe left off nhaving won the sheep herding competition farmer hoggett james cromwell and his pig are elevated to fame status na series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city nin doing so the film transports us into wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original babe pig in the city flourishes where so many sequels fail nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film nnot babe pig in the city nthis is completely original tale that offers up story drastically different than the first nalso by not being content to utilize most of the old characters this film gives us many new ones to enjoy nin essence it does nt attempt to copy itself ninstead it strives to achieve an originality of its own nand it succeeds nthats not to say the familiar is absent babe pig in the city retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film nalong with babe himself ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride as does mrs hoggett one of this decades best and most underappreciated comic characterizations hilariously performed by magda szubanski nthe three singing mice also make the journey chiming in with their cute highpitched vocals nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice nfrom there we are guided once again by roscoe lee brownes soothingly deep narrative ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting nwhile staying at the flealands hotel babe encounters veritable arkfull of new animals nmonkeys kittens and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new urbanites that babe befriends as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter neach character is distinctly unique some of which are imbued with personal humanlike struggles that are endearing and touching nand while this world focuses largely on these animals we are introduced to two new human characters as well nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel an animalloving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors nsteins landlady is wonderfully odd caricature nwe also meet fugly floom an old softspoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel utilizing them as part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions nnot having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was nso as not to ruin this wellkept secret wo nt reveal the actors identity here nit was treat indeed to see one of cinemas legends grace the screen again in what was superbly gentle and heartwarming performance nthe greatest triumph of babe pig in the city is the art direction nsimply putit bleeds creativity taking the look of the original film to whole new level nrestricted primarily to farm the first time around this second installment creates an entire city dazzling us with unique fablelike architecture nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our worlds architectural landmarks ndesigning skyline that includes the statue of liberty the sydney opera house the brooklyn bridge the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower ford has created singular city that encompasses all of our cities as seen in the film photo and preproduction drawing to your right nadded to that many of this citys streets are the twin siblings of venices gondolatrekked rivers nthe metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is wondrous sight to behold nit is world that you want to walk around in nnorma moriceaus costume designs belong in this world vibrant in color and style equal to that of the fords landscape nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly flooms clown outfit nandrew lesnies photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the films multiple emotional tones nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of babe pig in the city nreports stated that its original cut was branded with pg rating nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned pg rating nbut even so to be anything harsher than the original rating had many parents and fans up in arms nby deleting minimal number of shots babe pig in the city was eventually given the coveted rating nalthough appeased many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself nwell to coin phrase the reports of babe pig in the city death at the hands of dark scary felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated ngranted it has its moments of pseudomorbidity but allinall babe pig in the city is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be nwhatever dark moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller the mad max trilogy the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil nhaving served as producer and cowriter on the first film miller moves into the directors chair for this one putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise nthe story of babe pig in the city is an enchanting yarn but one that does nt achieve the emotional or character depth of the original nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity an individuals worth challenging conformity and ones purpose in life babe dealt with this weighty subject matter creating timeless fable babe pig in the city should not have rehashed these themes but do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife class differences sacrificial courage and so on nbut this films goals are nt as lofty as the firsts instead choosing to take more straightforward approach allowing its themes to take back seat to an exciting sometimes intense fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive babe pig in the city also decides against developing relationship to the level of which was present in the first film specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe nhoggetts love for babe which grew ever so gently is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality nbest exemplified in hoggetts dance for babe this moving relationship was truly unique nit is something that wish would have been present again and could have through fugly floom but was not nplease understand these are not negative criticisms per se but simply statements of what see as the differences between babe pig in the city being very good film and the original being great one nbut having said that these observations are minor critiques at best nas an overall piece babe pig in the city is thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end nsure it is nt great film but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness nit is film that is magical with its charm and humor exciting in its adventurous exploits funny with its dry wit and cute voices and breathtaking in its presentation babe pig in the city may not be moviemaking at its absolute best but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema nas result if you choose to let this film pass you by you will be missing of the years best cinematic treats
bthe high school comedy seems to be hot genre of the moment nwith she all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance nhowever you would nt know it from the quality of the latest entry jawbreaker nthis shockingly bitter candy definitely has sour center nthe most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma nthey have accidentally killed one of their own the teen dream liz purr charlotte roldan choked on giant jawbreaker during kidnapping prank for her th birthday nnow the three surviving girls must decide what to do nit takes little time at all for the groups leader courtney rose mcgowan to decide to cover it up nthe ditzy marcie julie benz is game to go along but the cliques final member julie rebecca gayheart has guilty conscience nto make things worse another student the hopelessly geeky fern mayo judy evans greer accidentally discovers the truth nthe girls cover is surely blown nnot so fast nthinking quickly courtney offers fern onceinalifetime chance nafter quick makeover fern is transformed into vylette the beautiful new girl at school and fullfledged member of the popular crowd ndoes this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder nor will this finely honed plan crack over time njawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation and failing miserably might add nit manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations but misses three crucial elements sharp dialogue witty characters and the muchneeded humor nit is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being darkly humorous if it was nt shackled to its deadweight plot nthe films most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo nat this point jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths nbut then all of sudden the innovation stops nthe film becomes mired in the murderandcoverup plotting which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film nin the film rose mcgowan fares the best nas the manipulative clique leader she truly dominates every scene she in not difficult feat in crowd such as this however nits character crying out for better movie or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact njawbreaker does nt quite know how to handle its semilikable characters fern and julie neither one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows nthe lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters nas their motives become murky and unclear the film finally falls to the point that it does nt really matter who wins or loses since all sides have become equally detestable detestable is good word to describe the film jawbreaker nits certain that like the murder weapon described in the films title jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience
bafter watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat bowl of ramen the same way again nthere is scene where an old man is teaching young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying see you soon nof course its meant to be parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with certain degree of sobriety nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience nexperiencing it is process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts ntrust me you really want to go find noodle shop at this point njuzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan na stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of small holeinthewall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka ngoro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious ngoro finds that tampopos ambition is to have shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat bowl of her ramen nthe problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing nhowever goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems ntake for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for delicious soup from another shop owner nthe price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for more affordable sum ntampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to back room nshe protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists njust when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with joy that can be felt by the audience nthis scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery ntheres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of restaurant and expertly prepares french omelet nthe scene is meant to bring laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all nthere are also number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives na particularly effective one involves wife and mother being tended to in her home by doctor nsurrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life nher husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner nthe viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this nin near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family nas the family eats she looks on them and smiles npreparing food for her family is joy and comfort to her and for brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy nthen she falls over dead nfor moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ncrying as they do so the family finishes the meal nthe scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful nby including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline ninstead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble nbecause the film parodies western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown nin this case the showdown is against the ramen nif they eat tampopos ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded nits pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it little slack
bim not really sure what to think about crash non the surface its cold boring unerotic porn with name starts name director and some cool camerawork ni mean it left me completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out nbut then again not every films supposed to leave you entertained crash is structured to play like porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair of characterization nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we do nt really see lot of the actors completely exposed nbut what makes it supremely different from porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ve seen it nif one was to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing nthe film leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present group of people who live on the edge nthe film opens up on woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against car in public air hangar nsuddenly man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind the film does nt show all this though even if it is nc nthe next scene has film director james james spader having sex with camera woman alice poon in an office on the highlypopulated set of his movie nthe next scene has the two coming together revealing to us that they re husband and wife and them sharing in one anothers escapades nwhile the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge nsoon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course he reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on njames is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in porn also alive nthe two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again nwhen james gives her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have little quickie as they were aroused by the accident nyou would nt think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutchcarrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it to another level he loves to recreate famous car crashes nin one scene he and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james deans car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get rush and the attention of the police nsoon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex nwhile this is admittingly all bit comical the film is almost like black comedy the film does do pretty awesome portrayal of people who main fetish is living on the edge nim sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents but personally do nt see connection between car crashes and sex nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give definite rush nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting minimasterpieces were at first not sure if they ll take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp nthen when it happens we hold our breath nthe same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion nthese people are merely taking it to another level nthe only problem with the film is that its tad redundant na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and half nthis goes on for about minutes and it just seems little too long nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are tad on the boring side ntheres no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey its porn and were not here to sympathize nbut still they coulda cut it down bit nbut the film is saved with its presentation as well as some other elements nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating kind of cool weird feeling nand there are several scenes are just amazing none scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with man which sounds almost erotic the way she says it na sequence involving one characters death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs nand the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of car crash and couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that she wounded nthe acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in porn nwhile james spader is pretty boring he usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing nshe speaks all her words in almost zombielike hushes and when she having sex she has blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether she enjoying it or not nin one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her nholly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds kinda cool kinkiness to her role nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone nhe often speaks as he is out of breath showing definite affinity for his way of life nhe has great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where he taking photographs of picture and later scene where he getting freaky tatoo nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing later scene nkosteas is little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows denirolike presence hinting that he capable of bigger roles nwhile hardly enjoyed crash its still pretty intriguing portrayal of group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world nthese people are able to share rush between two completely different entities and the film which does nt exactly pain them in negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc rating there also an rrated version but would nt even go near that thing anyone looking for quick turnon should just rent regular porno
bits been long time since walt disney has delivered us classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast nsure there have been delightful outings like last years hercules nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking nwith the release of the studios newest feature length film remake of edgar rice burroughs creation tarzan disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques nits no classic but this new tarzan represents exactly what family film should be nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline as tarzans parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire and find shelter in the jungles of africa nbut they are killed offscreen by the snarling cheetah sabor leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib nfound by kala voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close kindhearted mother and member of gorilla pack tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own nwe follow the young boy through the years as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk very brash but funny rosie odonnell and clumsy elephant tantor wayne knight nof course in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero nin tarzan these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced nas tarzan grows to manhood the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture nhere the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton brian blessed who accompanying hapless professor nigel hawthorne on an expedition through the jungle nof course there the professors daughter jane nicely vocalized by cheerful minnie driver who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied breathtaking element to the movement of the athletic title character and the fastpaced editing is absolutely marvel nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops narrowly escaping pack of nasty baboons he slips and slides like daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave nyour eyes can barely keep up its fantastic accomplishment nthe subject matter here is also notch or two above animation average nthere are important questions raised about tarzans place in the world and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward which is surprising plus that was nt expecting to find here nsuffice to say this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained nthe grownup tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn who made name for himself as the big mean jerk from ghost ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who not aware of his worlds dangers nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother and lance henriksen from tvs millennium is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of human child nas the movies villain there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm but he is nothing compared to james woods hilarious hades from hercules na burley guy with big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an alltogether noticeable screen presence nstill this is one great thrillride that disney has constructed ni never expected rice burroughs work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation nor with so much emotional depth nparents along with all the kiddies are going to find much to like in tarzan

bupon first viewing of this movie the phrases been there and done that come quickly to mind nspy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series nstealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff nwhat little plot there is involves dick steele aka nagent wd leslie nielsen trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith nalong the way to it goal goal the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act nthe trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny or at the least satirical nspy hard achieves neither as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films nthe dick the world is in danger nwhat is it nwell its big roundish ball floating in space around the sun paraphrasing type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film each time getting progressively less funny nwhat they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue ndirector rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors especially nielsen who can do this quite well than on the delivery and context of their lines much of the time cutting the punchline short nthe whole film seems to be in race with itself to be over as is evident in the final sequence where there is no comedic denouement after the climax nas was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context none of the more amusing was captain of the enterprise james nt kirk noverall thought this was very weak effort nwhile all of the right films to spoof were chosen they used none of the right spoofing methods nnext time they should spy little bit harder excellent none of kind nmust see entertaining nworth the price of admission fair nnothing much special what were they thinking

bplaywright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeares works nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare mean really who does nt think of shakespeare as guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write play without exploding into passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare nand despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year nits so rare that picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written nit could have been smug selfimportant movie that panders to diehard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you ve ever read play by shakespeare or know anything about his life its likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love njoseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from lifes more serious problems debt plague etc nhes commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson nshakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work nhe begins work on comedy about boy named romeo and girl named ethel nthis all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps radiant gwyneth paltrow young heiress set to marry the financiallyoriented lord wessex colin firth nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be man to try out for the part of romeo nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeares writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he clearly man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense great deal of affection and care nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene nfiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance ve seen her in nthe two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh nof course it does nt hurt that they have masterful script to work with nstoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid ndirector john madden does fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of lesser director nim going to have to see the movie again certain there are numerous references that missed nin fact doubt its possible to gather everything with just one viewing nstoppard is master of detail you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time ntheres also brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openlyhomosexual rupert everett is joke in of itself proposing slightly twisted explanation to marlowes mysterious death in pub ntheres also scene featuring wideeyed dog that is so funny that hurt myself laughing there no dog in this play no nno dog nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has great role as thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously nben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrows and in humor he has some of the best oneliners in the movie ncolin firth always stuck playing the sap does good job being hateful njudi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words nmy single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that feel like could have been more moved by the end nthe story is moving but there are few missed opportunities in the final scenes nbut my quibbling is not important nwhat is important is that acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced nshakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them its film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync nits also movie that has the potential to introduce lot of people to shakespeares work in positive way without seeming condescending or superior ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it
baccording to hollywood movies made in last few decades life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to human being neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark godforsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience non the other hand it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view nthis film is amarcord comedy by famous italian director federico fellini which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense ninstead we follow one year in italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs as well as series of local often very colourful characters nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist year old boy titta played by bruno zanin and chronicles his sexual frustrations obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca played by magali noel problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family as well as troubles his father played by armando brancia have with mussolinis fascist regime namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film and it probably explains why it is very popular even among those people who actually do nt like federico fellinis work very much nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film word amarcord is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase remember in local italian dialect nin the same way the word is distorted so is the past in memories of those who remember it nafter the premiere fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film but it does nt matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellinis childhood or not any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film nfellinis views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images ncharacters look like caricatures actors playing them often deliberately overact and women especially those who fuel tittas sexual fantasies often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions nevery now and then scenes that depict reality gradually slide into fantasies of movies characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions nbecause of that almost everything in this film looks different and in most cases better than it would have looked in the real life neven the fascism gets fellinian makeover fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history and opportunity for comedy nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour nunlike many of his italian colleagues in who had used period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda fellini does nt care that much about politics nlack of selfrighteous moral perspective is compensated with fellinis humanistic approach to his characters neach of them regardless of age gender social class or physical appearance is given opportunity to express his or her views dreams and fears nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of th century and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable melancholic and even tragic moments nfellini could nt produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave very personal touch to this movie nvignettes are nt memorable because of the characters only fellini uses camera painting film in bright colours especially in the scenes that depict characters fantasies nfellini also knows how to use locations whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel brightcoloured beach or rural countryside neven the downtoearth streets of rimini where everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension during the snowfall non the other hand lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellinis longtime associate nino rota nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable most popular and

bhey ve got great idea for movie nok here it is well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so nwhats that nsounds too boring nok how about this then we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are in pain nlooks nwhats that nthat still does nt sound funny to you nhow about if we through in some ewwwww nlooks nstill not funny nif you answered no that does nt sound funny then ding ding ding nyoure absolutely correct nfor richer or poorer is moronic farce about rich married couple played by tim allen and kirstie alley who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant wayne knight best know as newman on tvs seinfeld gets them in trouble for tax evasion nwhat ensues is badly scripted and horribly directed minutes of cinema hell nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs nnamely talent nbacking up the married couple is brad and caroline sexton allen and alley popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else but in reality are on the brink of divorce njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from its final thread brad discovers that his accountant bob lachman knight has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sextons names nthe irs catches on but since everything points back to the sextons and not lachman there is nothing much to do nexcept run away and join an amish community nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us couple of chuckleoutloud moments and even some decent laughs here and way over there but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn nalley is absolutely unwatchable and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade which inform you was total nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons nor are they very convincing as an amish couple nthis entire movie is one bad illconceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing nits such trite stereotypical script that imagine the actors that were cast noticing that they re all predominantly tv figures were probably the only ones they could get nbryan spicers directing does nt help one bit either nin fact listing spicers filmography which includes the first power rangers movie and the big screen adaption of mchales navy is more of an insult than sum nnow that ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground will let you in on the best thing about it nit bumped seven films up notch on my worst of movie list nthats right thanks to this film ranking at number for the years worst six films are now not seemingly as bad and smile like yours previously inhabiting the number ten spot now does nt have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list nif you look at it in that respect for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all

bjust in time for halloween and christmas the reissue of the nightmare before christmas could nt be more appropriate nwith all of the attention thrown to family films in recent years namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters its high time we raised the intellectual level of childrens fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios nwith that in mind it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago nnightmare is the story of one mans quest to discover his true purpose in life to look beyond the accolades of his peers the achievements of his years and the praise of his ego njack skellington the pumpkin king of halloweentown is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere nbut during his reign as pumpkin king jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday nafter the completion of one particular halloween season jack walks with heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world nimagine his surprise to discover christmastown far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween surrounded by happy elves making toys and with good cheer all around nupon his return to halloweentown jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping sandy claws employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children nhe then aims to take over the role as primary joyprovider and giftbearer to the children of the world in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had nalas the comingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads psychotic wooden ducks sleigh pulled by phantom dog with lighted nose and large sinister singing bag named oogie boogie ntim burton the man behind such great films as ed wood beetlejuice peewees big adventure and edward scissorhands is the creative force behind nightmare noriginally burton authored poem that became the basis of the storyline and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture nthe stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film with bold colors imaginative character design and its simple yet compelling story nthe direction of harry selick who also directed james and the giant peach is strong offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters nalso memorable are the songs in the film written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman the next john williams of film composing nthe nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone nits not just childs play for the holidays its movie about how to be truly happy in tough world saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are without compromise nwhat better message is there for christmas
ban american werewolf in paris is failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis feature an american werewolf in london nwhere the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sitcoms nwhere the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny nin short while an american werewolf in london has become something of minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity nthe film opens with trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do little bungee jumping nsoon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all nshe jumps but andy with bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of major headache nserafine disappears but smitten andy seeks her out nhowever once he learns his wouldbe girlfriends dark secret he wishes he had nt nshes werewolf cursed to change into hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered nasty bite himself nactress julie delpy is far too good for this movie nshe imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate nthis is nt necessarily good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as completely mindless campy entertainment experience ndelpys injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with better script and better cast surrounding her ndelpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowskis white and richard linklaters before sunrise nshe was radiant charismatic and effective in both ngiven the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives nit could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one miss nand if your primary objective is catching glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts nthe rest of the cast acts at level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay ntom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like he in madefortv movie nit would be kind to call him bland nactors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andys friends are no more impressive njulie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat nand respected french actor thierry lhermitte has brief turn as another monster meal non the technical side its all bad news nthe computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal nthe creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits nrepeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolfs pointofview approach that interesting the first couple of times its employed then becomes tedious nand the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the onscreen action they re matched to ndirector anthony waller who displayed confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel nas result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is werewolf will give waller credit for killing off dog though something that rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in bad movie sort of way but that dubious distinction nultimately its an unfortunate effort for while it is nt unbearable to sit through it is nt howl either
bstar wars episode the phantom menace nreview by matt pusateri nfew movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star wars nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture narguably more americans today can explain what the force or jedi is than budget deficit or serb nso years after the release of the original and years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ncan new storyline and new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons nagainst this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither flop nor disappointment nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking nit is worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films nas the film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor quigon jinn liam neeson nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle trade dispute that has developed into blockade of the planet naboo by shifty trade federation nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of planetary invasion rushing to protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman nlater after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice non tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts nquigon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being galactic savior the innocentlooking yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader ncomplicating matters further is mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul nif the plot sounds bit complicated it is nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakins turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy nbut the complexity is not overwhelming nthe story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode none of the reasons the films story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused nits unclear whose story phantom menace is nin the original trilogy the movies were clearly lukes story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight nbut its unclear whether this new film is anakins story or obiwans nif this trilogy is centered on anakin its shaky foundation nlloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as result his character seems shallow and unimpressive non screen we see nothing that suggests dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing to believe he is the one nthe rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight nmcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility nportman fits the role of young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them nindividually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series nbut unlike the previous trilogy lucas does nt do as good of job playing the characters off one another nin star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obiwan and leia and luke nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities nin the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other nindividually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers nbut despite the need for richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining nfirst of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates nthe characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetianlooking planet of naboo watch spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council neach location is elaborate and complex nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines nmost of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just were nt possible when the films were made nmore than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters nthe best such character is watto greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves nwatto has scratchy italian voice and short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like hummingbird as he floats around the room nof all the computergenerated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable nspeaking of computergenerated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks nwith more than minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy njar jar clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jons accidental sidekick njar jar usually performs comicrelief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors nhowever despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar is nt completely convincing nhe still moves and sounds too much like cartoon to blend into scene nthroughout the movie jar jar never transcends roger rabbit like presence nyou accept that he there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character ninitially found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film non my second viewing of the film jar jar was lot of fun and did nt mind him at all na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates ndespite all the films struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about ones destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously nfortunately lucas has nt lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art nfrom the bumbling jar jar to oneman twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the films thrilling podrace sequence to cameo appearance by nin the film the phantom menace is simply lot of fun with lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed nand finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action nfrom beginning to end there are lightsaber battles hairraising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil nthe podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obiwan quigon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed nthe phantom menace wo nt win any major oscars nit probably wo nt beat titanics box office record nand its not even the best star wars film put it third after the original and the empire strikes back nbut its an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster nthe film ca nt live up to its hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that nbut its still worth seeing nprobably more than once
bgeorges polti once wrote paper called the thirtysix dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirtysix different situations nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes there nothing new under the sun nthe faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion ntheres not measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream credit gives us horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall nmaking use of cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence daystyle but rather through the back door nparasitic aliens take over the faculty of rundown high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day nthe lack of gusto is the movies major stumbling block neven though the genre has seen movies that have lack for quality such as this they ve been saved by an energetic approach nthis casts more than shadow of doubt on williamsons ability who enjoyed success with the wes cravendirected scream but could nt pull anything solid in for this outing or know what you did last summer nalthough he designs the faculty with more of scifi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in steel cage match and see who comes out alive non that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns nonly the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers nperhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these upandcomers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that they all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty la dawsons creek nneedless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be nthere is moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction to make any use of it nin sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off

bthe catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes it was nt me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is williams ca nt take all the blame but he sure ca nt justify himself with his own simple tag line either nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was young boy turning the clothes dryer into mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at poster of the earth nas yearold fred has nt grown up much but at least he somewhat closer to his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa nwhen an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void nfred nyes although he an obviously klutzy moron nasa does nt think twice about throwing him into rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known nfor the first part of the film we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play nhis passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats much to the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records noverbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist nfrom here on out we are subjected to one lame gag after another dealing with snot laxatives and flatulence nyou know standard kid movie material nalmost sounding like poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role nwe get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it nwhile he not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany stupid comedy he just as unlikeable nto say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny nwhy nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such role his performance is too understated and boring nclassic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy nstan laurel for example was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him npeter sellers as inspector clouseau was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at its best nwilliams on the other hand ca nt garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory nas for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever nthis is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema massproduced less than mediocre over priced and hard to stomach ngiving it oneandahalf stars is extremely generous but even ill admit to laughing few times nthe amazing thing is that even in theater packed with little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children ni must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they did nt crack up over every little thing nthen again maybe they were asleep nsome people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults are nt the targeted audience and therefore are nt meant to and wo nt enjoy them nsadly its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right na twohour still shot of dog with cartoonish voice over could entertain lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast which could easily do the same thing nand saying that parents perspective is nt important is quite poor theory to have when they re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place
bfull metal jacket very much like every other hardhitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america nthis film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war nhowever full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp nthese sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though found the later portions to be equally stunning nas in platoon full metal jacket gets off to quick start nthe opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved nfrom there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor lee ermey napparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations nprivate joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent donofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt nhartman nthe film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on nthe entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt nhartman continues on nprivate pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor nhe continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop nthat is until sgt nhartman comes up with new plan nhe will punish the rest of the soontobemarines for pyles goofups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can npyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take turn for the worst npyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of marine nafter graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service nhe is not member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat nwhen he sets out on documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start njoker joins up with platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way nhe also soon finds himself in position in which he must fight or die nagain as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an antiwar film or not na few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide nfull metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of young man in vietnam as have others in the past nthis film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others nthat again is up for debate and depends on your opinion none thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to nunfortunately many did
ba highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto russian science vessel nwell this is the point where the movie strays from becoming decent and original movie and simply becomes predictable scifi thriller nanyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then hapless crew on tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable nthe story is full of very shallow characters that do nt do much other than subsist nthe captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his nto add to this were shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in typhoon no less nnone of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in tub and someone is simply creating waves nit looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate typhoon or hurricane can not be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish nalso on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster nregardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it nas to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about nthe actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch mediocre scifi thriller then you wo nt be too disappointed nas the movie is but the latest in genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv
bthese days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows nmost of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past nbut some five or six years ago there were nt that many movies and the trend did nt look that depressing nso the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular animated series about modern stone age family were nt particularly worried when the word came about live action remake nafter all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good nthe plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of middle class america nfred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie odonnell to adopt baby nto return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets wellpaid job in management nbut of course this is just sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme nin the meantime freds wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who ca nt stand fred non the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life ncomputer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show nunfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell nbut the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters onedimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and interoffice politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film nresult is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept nafter great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version nall in all film is nt that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it
bno film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing humorous horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys eamonn owens descent into madness in ireland non one hand it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs nugent fiona shaw non another hand found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such sick needy child having been raised by drunken father stephen rea and suicidal mother aisling osullivan non yet another hand also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his for lack of better word bad deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them nhowever the butcher boys power is undeniable and the film as whole is unforgettableperhaps because it is so disturbing nwhat makes it so unsettling is the francies overall winkwink yet matteroffact attitude about everything expressed in cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie rea again nthink heavenly creatures played largely for laughs and you ll sort of understand nanchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens love francie or hate him you can not take your eyes off of owens nthe butcher boy truly is twisted unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable nin the lobby after the screening overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust that movie was so unfunny did nt know what to expect nits like something you chase for so long but then you do nt know how to react when you get it ni still do nt know how to react nmichael jordan on winning his first nba championship in or nmy thoughts after meeting him on november
bit should have been classic na great cast of respected supporting actors nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters nhowever mystery men proved to be one of the great disappointments of nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having fast paced premise nthe script tried to deliver series of small jokes throughout the film but without big laughoutloud joke and mediocre small jokes it failed miserably at being entertaining at all nthe jokes were not funny for number of reasons nthey had been used number of times before in previous films the best ones which were mediocre to begin with were ruined in the trailer and the expectation of laughing at clever unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film mystery men might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie nthe film follows band of wannabe superheroes living in wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has successful superhero captain amazing who has recently captured every evildoer in the city ncaptain amazing played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear because of his success in the past is worried that he will lose popularity nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city geoffrey rush overacting just bit too much to keep himself busy things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day nby the time this section of the plot is finished the interest for what happens if you have nt already figured it out is very low nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention nthe first scene in the film which shows the wannabes trying to save the day feels like it was seriously edited down nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folks home by some masked goons captain amazing comes in and saves the day or ruins the movie ninstead of editing this scene more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr furious ben stiller and monica waitress claire forlani or the vast majority of the film which is the heroes talking at coffee table about how their day was na simple rule more silly action is needed in order to make silly action movie work nanother major problem with mystery men is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together like bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion nhowever most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of hat paul reubens who disappeared from acting to everyones joy returns here leaving very little to be impressed about nas wannabe who uses flatulence for weapon all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of american pie and there something about mary mystery men drags on towards the end to point where anything else in the world is more entertaining nanyone with brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in helpful way nso why continue to watch nthis film is far from worthy guilty pleasure mystery men indeed does this and every time character succeeds another one congratulates him and says knew you could do it mystery men fails in every category it attempts to pass nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable nterrible acting terrible script and terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors unpredictable nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out nno ben you re the complete opposite

btim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into studio monkey whose name is used as part of multitiered marketing materials for crap movies nand here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes ni did nt expect much from this latest interpretation of pierre boulles classic novel planet of the apes ni mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligently coscripted by rod serling of twilight zone fame combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those damn dirty apes in one of his best roles of his career nsadly sat down to watch burtons version of planet of the apes and within the first minutes was checking my watch and my girlfriend big fan of the original film started to nod off nthis time around the story plays out like cross between enemy mine braveheart and project marky mark wahlberg who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter plays leo davidson hot shot air force pilot nleo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms no real explanation given in the film and leo sends one of his genetically altered smart chimps into the storms to collect data nleo and his crew lose communication with the chimp leo hops in another ship to find the monkey and then he thrown through some type of timespace wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle nleo ends up getting captured by group of talking apes and is sold to slave trader named limbo paul giamatti who in turn sells leo to chimpanzee named ari helena bonham carter nthe kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leos ship nalong the way monkeys played by tim roth overacting his role of vicious general named thade and michael clarke duncan who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in bad action movie strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages just like battlefield earth nin the end it all culminates into another braveheart ripoff human versus ape battle scene nwhile rick bakers makeup work is amazing the script is pathetic hodgepodge courtesy of three writers the acting is horrible and the surprise ending feels like swing from ballpeen hammer into the temple nwahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences nthis remake or reinterpretation as tim burton has proclaimed it is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film nthe ethical arguments about the equality of species fascism and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue an unimaginative narrative structure and romance between monkey and human neven chuck hestons antigun tirade in the de rigeur cameo seems shallow and jokey nbut the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton neven though his name is plastered across every billboard in america john badham could have directed this film neven joel schumacher could have directed this film nhe probably should have nburtons predominant themes of rejection isolation and the search for ones place in the universe as seen in ed wood edward scissorshands and peewees big adventure are completely absent in this planet ni suppose that what happen when great director gets sucked through wormhole
bcapsule in on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace nthere is lot of fighting and not whole lot of story otherwise njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct that the new film comes off as his homage to himself to njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes nfor writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake to make nghosts of mars is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between humans and surprisingly lowpowered alien menace nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct the thing and prince of darkness nit is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way nbut that still does not make for really good science fiction experience nghosts of mars takes place in the year nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the films budget nit is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earthnormal again making it easier to film nsociety has changed bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control nand from carpenters view women have really made mess of things nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in years than we might expect it to change in ten nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced by somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony ninstead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination nthe story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black ncarpenter manages to give us powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with heavy beat nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup nthe terror he creates looks little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss nhis idea of building suspense is having bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights nwithin short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars red planet and ghosts of mars nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by ni rate ghosts of mars on the to scale and on the to scale nfollowing the movie showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than did carpenters classic assault on precinct nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice
bthe job of the film critic is to see movie and write review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad ni feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but after having seen get carter really ca nt tell you what its about although could go on and on about how and why its bad movie get carter falls into that category of movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of hollywood executive board room nyou might call them the steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school of mediocre actioncrime thrillers nyou know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shootouts and car chases but really light on plot and character development nthey have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight chase or shoot at nsylvester stallone stars as jack carter las vegasbased mob enforcer who returns home for his brothers funeral nhe believes his brother richie was taken out and did nt die from dwi accident ncarters one of the most cliche badasses ever captured on celluloid nhis face alone is pretty intimidating and there quite few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his ramboontestosteronetherapy voice nstallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he does nt realize he mocking himself nthe actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death nhes in town that not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well nmickey rourke costars as one of these characters sort of crime boss who has something to do with running porno web site and blackmailing young internet tycoon played by alan cummings looking and acting lot like pee wee herman ntheres also another plot involving richies mistress secret cdrom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters stillliving relatives nim rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in way that could be remotely comprehendible ni could just rip the screenplay to shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all ni do nt like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally nyes get carter is just that complicated and complex nand what worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite nyou get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably did nt remember what had already happened and did nt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax nall you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he was nt complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes nalthough the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another nmaking movie entirely about criminals does nt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters nmel gibson starred in payback few years ago that had story not unlike this one but had such good screenplay you could nt help but like him even though he was just as bad guy as jack carter nso ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has ncarter is not likable character and you really do nt care if he gets revenge or not nthe action sequences are not at all exciting or original nthe enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all cmon you know who going to win every brawl and shootout and car chase nin the end you do nt feel nearly satisfied with the results nthe filmmakers did good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible the city is never mentioned by name but assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining

bthis is film about secrets some that are innocent like those of cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley nothers that are between married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for big corporation called fex and striving to get patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healylouie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work nand still other secrets that have greater implication for the world and are deadly in political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was business run for the bottom line nreceiving summer grant to study chemoelectric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses nhis main argument is that this is what the public wants they do nt want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science nthat he is depicted as monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins nthe third view in all this is the artists represented by lillian who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why should nt the same be true of the scientist nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored ngeoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the companys higher ups to argue his case but decides he ca nt wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his coworkers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area nin the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything nthe scientists engage in rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with davids view but coming at it from much different angle nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies nthat the directors point of view is absolutely right is beside the point nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters ngeoffrey was likened to hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty nalex has been spending lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alexs apartment ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to davids loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of phone conversation with one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way nwhat is progress nwhat can one expect out of life nis the small farmer about to become extinct nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in peaceful way nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white nno telling said lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic nthere is something about listening to lecture that turns off the rebel in me as do nt like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically nthat is not to say that found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picassos guernica had for him nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on nthe pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of husband all in the name of science had raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science nperhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art

bin the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon nin other words its decent couple of hours of entertainment but years from now if they compile list of mel gibsons greatest hits payback probably wo nt be on it ngibson plays crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist payroll nmels partner needed the money to pay off mob debt nso he puts couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on to pay off his creditors nbut mel is nt dead it would be real short movie if he was and he certainly is nt happy nto make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob to get it back npayback is often very violent film nto its credit there are few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director not sure which one more about that in second made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films nthe film appears bit disjointed in places which is understandable considering producer star gibson was nt thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it reshot nwhen the director refused another one was brought in to do the reshoot nso as result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally would love to see the original version for comparisons sake it does get bit of choppy feel to it towards the end nits always tough to make film where the main character is villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities nin this case gibsons character has few redeeming qualities nbut hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive ngibson is gibson whether he is playing suicidal cop or stone cold killer he does good job nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance nthis time out mel is surrounded by good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses nthe man who steals the show and unfortunately does nt have real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster nif had one big disappointment in this film it would be that coburn did nt have bigger role nin the end payback is fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibsons other work

bmelvin van peebles sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song was watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement nit was released less than decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before nin style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter nvan peebles black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself nbecause no studio would dare fund such film he was forced to raise all the money himself nthe movie ended up costing about part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby nvan peebles cut costs by hiring nonunion labor and taking on most of the films responsibilities himself nhe wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role nhe was also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way to make an extra buck nfor instance when the mppa slapped the film with dreaded xrating van peebles not only threatened to bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated by an allwhite jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film nhe also printed the phrase on teeshirts which he had no problem selling nthe storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple nit takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character tough male hustler of few words who grew up in brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex none day he agrees to go with couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on politicallycharged case involving murder nhowever on the way to the station the cops arrest young black revolutionary named mumu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of the ghettos alleys and backstreet whorehouses that other films had always overlooked nvan peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored nat the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is traditional prologue used in medieval times when messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but hymn from the mouth of reality nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration nof course with todays abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black innercity life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback does nt seem all that revolutionary nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made nat that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it ndistributors were petrified of film that in van peebles words gave the black audience chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass nof course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft and the mack because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers nhowever even if when viewed from an africanamerican perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies nwhen it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives nstill others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in scene where he gains the respect of white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nnevertheless movie like sweet sweetback can not be made without conflicting points of view nit is revolutionary movie not because its about one mans defiance but because it put frontandcenter black issues that had never been dealt with before nuntil that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites nthe fact that sweet sweetback was movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it nwhen the movie first opened he saw it in theater next to an older woman nnear the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die ndont let them kill him nlet him die on his own nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any africanamerican in movie who rebelled against white authority that she could nt even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape nand of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues nbeyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time nhe shot in rough documentarylike fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment nwatching sweet sweetback more than twentyfive years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect nthe legacy of sweet sweetbacks baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the africanamerican perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him
bthe first species was moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects few well paced action sequences and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing nhowever it was definitely not movie that cried out for sequel nand considering the quality of species its obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead nthe only thing that distinguishes species is how awful it is nif you throw away the plot which is characterized by blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species actually has few things to recommend it to select audience nof course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory should nt be able to get into an rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies ntheres enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species to prevent it from ever becoming boring nthis is grade exploitation flick that ripe for the mystery science theater treatment nsomewhere someplace recall hearing species described as erotic ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has peculiar notion of eroticism nsure there lot of sex and nudity but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions nanyone turned on by that is not someone would care to be sitting next to in theater ni suppose the main attraction in species is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone nthis creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile nmeanwhile man has finally set foot on mars na team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the red planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them nross has become halfhumanhalfalien hybrid and he soon mating like crazy collecting the bloodsoaked children that are the result of each sex session nhis intention is obviously world domination nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patricks fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson nbut when patrick learns about eve female of his kind there no damping his ardor nim not sure what the budget for species was but significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run nditto for james cromwell who plays patricks father underused is too kind word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it ngeorge dzundza gets to do little scenery chewing as an angrybutinept general nmeanwhile justin lazards performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridges limited abilities look good by comparison nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick ncomplete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics ndirector peter medak journeyman film maker with significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even scintilla of seriousness ndo recommend the movie nabsolutely not but will admit that species is dopey enough that it did nt try my patience to the degree that some pseudointellectual bad movies do nheres hoping there no species
bi remember really enjoying this movie when saw it years ago ni guess my memory really sucks nthere is very very little that is funny in caddyshack nthe laughs are few and far between and what there are really are nt that great ncaddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club nmichael okeefe plays said caddy nwhy they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me nthe movie does nt seem to have real plot just series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera nthe only real story if you can call it that was subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against gopher who is ruining the course nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success nbill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase who did nt even crack smile on my face with his characters lame zenlike approach to golfing nthere are few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie ni guess that what you get for basing story around an unknown kid nim not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper nnothing about this movie works nit would nt have taken genius to figure out that this thing was nt going to fly nmost of the scenes just could nt possibly be funny nits as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world nim sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny nin reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch nthere is scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny nbut for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack

bthere are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original none of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one nits popularity can be measured not in multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day ncasablanca is also movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail at least judging by conventional moviemaking wisdom of its time nit was based on broadway play so mediocre that it had nt been produced on stage screenplay by three writers julius epstein philip epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered to be capable but not great director nhowever the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film nuntil this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story nin december casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazicollaborating french vichy government nthousands of refugees from wartorn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas nmany shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains nhis best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic antifascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody nhowever everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca none of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris nthe couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail nrick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride selfpreserving interest and his own hatred of fascism nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status nbogarts portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen did nt look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works nfor many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made nbut the reason for that is nt the romance itself its the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choices in their life nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in case of main leads nthe supporting actors also did marvellous job nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give mystic flavour spotted in previous bogart classic john hustons maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny nunfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rickilsa coupling nhowever rick and ilsa actually have serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca ncaptain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in role of lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary nrains also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renaults relationship towards rick and ricks final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations ntogether with welldrawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere nprofessional nitpickers would probably have field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still shining example of hollywood ww movie that is beliavable if not realistic nany way even if we do nt see it as historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration
bthe smallscale film in limited release waking ned devine is pleasant excursion to time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of small town nfilled with breathtaking scenery characters and delightful music the movie would be interesting even without plot nthe story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in review nthe film starts out with sharp opening which gives us taste of what is to follow country folk with an inclination for bit of larceny nwhat gets things going is the fact that winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town pop of tullymore nwho that person is and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ian bannen and michael david kelly npart detectives part scalawags they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds nthe village consists of several amusing characters na clueless pig farmer temporary priest and witch ntheres also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the upandup nthere are no hollywood touches to this film except for the outer space introduction npacing is right ntowards the end it runs bit out of steam but that okay because for most of the minutes we ve been interested in the goings on na mixture of laughs and occasional sentiment all the right emotions are engaged nin one brief dream sequence you ll know it when you see it fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to place you really hope exists none of the key moments in the film nthe music available on cd london follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering na fine film that for everybody except action fans nsomewhat like the englishman who went up hill and came down mountain nbut livelier

insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good nafter star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise ni do nt wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies nmost people reading this probably have nt followed star trek anyway so comparison would seem tedious at best nlet me thus make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie nokay lets move to the movie itself nstar trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanitys exploration and colonization of space with lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners nthis combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times nstar trek insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld nforget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show nthis

side of his nose as result of his exposure to the baku homeworld pimple which his crewmates try as they might can not avoid looking at nthe acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good nsince they ve been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers moral speech picards trademark with his usual aplomb nbrent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good

baron harkonnen in the film version of dune nlike the baron ruafro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servants nin one particularly memorable scene ruafro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds nruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations okay promise no more comparisons ndonna murphy must also be noted as baku woman anij who picard falls in love with nmurphy is not young woman with supermodel body she is mature woman with an attractive countenance nthis is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with nin fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here na particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down an ability which she shares with picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie nfor as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing nthey proved adequate sometimes barely for mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on completely unconvincing interior of satellite nthe new enterprise itself only seen in this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior does nt look quite right for reason can not explain ndespite star trek insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects enjoyed the film nit maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though do nt get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully nid recommend insurrection as matinee film for saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general nrated pg ca nt see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old

btheres only one presidential election every four years but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year nin we ve had absolute power air force one shadow conspiracy and murder at nthis one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford trying to bring us complex plot of coverup and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys nheres what happens this time nits night at the white house na secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with cute butt nthe next day she dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in nhow do we know he hotshot nweve seen the traditional action flick opener the clever hostage negotiation scene nits not so clever this time consisting of snipes disarming suicidal exgovernment employee holding gun to his head in the middle of the street nsnipes is off to the white house where he finds the secret service head the shiny bald head of daniel benzali wo nt cooperate with him at all nin fact if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda snipes would nt have been allowed in the white house at all nalda helps snipes out further assigning sexy secret service agent diane lane to act as his liaison na very dangerous liaison nwell not really just wanted to say that nalmost immediately suspect is found an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos nsnipes does nt buy it and launches into an independent investigation of his own one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the presidents son nsnipes partner an always wisecracking dennis miller calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane who at first does nt believe snipes eventually and predictably comes around and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information nfor the first hour or so murder at looks like it could be going somewhere interesting nsure we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon nsnipes and lane do nt make for bad action team but with nothing to work with they re just cogs in the bad movie machine ndennis miller might as well not even be in the movie they waste his talents more in murder at than they did in bordello of blood and that saying lot nwhen you get to the last halfhour the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into wet sewer busting out the old breakintothebuilding underground climax nand when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why you ll wish you never sat through this movie at all nthe in the movies title does nt represent an address it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide nserving the world for nearly th of century
bseen september at at rotterdam square mall cinema theater with chris wessell for free using my sonyloews critics pass ntheater rating good seats average sound picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents do nt want their kids to see nits not that its drunken orgy of sex and violence but because its film that flatout says you can make career out of gambling nand to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott something law student in presentday new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played ndamon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voicedover so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting nmikes about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich russian gangster who looks like serial killer nbut then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally ndamon in the flesh might seem little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features but his narration is what brings it all together nhe never sounds like he reading from script nor that he trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite nimmediately we get the sense that poker is nt for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel nthe game is quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble bit nwe learn only little about mike both past and present npresently we know he has girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling nthey go through few breakupmakeup cycles until mikes childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison nits not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such predictable element and execute it the way it does ntechnically the plot is nt unlike many childrens sitcoms in which the good kids bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid nwhat this film does is use different medium to tell that story nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share passion for outthinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he dealt and works with them nsometimes they pay off nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they do nt nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works steady job after dropping on single hand nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all neverything they come into contact with is big poker game in that everythings battle against the cards destiny deals none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by judge martin landou in perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time nmatts good at gambling but he also got potential to be great lawyer nhe could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there stability but not much risk involved ncan someone who gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave nif the film had been just subtle lesson in pokerplaying then the ending is our test neverything is told from mikes perspective but were finally able to recognize some things on our own nthis makes the final againstall odds showdown seem like just that nit works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof nwhat separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end
bthe saint was actually little better than expected it to be in some ways nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes living by stealing things from others for others nthis movie closely resembles james bond flick nit has the classic bond symbols man who can do just about anything and get away with it woman whom the man persues villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal nkilmer actually provides rather good role in this movie although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations nthe movie begins in his childhood in strict school run by catholic priests nas young boy kilmers character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name that of catholic saint nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be nthis leads to devestating mistake which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life nkilmers first mission that we are shown is to steal microchip from ivan tretiak played by rade serbedzija nduring press conference he must make his way into heavily guarded vault area avoiding guards cameras and many other potential obstacles nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home the fee is paid nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only few million dollars short of million he decides to carry out only one more mission then retire ndr emma russell portrayed by elisabeth shue has discovered way to produce energy by way of cold fusion nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia where millions are without heat and are freezing to death nthe only problem is tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal ntretiak hires him to steal the equations small pieces of paper from shue none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions nthey are very convincing not only to the characters in the movie but to us nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shues character into getting to know him even more which would provide him means of stealing the energy formula nwhen the two meet and end up having sensual experience kilmers character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell as she is falling in love with kilmers alterego traveling artist nyet he must reach his goal of million which requires him to steal the energy formula putting his feelings aside nshues character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces the names of the catholic saints together something no one else is able to do nwhen she finds him they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak nthe saint is very actionpacked with few slow points nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments nalong the course of the movie there are even few although brief moments of comedy nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmers extraneous very convincing disguises and personalities nall in all rather enjoyable movie with nearly nonstop action

bwhenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films the end result is always mess of script acting directing and generally waste of time for any audience with an average iq above nthe latest movie morass from hollywood the crew appeared equally destined to fail strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship nthe scary thing is that its actually entertaining and breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month nthe crew works for several reasons nthe clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie following four past their prime wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach nthe wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their golden paradise by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property nthe four mobsters bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel decide to hatch scheme to plant there dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home nthis simple plan suddenly goes screwy of course and the boys become involved with stripper named ferris jennifer tilly who wants her stepmother killed paranoid latin drug lord who convinced mysterious rival is out to get him and rat with its tail on fire nthe crew works as strong comedic vehicle driven by great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men ninstead of concentrating on bobbys search for his daughter the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys balancing the production nthe acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya seymour cassel and the great great burt reynolds are brought out by each characters uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle na strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as philandering boyfriendcoppartner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs nthe film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner emmy awardwinning director of the wonder years nthe quick script written by barry fanaro screenwriter of kingpin is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit nthe crew is prime example of how simple and drywitted comedy can get these days nthe great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids phallus symbols in the head or grandmothers giving head in spa nin the steady flow of extreme comedy these days flowing from hollywood like broken water main its the elder statesmen like dreyfuss reynolds and hedaya that can carry comic arc with only few weapons of choice decent script and good acting
btrue faith and its expression through organized religion is difficult subject for motion picture to tackle headon which is probably why so few of them do it neven the most religious directors like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms nso its not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get the apostle onto the bigscreen nas matter of fact even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing and he ended up paying for it with million of his own money nhe also wrote the script directed the film and starred as the central character fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial technical and creative responsibility singlehandedly and its testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall nand thankfully every bit of that personal investment translates onscreen into power and honest emotion nsonny is an energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since he was twelve nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers sonny is not phony or swindler and the films purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says although like all humans he has weaknesses none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that not only does his longsuffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want to leave him for another man in the congregation but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into violent temper nat his sons baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wifes lover in the face with baseball bat inflicting wound that may be fatal nnot knowing what else to do sonny disappears nhe throws away his identification drives his car into lake and takes bus to louisiana hoping to start over again nin the tiny mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling nafter befriending simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the towns exminister john beasley sonny sets up his own church the one way to heaven temple nrechristening himself as the apostle he quickly draws together an eager congregation and together they realize real change in each others lives nbut always sonnys past is lurking step behind him waiting to swallow his progress nduvall has made his intentions in making the apostle clear nin recent article in newsweek he wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such strong emphasis on the holy spirit and when they do it tends to be patronizing full of charlatans and snake handlers nbut what really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe and to portray it in an accurate way nthe strength of duvalls convictions turn out to be the strength of his film the apostle always rings true even in the most painful moments because we know he being sincere with the subject matter nafter fifteen years of traveling the country listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual nhis sonny is man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to ve always called you jesus and you ve always called me sonny he says nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs sonnys mother june carter cash just hangs up on them because she knows there no sense trying to interrupt him nthe main theme to emerge from the apostle is the fact that good can come from any situation nsonnys act of violence toward another human being is inarguably horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact nhowever that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him nin his short time in louisiana he does world of good and when the police finally show up to take him away he goes quietly knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him nand as scene during the final credits shows he even turns his punishment into positive opportunity for change and betterment nit is that strength in sonnys character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others he is flawed but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves nwatching duvall onscreen its not hard to imagine that he would have been magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting nas sonny he completely inhabits the character and his performance is certainly the best of the year nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities of real preachers duvall was able to create complete character who always feels indelibly human nas director duvall feels that less is more nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it with very little intrusion nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups nduvall knew that the power of the films characters enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers did nt need to be artificially enhanced nin this way the apostle almost plays out like documentary not only in its technical simplicity but more importantly in its sense of reality
bone of the sweetest tales to ever be made its wonderful life is nt perfect but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results nprobably the greatest feelgood film of all time its wonderful life aims for the heart and strikes with golden arrow non christmas eve george bailey stewart is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls nyou see george is in trouble and he has always helped others who needed it nthis one time however god answers his prayers and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence travers to try and save george nclarence has got his own problems however nclarence is an angel without his wings and each time the bell rings the wings pass him by nthe bailey case is way for him to earn those magical wings and become true angel nbut before clarence can save george he first has to go through cliffs notes version of george baileys life nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brothers life sacrificing his college education to save the family business sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank is nt sold to the evil mr potter barrymore who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls none christmas potter gets his chance nuncle billy bailey mitchell loses of the banks money nwithout the money the bank must close down ngeorge is stuck in tremendous bind and contemplates suicide nclarence the faithful servant is there just to pick him up and to show him what bedford would be like without george nthis is all leadin to the very famous last scene where george finally sees what true happiness is about nits wonderful life does have its faults nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details especially in the treatment of women and men nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the like something out of revisionist look nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film nthere are however endearing moments in all of this ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the to make the movie remarkably enjoyable nthe story is hackneyed and the ending feels well little too sugarish ntheres this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything especially the sequences where george is either in trouble or helping somebody nits little too nice for my liking at times nthere is however enough humor enough wit and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part which would be the most difficult nbut watching its wonderful life is never boring or difficult its always interesting right until the finale which for all its sugar makes delightful sense and is beautifully done ncapra does have his monumental cliches but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection ndonna reed is perfect as the loving obeidient wife and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr potter neveryone else is magnificent including bert and ernie ward bond and frank faylen nthere is general sense of goodness as if everyone in the film knows that they are making great film and they relish that nstewart however is the king of all of this nhe is sometimes awkward especially when saying merry christmas to all objects animate or inanimate nbut he is james stewart and he lovably delightful throughout the film nhave complained ni should nt have nthis is really good movie nno this is great movie nbetter yet this is phenomenal movie nthere is reason classics are invented to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life nthis is one of those films nit is feelgood movie something people complain little too much about nbut capras reworking of christmas carol is the greatest christmas movie of all time nthere ve said it ni have to admit the first time saw this saw it with my family including my year old kid sister nthey all loved it nthey loved george his wife his troubles and the beautiful ending nis it little too sugarcoated nmaybe nno matter nthis is film that should be watched time and time again with families around coffee table and eggnog on the plate nit is film that just makes you feel good about life family and hope nit is the perfect christmas film flaws and all nit is frank capras greatest acheivement and that really does say lot nfor about out of minutes this movie is flawless nthe rest can be excused no film is perfectly flawless ni ca nt get over how much love this movie and how much you will after watching it digesting it and sitting with your family appreciating how special life really is

battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year nit has to be nthe other prospect is just too horrifying to consider nbad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed train wreck in both critical and popular circles felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand nis it as bad as advertised noh yes very much so nthe plot is incomprehensible nthe acting is atrocious nthe special effects are mediocre nthe action is dull nthe implausibilities are legion nthe dialogue is cringeinducing nthe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny ni do nt even want to continue reviewing this movie like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is nthe premise is basically ripoff of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo nthe year is the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved nonly handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear none man johnny goodboy know know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos nthere he confronts the psychlo head of security big ugly klingonlooking creature called terl john travolta npressed into slavery johnny vows to lead revolution and take the planet back nmeanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that he stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter nhe decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous nso the mananimal can lead mining expedition into places the psychlos ca nt go nterl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself nof course his plan does nt work nso many things wrong with this movie where to begin nhow about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru ron hubbards scifi novel nearly previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo nof course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally do nt laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees you were going to be promoted but now you re not nfwahahahahahahahaha nits no big surprise terl loses to the humans he an idiot nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book nhe underestimates his enemies assuming hell win just because he smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me nhe then appears shocked that johnny points gun at him nno wonder this guy never got his promotion nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive nhow come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open nhow in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in hangar for years nand how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ntheres whole lot more to scratch ones head about in battlefield earth nbring scorecard to track the plot holes ndirector roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason nall the characters appear to be standing on the walls and its awfully difficult to watch movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue nthe action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement nare these things really so hard to construct nmy respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot nthis movie is an absolute headache nits not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense nfor most of battlefield earths running time just did nt know what was happening nit did nt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are really had no idea what the hell was going on nwhen pieced the plot together later it did nt look any better nheres how much of disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and its going to take something really really inept to top it nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it nin fact think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible nthatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again

bthis movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name nbefore this film the game had few spinoff cartoons which were ok nbut the idea of doing movie is insane nit should have been animated if it should have been done at all ninstead the people do the best they can with talented cast nyet it still fails nthe plot is completely different from the games plot not complaining about that nthe story involves the mario bros having plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with rival company neventually they find construction site by their nemesis which happens to be enviromentally unsafe nso due to luigis john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy they go and investigate nthey get transported to blade runneresque world lead by king koopa dennis hopper nsomehow plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic megacity jumbles in nthe plot is fine better than the movie deserves nthe acting is ok nthis seems to be more of visual film nthe special effects are good especially on the robotic yoshi nhowever the film drags and is no fun nand it leaves itself open to sequel which probably wo nt ever be made nthis movie begins sort of promising but ends up leaving weird taste in your mouth nso if you want to watch sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper then watch super mario bros nthe movie nyou could do worse nbut you could definitely do better nstreet fighter the movie starring raul julia and jean claude vandamme nthis movie was based off of series of never ending sequels to game called street fighter it has all the characters from the game in reasonable plot nit is more like movie than it should be nyes its watchable nraul julia does good job considering this was his final film nwhile the game had nonstop fighting sequences this movie is hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off plot at the same time ndoes it work nsort of nthe plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by bison raul julia nguile jean claude vandamme takes his troops to attack bisons main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over nin short amount of time the movie introduces several characters well nit catches your attention nbut it ultimately seems like showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like there chun li nor look at that fireball ryu did at vega nit hits the bases by presenting the characters in plot with good sets but goes no further nthis movie needed more action in the first place nthe action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting nif you like lighthearted action flicks or if you liked the game watch this one nit is even worth watching if you want to see raul julias last performance or if you ca nt get enough of van damme nother than that you could find better action flicks
bive always been kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances nthe minute saw the trailer for this film resolved to see it nbesides the fact that kline starred it looked like hilarious film ni got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as also thought wow if there this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be ton of laughs in the rest of the film oops packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multimultiplex nthe film began nthe film concerns an englishdrama teacher at suburban high school named howard brackett nhe loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon put in his name but my wife wo nt let me take notes during movie and ve forgotten it nthey continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him nbrackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her nthe wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is homosexual nkline spends most of the first twothirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he is nt nthe whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference nhis closest friends do nt help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party nthere are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity nkline is hounded by gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations nthe movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding nkline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows nif you want to be surprised do nt read am going to reveal the ending instead of saying do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says gay nthis is where the movie in my opinion falls apart nmost of the humor in the film had come from klines insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy nit reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live nit was funny it was sustainably funny and klines performance made it doubly so nhowever after the wedding the film drags on nthey should have attempted to come to quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he done nhe reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him nthere are several scenes which seemed like waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless nfinally even though am not catholic found the scene with the priest to be condescending nthe preist can not believe that man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person he gay nit got chuckle from the audience but was distracted by it and began to tire of the film nby the time the wedding had come and gone found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying noverall if have to quantify it say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets nsee it in economy time

bplot two teen couples go to church party drink and then drive nthey get into an accident none of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares nwhats the deal nwatch the movie and sorta find out ncritique mindfuck movie for the teen generation that touches on very cool idea but presents it in very bad package nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write since generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just did nt snag this one correctly nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly nso what are the problems with the movie nwell its main problem is that its simply too jumbled nit starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea what going on nthere are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained nnow personally do nt mind trying to unravel film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again get kind of fed up after while which is this films biggest problem nits obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes nand do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime nnot really nthe sad part is that the arrow and both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make little bit of sense but it still did nt the make the film all that more entertaining ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding ni mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy nokay we get it there nare people chasing her and we do nt know who they are ndo we really need to see it over and over again nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie napparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows nthere might ve been pretty decent teen mindfuck movie in here somewhere but guess the suits decided that turning it into music video with little edge would make more sense nthe actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in new neighborhood nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her characters unraveling noverall the film does nt stick because it does nt entertain its confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it noh and by the way this is not horror or teen slasher flick its njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since nwhatever skip nit nwheres joblo coming from na nightmare of elm street blair witch the crow the crow salvation lost highway memento the others stir of echoes
psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred na blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate ripoff nbut no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argentos most consistently successful film nwhat impresses most in rewatching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argentos directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by nearfully coherent narrative nscreenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions nno question argento has always been better director than writer nfortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis nthe films storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of ballet school being front for coven of witches njessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance narriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees girl leave and run into the storm in clearly distressed state nwhat happens next and do nt make the comparison lightly is murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene in psycho nits quite possibly homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argentos own nthough nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspirias opening minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school nwe meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles she does so well nseveral more violent murders ensue including startling scene in deserted square where blind man is well would nt want to spoil things now would and the films climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has gothic ghoulishness that most impressive nthe english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about nfortunately the cuts to suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film nthe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with conversation between harper and professor about the history of witchcraft in the region nand the soundtrack nit is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else nas it stands the use of goblins music in suspiria is outstanding napparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts na stereo video player adds greatly to the viewers overall experience neven better see suspiria in cinema where you ll get the added bonus of widescreen nand the colours ndeep reds eerie blues superb use of shadow and contrast nthe cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb na nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors nthese kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argentos more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on which bassan also worked nsuspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status nthe gore is at times little excessive and overstated that always been one of argentos shortcomings but overall this is fascinating compelling example of italian horror
bthe haunting film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of horror film to scare us nif you ve ever seen movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before movie nthey have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film nbut the one always like are the quot other namequot joke that try and rename particular film nfor instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers nthey had titles like little infantry and can get those fatigues in smaller size nwell after seeing the haunting had few particular names for it as well nunfortunately can only post one of them otherwise be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers nthat title would be the confusing nok that is pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly nit basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for cinematic bomb nliam neeson once again gets wrapped up in film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth nthe haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make boatload of money nbefore rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and stress the word few bright spots in this film nfirst the house is great looking nit looks beautiful but this is also dark spot nit looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it nthis is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film nthings look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight nhaunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie nthe hill house is not eerie nit is beautiful but not the least bit frightening never heard of lili taylor nbefore this film did not but am glad that do now nshe gives the only satisfactory performance in the film ndespite the dry dialogue and boringconfusing concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her costars are usually following right behind nowen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor nhe is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas nall of the characters are desperately underdeveloped nwilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add few laughs nliam neeson and catherine zetajones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film ntheir characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot nthey just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin nthe plot is terrible nthe opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting closeups of all the things that will play major role in the end of the film nas sat through the film kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish nnell lili taylors character goes from the hunted to the savior nit makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film nhe forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information nfor instance the beginning of the film gives us sense of why nell is getting involved in the program nbut we get zilch for the other four nplus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes nand the worst part most horror films have killings nfor some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film nno reason whatsoever just off with his head literally noverall the haunting is the epitome of bad movie nbad plot confusing storyline and waste of good talent nhopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into good film and be used to his full potential nhopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such great job in such bad film nand hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one

barnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse nits hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got million what it matter to him nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that ca nt compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser nin this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate woman robin tunney which happens every years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself nwith the help of trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world nparts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma nyes the film is that weak but its better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like star film nanyway this definitely does nt seem like an arnold movie nit just was nt the type of film you can see him doing nsure he gave us few chuckles with his well known oneliners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going nits understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources naside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films nim sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days nspeaking of action where was it in this film nthere was hardly any explosions or fights nthe devil made few places explode but arnold was nt kicking some devil butt nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film ni was at least hoping for cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again was let down ni also do nt know why the film took so long and cost so much nthere was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget nthe budget should have gone into better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom nits pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into movie ndo they even read these things anymore nit sure does nt seem like it nthankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you ca nt help but feel that he looked like devil nthe guy is creepy looking anyway nwhen its all over you re just glad its the end of the movie ndont bother to see this if you re expecting solid action flick because its neither solid nor does it have action nits just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to strategic marketing campaign nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience
bi admit it ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies nwatching him in jingle all the way wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such lame movie targeted at susceptible kids nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation nand you know they ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santas elves nhe later decks reindeer nhey man why do nt you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you re at it njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought narnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene nwhat can you expect from movie whose entire premise is that two parents ca nt find rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one narnold is of course one of the parents crack salesman who is never there for his son nhe races from the office to his sons karate game only to find out he missed it nand his kid distrusts him because he never around gee we have nt seen that in movie before narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his sons affection is to get him turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago nso arnold sets out to find turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out nlet me back up for minute here arnolds kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief nwatches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets nid try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think its wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want nbut nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who do nt recognize him until the last minute nthis is sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through store racing off to the mall and hooking up with santa jim belushi who runs bootleg toy factory nmost painful to watch is scene at radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away turboman doll ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible its the main plot of the movie that sends the message that its okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want nmaybe that what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nat the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for gala premiere nthis highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture nand with good reason nthis is joyless exercise of film held together by barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last years case study in style over substance joel schumachers muchloathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes numa thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad karatechopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage nunfortunately the same ca nt be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board sinking ship nat this rate usuallysplendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days nthe duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spoton english accent nif nothing else it at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt nthe story such as it is involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climatecontrolling contraption they also sip lot of tea noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds nthe avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac its all decidedly uncompelling nmr connery who onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest nat least it all looks good nthis is genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt nin particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain nthere are handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by swarm of giant robotic bees and nice shot of steed and peel finding way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates nby the time the films climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre nnot coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year nits everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining na crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but sure hope not

bi know that funnest is nt word fun is noun and therefore can not be conjugated like an adjective nbut that the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run nno wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ve ever seen nso to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ve seen in while ni ca nt remember the last time ve seen anything funner nthe chickens at tweedys farm are up to something nliving in concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for pieselling plan nshe orders huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out nwhat sort of pies nchicken pies of course ncodirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures npart of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories nbut in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with codirector peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement nthing is the film does nt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisonersofwar movie starring chickens npark and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut they re chickens so its funny to us nanother thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing nthere are references to the great escape obviously and stalag nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom ntheres even nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution nconsider this since july of last year ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run does nt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene nif you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie does nt require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it nshe has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gungho veneer nthe characters inevitable romance does nt feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly is nt any help njane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens nthe animation is firstrate nremember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail nas in such topnotch family fare as bugs life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details nanyway the movies just boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ve seen all year

bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned non december amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences by finally presenting set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given boost nscream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new lines nightmare on elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight nand screams rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion nits hard to understate this last point nmr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream know what you did last summer from october and now scream enjoyed meteoric rise to fame quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading box office figurewatching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as director nindeed in singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional film by wes craven drapes the films title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written by kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of film by is attained nand much like mr tarantinos screenwriting mr williamsons work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters nin scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels nscream was written in during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and mr williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset treatment of scream was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging nlike its predecessor scream opens with splashy eyegrabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative this time around were following the exploits of young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab running filmwithinafilm gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into movie nhowever although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one was sharing the theatre with and was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in horror film that ve ever seen nthere are too many knowing hip popculture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup is nt nearly as cleverly frightening as screams while the first films preface dizzyingly built up to final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical nflash to the campus of smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town to cover the breaking story while everawkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in to protectively guard over sidney ntheyre joined by cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in cameo appearance during the first film his role here is significantly expanded nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although suppose good case can be made that it really is nt necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all sequel to slasher film what do you think happened to these characters in the prior movie ntheres lot of new faces on the scene too sidneys new boyfriend derek jerry oconnell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randys fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf coed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi nany of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim nas is seemingly becoming regular staple of kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of whodunit none problem that scream did nt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer nhere and to some extent in know what you did last summer mr williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into mystery nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements it does nt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo nindeed the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived the aspect where its headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences ntheyre staged much more imaginatively here save for the first postprologue murder which is handled in such mediocre conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun to watch nits hard to hold back smile during giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from car wreck and catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown nin terms of its characters the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten and there curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed non the other hand sidney is pretty dull here nshe does nt have any compelling presence and there nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she the returning heroine ngiven this and the fact that there no strong second banana character for sidney elise neals role is nt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film nwhat surprises me the most about scream is its zealousness in decimating its cast nthe films mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal applaud this bold policy at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious nbut hey as rose mcgowans character said in the first film no please do nt kill me mr ghostface want to be in the sequel nlook what that got her

bim giving this stinker nnormally the worst that would ever rate movie would be nbut the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg nim not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all nmaybe in mels little mind horse being knocked unconscious because of punch to the face is funny nin mine its not nor maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking nbecause only the selfrighteous lee uses the nword more often in his films than brooks did in this one nat least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing nbrooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it nwrong mel ni would call you boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere nthis idiotic attempt at comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors harvey korman attempts to clear out town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad nhe sends his goons to run the townsfolk out nbut the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them new sheriff to protect them nthe governor pawns the task off to kormans character hedley lamarr can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name nlamarr decides to send the town black sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of black man living among them that they will all just leave nhold on ve got to stop while these gales of laughter pass nits just too funny nracism passing as humor gosh why did nt anybody ever think of that one before noh wait think somebody might have they are called the kkk nim not calling brooks racist but am calling him an insensitive bastard who would nt know what was funny if it hit him over the head nbut digress nanyway the black sheriff rides into town amid flurry of townsfolk using the nword ngolly will the hilarity just never end nhe ends up joining forces with drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west ntogether they save the day from evil nnot one person in this movie gives decent performance nwilder looks like he is recovering from head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be part of the movie nok he really did nt but he should have nthe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day ni did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience ni admit to starting to snicker on couple of occasions nactually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie ni can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever nmel brooks would be doing the world favor if he burned every last copy of this film
bi have no real tangible proof of this but swear that there are lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take bad script written by bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make good movie nusing their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into good movie is cast bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget nthis is the only way can fathom how th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre nnow before continue to ferociously attack what wrong with this film just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller ncatherine zetajones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery nif you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before really do nt have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes nthe problem we come to is that we ve all seen this few billion times before and this film does nt break any new ground in the bigbudgethollywoodaction genre nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived nim going to be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones nnow while this may be compliment for ms zetajones it certainly is nt for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail nwith an eighty million dollar budget you think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx nwell you be wrong nthe action that is present in this film takes place in huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by years nthe reality is that after minutes of watching this picture you know exactly what going to happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists nmany scenes seem to exist merely as reason to outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laserbeams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask nnothing wrong with that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why did nt she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room nill tell you why because its great excuse to photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zetajones and the most interesting character in the film not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss concept invented just to describe this picture none last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into shadow or behind building or he becomes obstructed by moving vehicle and then in the next shot hell spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking to himself it ll leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that nwe know jon its called editing
bthe best thing about lake placid is that its only minutes long and when its over you re glad that you did nt waste more than an hour and half of your time nits nothing more than bad ripoff of jaws and think that being kind nit was written by david kelly ally mcbeal as horrorcomedy but fails at both miserably ni was never scared and think that only laughed once nthe crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda nthe plot begins when man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine nthat brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and fishandgame warden bill pulman to investigate nalso paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast nsoon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it ntheres also an eccentric old lady betty white who lives by the lake and has few secrets nas mentioned before kelley and director steve minor do nt go for serious approach towards the material but they also do nt have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either nthe betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting they re all basically idiots nif they had any brains the croc would nt have been that much of challenge to catch and they would nt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did nbut then again if they were smart there would nt be movie nbasically lake placid is best undiscovered

bas you should know this summer has been less than memorable nwith total of decent films its not surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing nwith that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on the th warrior will be nthe film is based on the michael crichton eaters of the dead in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at wife of king nafter tarveling for many months he comes across gang of norsemen who are forced to pick men to protect town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog nso they start picking men and are left without thus ahmed is choosen nso far it sounds interesting right nnot when all of this takes place in minutes nafter that they basically run around killing nthat alone shows how much script is needed for film because once your story is introduced you have the rest of the film to start developing it nobviously that not the case here neven if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure you will be disappointed nsince all the action takes place in fog it is constantly hard to see scene clearly due to those circumstances and to poor camera work ncant the camera men sit still nid like to actually watch film in focus but again they failed to deliver that as well nthe film moves on and on until the point where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you re eating nwith corny dialogue that the characters laugh at for some odd reason script that goes nowhere dull action sequences predictable ending and worst of all weak characters there basically nothing to like here except for maybe the set designs nthats the only thing that honestly caught my interest nwhen heard that john mctiernan the director wanted his name kept out of the project that made me wonder why nwell now know ncrichtons greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product which led to big arguement nwhats there to argue about anyway nthe film could nt be saved no matter how much they spent or casted nseeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money would nt be surprised to see the th warrior become hit nplease do me favor and save your money at all costs or else you will be lost in the fog like the film itself
bthe heartbreak kid reviewed on aug th nstarring charles grodin cybill sheppard eddie albert nin the heartbreak kid charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters ve seen on screen in long time nhes guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another ni doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film nas the film opens he has just gotten married and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon nhalfway there he begins to resent his bride nby the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character he is ready to divorce his wife nas played by grodin this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him nthe phrase the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence was practically written with him in mind nhowever if he finds something he really wants he will pursue it for as long as it takes nthe only problem is once he has it he immediately loses interest nthe end of the heartbreak kid is both hilarious and sad for that very reason ncharles grodin is at his smarmy best here and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodins desire nhowever the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin daughter of director elaine may as grodins whiny bride nshe owns every scene that she in and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do the heartbreak kid was written by neil simon and it shows nsimon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships and he at the top of his game here nas maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is he the type of guy that everyone knows nthe character of george costanza on seinfeld seems to have been modelled after him nthe only problem with the film is that its not that funny and its billed as comedy nas much as could see the realism in the characters it would have been nice to have chuckle here and there the heartbreak kid is not date movie nit has an extremely negative view of relationships so seeing it with girlfriendboyfriend could be hazardus to your health

ba sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom nthere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny nthe film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays brazilian chef with magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who ca nt get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story npen lope was wonderful in pedro almod vars all about my mother but here she is so visible in such stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face nthe best you can say about her is that she not to blame for this picture being so off nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than raunchy film that delivers what it says it will nthe story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook nto cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure nshe is able to control it now as long as she does nt drive car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love nin other words she has to be in control of things nin her small fishing town she falls in love with handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him nthey open up successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though he loafer none night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco nwe do nt see her in flight so ca nt tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane nshe visits her friends apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is crossdresser blending right into the san francisco scene nto cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again nher luck changes when local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show nyou can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good nso he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again nhe brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window nhe sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him nwhen he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and he hired as regular on the show nthe show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national nbut they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because he freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to lowcut vanna white type of sexy dresses ncliff her wouldbe boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network bigshots even though he loved everything she did nthese tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting nit was an insult to ones intelligence nim sure that not spoiling the ending for anyone when tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up meal that breaks her spell of loving him again nif the film was nt terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers nit was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it nthis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it does nt look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like film that was interferred with from above nits more like futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven
bremember back in the mid when crime and macabre movies were all the rage pulp fiction and fargo both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection does nt look like anything comprehendable nits crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has claustrophobic atmosphere film that wo nt allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim nthat film had great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if its really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating nwith the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial shame because maybe that would have helped nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely reason to live but are nt hellbent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro nthey get lucky when they hear about scheme between bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have baby through in vitro fertilization nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get nice ransom nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he doing nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously ca nt call the authorities for help nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back nthe execs son is doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all nmcquarrie does nt know the meaning of the word simple nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making good movie neverything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that its to the point of surrealism nnothing is what it seems in this reality its one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industrys rules and regulations nevery scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and were hardly given clue as to what they re talking about nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they re more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash nno one here really acts like real person and the story is even further removed from reality nits like dream without any appeal ntake the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in parking lot across the street from bar or club counting their money and stuff nthey sit on brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they do nt move nthe guy and his loudmouth pottymouth girlfriend and about other people cross the street and gang up on them nyoud think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they do nt instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by mob ntheres lot of things did nt understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes is nt some yuppie or old rich snob he like hippie straight out of the nsecondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed nlastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than small countrys army nif they were suicidal they would nt have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either ntheres lot more could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable nand its all coated with thin layer of black comedy which is good for chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like desperate attempt to kill screen time nwith any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it ni ca nt say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and ca nt imagine anyone intelligently defending it
blife is beautiful is rare treat lighthearted comedy that tackles very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful or even worse humorless nit combines charming romance with dash of farce stirs in little poignancy and ends up very enjoyable movie nits an italian film but do nt let that discourage you nsubtitlephobes will be missing wonderful experience nlife is beautiful opens as sweet romantic comedy with the clownish but good natured guido roberto benigni arriving in rustic italian town to work as waiter for his uncle nthe year is and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams dora nicoletta braschi ntheir romance seems to be picture perfect with only one stumbling block she already engaged to another man ncan guido overcome the odds and win his girl nwhat do you think nhowever five years later things have taken turn for the worse in italy nthe fascists have stepped up their race initiatives which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue giorgio cantarini who are rounded up and shipped off to concentration camp nunable to protect his boy in any other way guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp nhe pretends that everything is all an elaborate game with points awarded for such tasks as hiding being brave and being very very quiet nas you can tell from the description life is beautiful has two very different tones but manages to excel at both of them nas romantic comedy it is sweet and funny nas bittersweet tale of hope amid despair it is touching nroberto benignis work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplins and it is easy to see why nhe is able to run the gamut of comic expression from slapstick to farce with warmhearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden heros triumph of the underdog spirit nlife is beautiful treads thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust nhowever it is able to successfully navigate the minefield without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears nwith life is beautiful benigni has created triumphant but bittersweet comedy nits quite simply one of the most enjoyable times ve had at the movies this year
bdavid spade has snide sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me nit also served as good showcase for him when he costarred opposite the late chris farley in tommy boy and black sheep nlost and found marks the comedians first attempt at going solo in movie and it also reveals that when spade does nt have reliable backup system his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect ndavid spade is not the problem with lost and found nhe plays dylan ramsey the sweet main character to the best of his abilities nthe story revolves around dylans obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour lila dubois sophie marceau from braveheart and her terrier named jack ndylan believes that the best way to womans heart is through her dog nand so he kidnaps jack planning to stage fake rescue in hope to win lila over nthere are three good things about lost and found nthe first is spade nthe second is sophie marceau lovely actress who been planted into the wrong movie nlastly there the dog who is used here in similar context to puffy from there something about mary nunfortunately director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute nthis kind of physical humor is dead npollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with baseball bat to get laughs and this procedure is cheap unfunny and resoundingly cruel nthis is where start to get fuzzy nalso in this unusual blend is apparently sweetnatured love story between dylan and lila ngiven the meanspirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for found this hard to swallow nand why does dylan even deserve someone like lila after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain npredictably lost and found opts for happy ending one that feels so sentimental gooey and rings so false that it sets off siren in your head that makes you feel bit cheated ndavid spade who also cowrote the movie tries hard so very hard to make this project amusing nthere are some choice scenes that are quite funny but the movie is only sporadically funny npatrick bruel plays the stock character of rene the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over with his good looks and money njon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles ndespite few positive attributes lost and found just does nt work nif you re searching for an enjoyable romanticcomedy you could do far better than this obvious misguided failure that shows blatant disregard for what its trying to present
bthese days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run ns nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in nfew years in the future early are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia nhowever doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement ntwo of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies nthe authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines nthe plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct nthe best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers nthe rest simply does nt work nonly those who used to watch lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in while nbut at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of movie is simply not worth the effort nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of series that already had strong comic overtones nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon joke in their fourth sequel

bi was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory nthis was of course big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just hobby for me and never get chance at something like this nnot only did get to see an advance screening was able to see an advance screening of very good movie nthe very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher fasttalking witty comical taxi driver in new york city ngibsons performance is terrific and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films ngibson again teams up with richard donner as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick and this time around the combination works even better nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique ntry to imagine toneddowned version of travis bickle who this time around is jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups nif you can imagine that then you ve basically got jerry fletcher nin many ways was surprised by this movie nto begin with was surprised at how good it was ndont get me wrong its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring but it was very enjoyable movie nsecondly was surprised at mel gibsons performance nhe provided fantastic performance nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick which after viewing it was almost the opposite in certain sense ngibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners hilarious situations and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film nfor instance jerrys apartment and especially his security is memorable nand last was surprised at how good the plot is nwriter brian helgeland has created terrific story and when watching this film you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched or so they seem at first conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions nmel gibson is nt the only standout in the film njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton the department of justice employee who ca nt seem to stay away from jerry fletcher who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories she shrugs him and his beliefs off continually noting that one day she is going to slap restraining order on him njerry obviously determined to continually seek out the truth continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory which will be printed in his newsletter same title as the movie nalthough he only has five subscribers he puts large amount of time and effort into his work and publishes his next edition nvery soon after he does so he is abducted and tortured by sinister man who refers to himself as dr jonas patrick stewart nafter barely escaping alive jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust alice sutton nthe remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy nand more along the way the audience and alice learn more and more about jerrys life nmany things are explained throughout this film both to the characters and to the audience nfor instance the meaning of the book the catcher in the rye and its ties to assassins the reason lone gunmen have three names nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray and the real truth behind the grateful dead nmake sure listen closely throughout the film as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above ndefinitely when conspiracy theory hits theaters august th make sure you are standing in line to see it ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations nand even if you are nt you should still like this film
bin the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa nthe twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend year in prison than pay taxes to the despised government nafter being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest nwhen the marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl is nt alone nmany poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that nthat brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt nhowever his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement nafter betrayed thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight nuntil that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon nunfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script nsometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama should nt be non the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl non the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible nhowever film does deal with potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen should nt be the total waste of time

bin the stock market crashed and oliver stones wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses nwall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film resonation it might not of had and though its killorbekilled approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman nstone constructed his film as mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange ncritics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of contemporary classic nim proud to say that will never be counted as one of them ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stones output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen nstone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath heap of good intentions nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in plummeting airplane nits all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like ni have feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top nthese guys are salesmen after all not televised judges nmore than anything am baffled by why so many adore wall street nthe only possible solution can muster is its release date nand not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form and group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies nin my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as decade with not only proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes nmaybe stones after school special set in wall street was viewed as welcome change of pace nboiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stones piece of crap nthey both feature consequential fatherson relationship though boiler rooms is much more subtle and touching nand they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street nboiler room is message movie as well though at least until the end does nt shove it in our faces nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash nas said this film is indeed timely in society where who wants to be millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about revolution of prime time tv watching that has nt been seen in quite while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires nin our superjudgmental poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all nand seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way nhes wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him nben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like frat boy gordon gecko nhis job is to influence trainees into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving speech that subtly attacks their man hood nits ironic that he sells these pups the same load of that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers nafflecks character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwins similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actors performance naffleck shouts curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge nwhen alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing really hammy line reading nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters nthey are nt above rumble as test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes nwe drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be nas in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness ni know this story nwe all do nbut it can work if its told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it nas director of please excuse my french miseenscene younger has much to learn nhis style is sitcom bland nbut his writing is nt nyoungers script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like junior david mamet ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script nthe brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes tense confrontation between victimizer and victim who is nt aware that he is one nwith the exception of afflecks brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional nribisi who has the edgy looks of character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth nhe conveys childlike vulnerability his character seems to hide in corner whenever things are nt going his way in some scenes and in others he ferociously cut throat nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when its just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin nboiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences the sales build slowly like crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel kind broker who alternates between seths friend and his mentor ndiesl shines in his minor role nthis week saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays completely different role in an equally effective manner nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the nnicky katt is also memorable as superior broker obsessed with what he ca nt have nnia long as the firms secretary lone black women amongst many white men is ribisis love interest in part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting nthe two make an oddly likeable couple nlong is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof nat one point he says to her just lookin for some chocolate love nits terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way it becomes sweetly endearing nunfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns tad schmaltzy nthere is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares nthis is okay when taken in small doses but youngers conclusion is constructed as series of these boohoo moments one following the other na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seths manipulations have on one of his poor victims nits not bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message nthat message being greed is bad nyes its patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to culture that have nt seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur nand all wall street did was introduce us to simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners nboiler room offers neither extreme nit gives us what is in between and for that am thankful
byou know that movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing and nits not comedy nand what strange career path for director chuck russell nhe starts his career off with decent take on the nightmare on elm street series with his debut as director on installment number three nhe follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that nso then he thought let me wait another five years get weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes nstrange dude and one crappy flick nplot sixyear old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god na satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side while the girls aunt wants to well nsave her from those damn devil worshippers nenter one occult expert agent plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying and you ve just about got the gist of things here ncritique with plot holes the size of my ass this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ridden plot with wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot nwhats good about this movie nwell rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of creepy runaway childrens sheltersatanist supreme with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around nthe little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character does nt really do all that much nand believe it or not was actually enjoying some of the films first half hour which starts off with some promise but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist basinger just drown the films entire basis of believability nfor some reason it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes is na dumb one nadd that to the entire police force of incompetents save for jimmy smits whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be good career move nat least change the clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills and even less actual drama and you ve got yourself pretty bad movie nand why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ndid they owe the director favor or something ntogether they barely have five minutes of screen time but suppose that riccis hospital room scene might be worth look for some of you horndogs nthe worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of sneaking up on mans house who they know to be guilty of crime nuuuhmm how nabout knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass officers nanyway do nt usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof and there was plenty to go around nand did basinger lose some of her acting talent during her hiatus from the profession after her oscar win ndifficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad or if she just delivered them poorly neither way little originality very obvious computer effects little thrills little drama and very little entertainment value certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film nbut if you really do nt mind rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and kid based thrillers and enjoy watching films that do nt bring anything new to the table well ndrink some beers smoke some beans and rent this video because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year

bmy giant begins with monologue that more funny than not and distinctive princess bride medieval fairytaleinthe feel ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was with very funny scenes occurring on movie set in romania where talent agent sammy billy crystal is visiting client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into stream nand when sammy meets max his giant mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan there is magic in the air albeit it bit goofy loved every minute of it nthe film of course plays on the size difference between the two and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects ni particularly enjoyed shot of sammy dangling his legs from maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons ni also liked jere burns from tvs something so right performance as the director of the film in romania nat this point the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand particularly during his fastpaced first scene nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate as did understand him more as the film continued and became accustomed to his speech nhowever about the time muresan becomes coherent the characters head to new york and the film takes dive noff the high board nsuddenly we are expected to believe sammy is dowhateverittakes slime ball nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure but he did nt come off as desperate jerk nif he had the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical nbut now in new york we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son and his character is desperate enough to involve max in disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match which found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film nindeed many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal when sammy gets max role in big hollywood movie filming in las vegas nwhile enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation rather than because the film demanded it nand the audience is required to take huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare nat this point found myself thinking were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in film nthen realized he was and was watching it nin the final third the film undergoes another transformation this time to unbridled sentimentality nnote major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love lillianna who has nt seen him since he was normalsized kid nher refusal to see max unbeknownst to him leads us to an awkward ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena played nicely by kathleen quinlan poses as lillianna ni found this scene offensive nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm fuzzy feelings from the audience it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle which thought was quite undeserved ni think max could have handled the truth gratuitous illness and all nlate in the film we learn max and in fact all giants have heart condition which shortens their lives considerably nthis could be an enlightening revelation but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into caring sensitive guy and hey great dad and husband too nmy giant suffers from poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become better person nin this scenario maxs illness could have been integral part of the film not story motivator nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally ninstead were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end but were not allowed to focus on max ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances but in the end my giant left me feeling like been fed gruel from giant spoon
bmovies do nt come much more ridiculously titled than still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as warning nmore than sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequels moniker also contains grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did last summer you actually did the summer before last summer and since knew about it this summer as well as last summer its really illogical to say that still know what you did last summer nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter still know the longer still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart nfor example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow cute little dress nprobably not but that precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in long line of phony frights njulie you ll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of surprise hit know what you did last summer after slasher with grudge to bear its long story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village nin this installment the plot picks up as karla wins trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe tropical getaway will help ease her mind nyeah right ntheir island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the stillalive killer muse watson from the first film nhe sports the same gortons fisherman getup heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why he still trying to stay anonymous is mystery this movie never solves nthough suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of leisure suit nin sense that the movies glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaways derivative still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in tanning bed giving him perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do nhe twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays you think he want her gutted now instead of skin cancer victim later neven prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into know unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo you ll cheer not shriek when he ends up with pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest nif know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly still know what you did last summer deserves fullblown roasting on mystery science theatre

bever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking nthese films usually show the audience look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous nif its not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes nto anyone familiar with computers andor the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you ca nt take it anymore nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies nwell imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally illinformed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology nand truthfully this is onehundred percent correct nthe plot obviously centers around computer hacking nmore specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers nthe film opens with young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems nhe was forbidden to use computer until he turned eighteen years old nthe film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi noh and as little subplot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film nreally ca nt think of much more to say about the films plot aside from what ve said nits just bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi nthanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do nthis movie makes computers look little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list nto sum it up hackers is terrible computer film nif you re looking for film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world suggest sneakers nalthough at times it too may seem little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users nhopefully this film did nt influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this minute waste of time
bthat is unless you re one of those people who have seen the preview thousand times on tv or in the theaters ni can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away nwhy someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me nhowever if they had nt given it away the film would ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter nobviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and couple of cliches and call it an action drama double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he did nt see to be on screen half as much as judd did nit also offers some genuinely funny clever or fulloftension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot nhalf the time wondering whether watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised njudging by the beginning end and huge chunk of the middle might have been watching special hallmark presentation too nthe movies stretching for an almost two hour long film with only minutes worth of material nimplausible material no less nloose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie thought that is not possible nthat kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama neverything seems dragged out overplayed nwhen they should ve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early
bwell ill admit when first heard about this film which was before dantes peak could just smell what twister had started nso now it seems that were in full fledged return to the disaster film era nwith twister dantes peak volcano and soon flood and james camerons extremly expensive titanic nill say first off enjoyed volcano much more than did dantes peak npart of that is just being biased as usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in nive been reading lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really did nt see or think that once during the entire film ni get bored easily and this film did nt bore me for minute nanother thing and boy am bitching today that bothers me is when critics and such go on about well that not really possible nyou know what ni could nt give bloody damn if its possible or not really could nt nits freaking movie and do nt want reality thrown in my face ni want to be able to see the impossible the all might what if to many reviewers have seen one to many movies nthe special effects are the second star to this feature nthey are so amazing that found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground nthey did an incredible job and come oscar time if they remember some notice better be thrown there way

bevery once in while when an exceptional family film comes along will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many nondisney films disappear in couple of weeks nnow see that in so doing have unfairly ghettoized these films nso am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic filmmaking see matilda nsee it in theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video nsee the best film have seen in nnot the best childrens film the nbest film nperiod nbased on story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman simpleminded bingo addict nthe wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books nwhen they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall bleak place run by cruel childhating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris nbut things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness nmatilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbulls cruelty nit was this springs james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda nand just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cockeyed direction of danny devito ndevito made black humor key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images nin one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pigtails and flung through the air like throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing dessert nmatilda is just twisted enough to be perfect fairy tale nit is also characteristic of the best childrens tales that they manage to teach lessons in such way that children almost do nt realize that they are learning them nthere is hilarious moment when matildas televisionaddicted father snatches away the book she is reading in wicked joke he thinks moby dick is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in booth filled with cash blowing around nmatilda is story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for child that because big and you re little right and you re wrong nmore specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent selfconfident girl who struggles successfully against other peoples notions of how she should behave nit is no coincidence that matilda was cowritten by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women nfinally matilda has that quality find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word ndevito knows enough to make matilda fastpaced and appealing to children taking deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including great chase through her dark house nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda clever and extremely likeable character nbut there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion there is also deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father ni ca nt imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted nmatilda is film which left me glowing with good feeling ni will see it again and years from now will watch it with my children nand now will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is seat in that theater you should be in if you have child or ever were child
party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ve seen in awhile na late ripoff of the meatballs series the film follows group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk nthats really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wisecracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for cute blonde kerry brennan and there is big contest in the climax nhow fun nsince party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative nits not that think exploitation is necessarily good quality but when you are talking about dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with lot of mindless sex neven psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick nat least then it would nt have been such chore to sit through nnever before have seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat nthe comedy was easy to spot but it was nt the least bit funny nit was groaninducing nconstantly throghout was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything nso what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating nwell that simple jewel shepard as flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add little spice to an otherwise rancid lowbudget teen comedy
the faculty the heavilyhyped and advertised scifihorror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez desperado and from dusk till dawn and screenwriter kevin williamson scream and scream is being called cross between invasion of the body snatchers and the breakfast club and do nt think could describe it any better than that nthe film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common and then the sciencefiction aspect is added involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town nthe six characters as in the breakfast club can be easily labeled as stereotype but as they are developed they become far more complex casey elijah wood the much picked upon nerd stokely clea duvall goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being lesbian so everyone will avoid her zeke josh hartnett drug dealer who turns out to be science whiz stan shawn hatosy the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics delilah jordanna brewster the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist and marybeth laura harris the sweet southern new girl in town nalthough the characters are only slightly connected ncasey is delilahs photojournalist assistant marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely since they both do nt have friends etc when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences the only people they can count on for help is each other even though they are nt really even sure if they can trust one another the faculty is another smart and popculturally hip film from williamson although it does not equal up to his best film the original scream and rodriguez whose from dusk till dawn is still one of the more original genre films of the nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions respectively that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much nobrainer nthe plotline of the faculty involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies has been done quite lot before from invasion of the body snatchers to the puppet masters to invaders from mars so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh and by setting the goingson at high school and having the protagonists be group of teens they were mostly successful nsurely the conventions of the story are still the same and the climax was inevitable but there were few surprises along the way including the question of who were the aliens and who were nt nthe epilogue was also refreshing changeofpace as it did not set up sequel but ended on note that probably could not have been any better nthe performances in the faculty were treat throughout since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do none exception were the teens who aside from elijah wood are not very wellknown but they all aquit themselves nicely particularly wood the seasoned pro clea duvall and jordanna brewster nas members of the faculty robert patrick judgement day was creepy as the gym coach piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien and salma hayek as the school nurse with bad case of the cold was very funny in small role nthe standout in my opinion of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who after turning into an alien becomes the sex bombshell nif there was any problem had with the faculty it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the queen alien many of the faculty members disappear nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers although the finale is still pretty impressive and includes some showstopping creature effects especially for relatively low milliondollar budget nalthough not one of the best horror or sciencefiction films have seen the faculty is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released nwhile the story is as old as the hills it is also in way timeless because everyone think has suspected at one time or another that certain person simply did not act right as if they really were nt human nand by putting this idea in the setting of smalltown high school it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers note the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading as it features artist usher raymond as one of the main characters nin actuality he only has small role as one of stans buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team nif were one of the heads from dimension would change this advertising at once since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving
beight years after its release disney has decided to rerelease the little mermaid theatrically for days and long nights only ncoincidentally it was reintroduced to theaters the same day foxs animated film anastasia was released nyou know disney they ca nt deal with the threat of any other studio getting even small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie so when someone else wants to make little money they counter with an old masterpiece from their vault and you know what went to see this cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market nthey still have hotels on boardwalk and park place nbelieve it or not today november at saw the little mermaid for the first time nit took me few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago when stayed with one of my moms friends for couple weeks nthey had young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and over that two week period heard every song from the movie probably hundred times nby the time got back home promised myself never see the movie nbut promises are made to be broken especially when you re looking at day limited engagement ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games nthe little mermaid is based on hans christian anderson fairy tale but its disneyized which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song nit also means the heroine is total babe who shows off cleavage from seashell bra at all times ni never wanted so much to be pair of shells nthe heroine of course is ariel voice of jodi benson yearold mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase nshe skips her concert to explore wrecked ship and hang out with seagull that talks like buddy hackett who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans nshes also dealing with feelings she has nt had before which comes when you get scales in places you did nt use to have them about handsome prince no disney movie would be complete without one nher father king triton of the merpeople strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the savage humans in condemnation that reads as notsosubtle analogy about old fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating nwhats king to do though nthe girls in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world does nt deter her nariel saves the princes life when hurricane rises up and just has to meet him nshe makes deal with ursula the sea witch voice of pat carroll nyou know she evil because she has huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet something those dr scholls corn pads will not fix and offers to help ariel out nshell make her human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her or else she becomes slave to the witch forever nand if she pricks her finger on sewing machine or eats an evil apple shell fall asleep forever nits simplistic plot yes but the little mermaid was revolution in the disney world coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons certainly since the nall the elements are there memorable songs like under the sea and kiss the girl cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder an evil villain who still has characterization and charm and fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children nthe little mermaid is worth bigscreen ticket in so hurry up you only have five days left nserving america for more than th of century
bmars attacks jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones nthis is director tim burtons finest film to date nmany will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films nhowever as whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than and loved nyou really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film nit is completely wackedout and unlike anything you ve ever seen nonce the silly tone of the film is set its easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do nt mix nthe plot is simple martians invade the earth nbut its different than any other invasion film nusually its the evil aliens versus the heroic humans nthis time however its the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans nthe martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things ve seen in long time nthey look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious nand about the special effects nthe effects in mars attacks nare just about the most flawless ones ve seen to date nthe computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem real nthere are just couple of scenes that do nt work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship nalso glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise nbut there are many big laughs in the film as said if you are in the right mood ncould it have been funnier ncertainly nwas it funny enough nyes nwas entertained nabsolutely non personal note like to thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the film as warcrazy general decker nfinally after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in real movie that many people will see nwhile he not given the type of role that you can give real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue nthe preview audience saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him
bi think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not am fan of the xfiles nfirst let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie nthe producers are not stupid making movie just for fans of the series is not profitable nyou have to reach for larger audience ntherefore the movie is quite userfriendly naltough nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange nbut fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera nin any case the answer is no ni am not fan of the xfiles only watch it when nothing else is on and prefer millennium nhowever since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend took that opportunity to test the movie ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie am glad to report that learned nothing new neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others ni know am going maybe bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie nwarning major spoilers follow nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about nyou have been warned nthe xfiles is what summer should be nexciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances nthis is coming from guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of wooden plank nfrom start to finish this movie does not let go of you nwhen compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon nthis flick is scary not in movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes nin fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd nthe last time monster scared me that much was when first saw aliens as six year old kid nyou know when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt nso yeah the xfiles is scary nand guess what nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster ndo not think that the xfiles is monster movie nin fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total nno the xfiles is definately mulder episode of the series nscully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time nshe has couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much nno this is mulders time in the spotlight nby now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day nif you have not then will not spoil it for you lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who ncares nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open door or climb hill nthe script is spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose nif you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and can not stress this enough pay attention nunlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects nmiss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense nalso to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies do nt nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation nthere is no time to take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves purpose nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks nso far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by nose nbut the truman show is not what would call summer movie the xfiles is nwhat more do you ask from summer movie other than the chance to be excited ncool effects nits good some npulse pounding nhell yes nstrangely enough think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have good time nit does not provide answers to the shows many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together nrating four and half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming nmoments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending nyou may wonder where this movie lost half star nwell swore never to give movie the full five stars so had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop nits pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving
bapollo is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart ndirector and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic film making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer with more than us million in the states alone this film is his most successful effort yet nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles napollo was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident njim lovell hanks the mission commander together with his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way to the moon nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home nif they ever reach it ned harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles both delve into their roles superbly naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space nalso there are quite number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into days of drama in nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks to filmmusic maestro james horner nwatch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film na bad point though apollo features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script nthose who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show nthis is however just minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film nyou should enjoy it

bi remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over year ago picking up the grand jury prize at the festival nholocaust comedy receives standing ovation the headlines read nintrigued by this statement looked up information on the film and found that sure enough life is beautiful is in fact comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years neven though the movie was extremely wellreceived by critics and public alike could nt help but be disgusted at this notion human tragedy is not something feel should be celebrated nonly now do see the error of my ways nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time it became clear that it is not as the headlines proclaimed holocaust comedy on the contrary life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps nrather it focuses on the relationship between father and his son who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation nroberto benigni who also wrote and directed the movie stars as guido orefice chaplininspired clown and all round jolly guy who as the film opens is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher nicoletta braschi benigni real life spouse nthrough the course of the first hour or so we see guido striving to get the attention of this beautiful princess as he calls her nemploying the magic of laughter the italian comedian wins her heart and together they raise young boy named giosue child actor giorgio cantarini nlife treats them well until hitlers minions rise to power and the family is whisked away to german camp where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his sons innocence no matter what the sacrifice ngranted it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp but it does not pull hogans heros and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews nsomehow it achieves hilarity without disrespecting its gravely serious subject nso we ve established that life is beautiful is not holocaust comedy nbut there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me nthe film despite critics declarations of it being triumph of the human spirit is no such thing not in my eyes anyway nsome have called the story an affirmation of the beauty of life but say it is very dark and bleak statement about mans capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy nthe films ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently but found it to be truly discerning and upsetting nessentially life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film nhowever am not denying the movies greatness nbelieve me its fantastic nim just saying that think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as nbut perhaps reading more into the movie than is really there nmaybe the films brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit nin fact maybe roberto benigni has made film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of movie exactly what you put into it
bwhile watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as filmmaker is casting nin fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penns jeff spicoli in look who talking she turned bruce willis into wisecracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival in clueless she found star vehicle for the adorableness that is or was alicia silverstone nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws nunfortunately she may also be starting to understand that she understands ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies ngiving appealing actors script in which their appeal is the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser nnaturally heckerling makes her protagonist an allaround swell guy npaul tannek jason biggs is smalltown boy who gets scholarship to nyu then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman his roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski and noah jimmi simpson are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar in this case the lovely dora diamond mena suvari ndora has problems of her own including shortage of funds to pay her tuition and relationship with professor edward alcott greg kinnear that more than slightly onesided ntheyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people so clearly they belong together even if paul is loser ni must confess that for while was suckered in by heckerlings casting njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace suvari is coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence ntheyre pleasant enough to watch and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists are nt nthen it gradually becomes clear that there virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort nin theory loser is romantic comedy but there is scarcely laugh to be found in the entire film notable exception cameo by scenestealing comic actor as video store clerk ninstead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny heckerling spends minutes making her characters situations pathetic nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless nor any of that films interest in lively plotting not surprisingly since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma nshe simply turns the film into pity party nsince loser is film composed almost entirely of establishing character you might think that those characters would be interesting or at least slightly complicated ninstead you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there no reason to watch them npaul is nt just nice guy he flawless consequently he central character who does absolutely no growing nhis roommates are nt just inconsiderate they re actively evilblackmailing professor alcott drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity bad name nand professor alcott is nt just manipulative he turns dora into his house slave ndoras unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser and even that is nt explored in sufficient detail ntheres more ambiguity in the second snippet from alan cummings broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser its one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations its another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow ni do nt know ncomic nstill spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkels scarborough faircanticle ninstead of giving the sequence knowing winka reference to the graduate hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight neven in the scenes that scream for light comic touch and bit of poke at her protagonists foibles she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint ncluelesss cher had her selfabsorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness nin loser amy heckerling shows leaden hand with material that demands friskiness her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm hunts hall after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall nher gift with casting proved to be her curse nloser may be crashing bore but gee are nt those two kids swell
bbrian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him nsadly he forget to bring good story and believable characters nnic cage plays rick santaro fast talking cop who is watching boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise nan assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together nhowever the film does nt keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at dead end nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma including minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead nthe problem is that de palma does nt have strong story or characters to work with nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and quickly got bored nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but its no use nthey are boring faceless and completely unlikeable nyes another problem with the film is that there noone to root for nwere supposed to be on cages side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film nhowever his change is sadly unbelievable npoor gary sinises character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way nthe films use of flashback quickly gets boring nwhile clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go nthey certainly do nt increase the tension or suspense of the movie nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly does nt make this film powerhouse thriller rather just slightly below average one nthe script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional ncertainly not good factors for film passing itself off for thriller nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential ntheres good story buried in snake eyes its just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks nit also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end nwhile the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case there no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is terminal case of style of substance and unless you re big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided na david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes
bit is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time nbased on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue nhowever as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction nfrank darabont who masterfully followed prisoners story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks nthrough edgecombs experiences on cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kindhearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect nhanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan nhutchinson playing percy wetmore cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie nevery time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks nrockwell an independent film veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection nas prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill nduncan does wonderful job playing frightened childlike behemoth very similar to lennie small in of mice and men nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause nhis pain creates pain for the viewer nhowever it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film nthe film opens with ridiculous present day setting which contains scene that jabs at the jerry springer show nthe scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief nas the film flashes back to graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing ngreene is not even given final word like some of the other characters and we do nt even see him walk the infamous green mile nhowever as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the film becomes more interesting nthe speed in the green mile is perfect nif time was matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film great amount of love or hate is attached to each character the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene nfighting back tears was difficult task that barely succeeded in doing nif you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment

bthis summer one of the most racially charged novels in john grishams series time to kill was made into major motion picture non january of this year director rob reiner basically rereleased the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi nbased on the true story of civil rights leader medgar evars assassination ghosts of mississippi revolves around the year legal battle faced by myrlie evars whoopi goldberg sister act and her quest to have her husbands obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith james woods casino jailed nso she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter alec baldwin heavens prisoners to imprison the former kkk member nghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from africanamerican history from slaveship miseries to life in the racist south of the nbut all too soon the white folks take over intoning lines like what america got to do with anything nthis is mississippi nas beckwith james woods with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man teeters between portraying evil and its character nmeanwhile goldberg turns in very serious and weepy performance as the wife who would nt let her husbands death rest until she got the conviction nboth deserve serious oscarconsideration nthis brings us to the dull performance of baldwin nlets face it trying to match matthew mcconaugheys wonderful acting in time to kill is basically impossible nand baldwin is living proof of this as no emotions could be felt nit seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed single tear neither poor acting or poor directing but something definitely went wrong nanother strange mishap was the fact that goldbergs facial features did nt change as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husbands dead body years earlier nyet woods was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldbergs father nat least the makeup was realistic nwith some emotional moments in the poorly written script ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart when its predecessor time to kill brought tears to everyones eyes ndont get me wrong the movie was nt all that bad but if you ve seen grishams masterpiece then do nt expect this one to be an excellent film
bthe italian hitchcock and acknowledged master of the giallo murdermystery dario argento again offers us fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena nthis time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino jennifer connelly bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects nsent to girls boarding school in switzerland she soon learns of series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the schools population terrified na chance meeting with brilliant entomologist donald pleasance leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift nphenomena is an imaginative original thriller nwriterdirector argento creates several sequences of surreal haunting beauty here including masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and striking scene when swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifers beckoning nthe plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killers identity is genuinely shocking and surprising nthe director took big gamble with soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden exrolling stone bill wyman and argentos favourite gothicelectronic outfit goblin nbut it gels surprisingly well nthe films opening music reccurs several times an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone nargento fans beware the film was released outside europe in terribly butchered form retitled as creepers nthis deleted nearly half an hour of footage mainly of key dialogue scenes
showgirls is the first bigbudget bigstudio film to receive an nc rating nand its release last year came at time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence nbut if showgirls is any indication of hollywoods future the folks in washington should focus their attack on more dangerous threat to american valuesbad moviemaking showgirls is relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter ndirector paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shockvalue project basic instinct follow the plight of young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make name for herself as topless dancer nits hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out ntheres the demanding producer nthe loyal friend nthe bitchy competitor nlest forget the scummy club owner nof course any attempt at character development or coherent storyline is just window dressing for the films main attractionan endless parade of fullfrontal nudity nunfortunately showgirls does nt satisfy in this department nverhoevens slambang inyourface style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic nto make matters worse you ll be forced to sit through the movies clothed scenes which do nt cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history nverhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if its adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel nyoull be the wiser for it
btheres good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first new movie about the abuses of our prison system nwith country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare to recent american moviesa point of view nbut director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important ntheres not moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling nand everything suffers nchristian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively nafter spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial nhis young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined to put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman nthe result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students ntheres very little to praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story ntheres lot of overacting from everyoneyou know you re in trouble right away when lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as judge the center of reason and moderation nslater has never been convincing and certainly is nt here and oldman is on bad streak of hammy performances nbut the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling good story nthere are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone with them nhow frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions nif there anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability to tell good story nhave we forgotten

bshakespeare you hardly understood it in high school nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade does nt count on it nif this is your attitude then ill say right off the bat that kenneth branaghs hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now nif however you are lover of the bard or at the very least are openminded about challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark nnamely the king has died and his widow the queen has we the kings brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brothers hands nhamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery and nthe game is afoot nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers nthe hamlet castles grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirrorpanel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides of secondstory loft ncostuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination nnot quite the denmark of the the characters attire is something of cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the film more of timeless feel nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively nin addition to directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character nas the revengedriven royal heir branagh provides riveting performance of emotional highs and lows nfrom the anticipation of seeing his fathers ghost to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester to his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet as much tribute to branaghs acting and directing as to shakespeares manuscript nhamlet seems to be who who of shakespeareantrained actors so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is delight in itself njulie christie as hamlets mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players nkate winslet as hamlets lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the characters plummet to the depths of dispair and madness nrichard briers as ophelias father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing nnicholas farrell as hamlets trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the twotiming rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast nhamlet also seems to be film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible nin some cases this made for interesting scenes nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of classic actor and the verbal countenance of comedian and the result is very funny scene nhowever charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all nas the player king the leader of troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba npart of his monologue is overlaid with visual enactment of the story with sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time nhis offcamera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene to narration done by any other wellvoiced actor ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention nunfortunately there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions njack lemmon an excellent actor just ca nt do shakespeare nas marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlets ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him ngerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo nrichard attenborough has literally walkon role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador ni think he had two lines nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway nwhen went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you nhamlet is complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashbacktype images nthis only works about half the time and wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them nyou do nt have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar the high school english course nin it you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding play written in the rigmarole known as the kings english nor suppose you could just read the cliff notes

bno it is not bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose actually wished for the film to end itself quickly nevent horizon is not your runofthemill scifi film sure many who have watched this will agree with me nit is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical buildup that makes it wonderfully horrifying nthe story brings us to the year where space travel have since enormously progressed nthe event horizon is actually ship built for secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in mans lifetime nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune na search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon nthe designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship nevent horizon is scifi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be nwhile in alien the crew has to cope with ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where really felt like saying out loud enough ni ca nt stand this anymore nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards neven so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its wellpaced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ndirector paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror nthis picture did not do very well in the us boxoffice most probably for the dreadfactor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this nalthough on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for massentertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus nhowever the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing nmy friend and could not say word to each other for quite while after going through the experience of event horizon ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us nbe forewarned this film is not for the fainthearted nor for pure entertainment nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film nevent horizon is highly recommended but at your own risk nit has been long time since goodhorror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one
breflecting on bedazzled lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind nif hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way nwith her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation nits practically impossible to turn this beelzubabe down nher next target is elliot brendan fraser tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please nto aptly picture him you would have to remember saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his coworkers with his unpolished social skills neugene thus is loathed and feared by his coworkers who do their best to stay out of his way nyet beyond his annoying mannerisms he lovable oaf nhe wishes that he could get closer to allison frances oconnor coworker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him nhowever the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as snowballs chance in hell dear god he prays would give anything to have that girl in my life nguess who then shows up nshe makes an offer that is too hard to refuse seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul ntheres even an escape clause nif elliots wish does nt go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the threedigit number is and he gets to start over nthe remainder of the film consists of elliots various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allisons love nbut when he makes sweeping statements such as want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison hell soon learn that the devil is in the details nfor example and we ve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that he columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else napparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul nhis other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that shortcircuits his new life nsoon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal ngiven the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments na lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in great comic performance nhe ably assumes various personas nhis funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world nallison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her nhurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one nits clear that she having good time with it all nyet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story nbut that would be playing with fire nwhat they ve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is
bthe art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness nthe problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sookyin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible nalessa is young woman who happens to be brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene nthis is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland none of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa nshe also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window nnext door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach nhe sees that behind the facade that there is really sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating nben gets emotionally involved with alessa as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now were fuck buddies nbut alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor nthe real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying nshe undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa nalessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients nthis appears to be high profile and wellpaid job nwe are supposed to care about alessas feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father nalessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint nthis is charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero ni rate it on the to scale and on the to scale

crazybeautiful suffers from the damnedifyoudo damnedifyoudont syndrome nafter spate of flighty cookiecutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story nbut rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special neven worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got case of the heebiejeebies and forced director john stockwell to reshoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down nneedless to say the filmmaker was frustrated we were trying to make cautionary tale he told newsweek and we could nt show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from nregardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and script determined to transcend stereotypes crazybeautiful is quality fare good enough that halfexpected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes nset in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens nevery morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes twohour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school nan honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing place in the naval academy nall is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of rich congressman bruce davison nnicole is drunk apparently hellbent on selfdestruction ncarlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile nplus as her father notes she has real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral nas with save the last dance crazybeautiful god how hate lowercase titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh nwhile noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich there are still several mtv moments though nthe filmmakers make point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there ncuteasabutton dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicoles behavior nshe is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down hoped the boy would listen nas carlos hernandez is revelation nhunky without looking like the product of hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see lot of this guy in the future naside from its title the biggest problem with crazybeautiful is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy nafter carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy nstill this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots afterschool special my ass crazybeautiful is the real deal

frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime min nus distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements ncopyright nathaniel atcheson na fellow critic once stated his belief that reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review nive attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case nthe fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them nthe original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people nfor me they calibrated my creativity as child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well ni am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that does nt make me any less dedicated to it non the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on very short list of why love movies nwhen heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series got exited nwhen first saw screenshots from the film well over year ago embarked on yearlong drool of anticipation nand when the first previews were released last thanksgiving was ready to see the film nbut then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture nin the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater was tired of hearing about it ni was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever went to kfc or taco bell ni just wanted to see the movie nreader do not misunderstand ni did not have an antihype reaction nthe hype was unavoidable ni understand and accept the hype its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released nfive minutes into the phantom menace knew there was problem who are these jedi knights ni asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity why are nt these characters being developed before their adventures why is there special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film nthese were just some of my questions early on nlater asked where the magic of the first three films nand why am looking at my watch every fifteen minutes nby the end of the film was tired maddened and depressed ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster nthe phantom menace is no star wars film ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time nits an embarrassment ni looked desperately for scene in which character is explored or new theme is examined or special effects shot is nt used nthere are few of each but they re all token attempts nthe fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for movie and pretty good showcase for digital effects nthis is not what wanted to see ni did nt want to leave the phantom menace with headache and bitter taste in my mouth but did nthe story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo nnaboo is the victim of bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people nafter picking up jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august nquigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters nthere is nt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form nthe way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory nfirst of all we do nt learn one single thing about quigon jinn nnot one thing nwhat was his life like before this film nwell imagine he did nt have one nthats why he feels like plot device nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why he recently retired from film do nt blame him honestly nobiwan character was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting nmcgregor has just few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in great performance is urged to look elsewhere nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film and lloyd does thoughtful job with the role ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother found it moving nalso fairly good is portman and she manages to give little depth to character where no depth has been written njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ve ever had to endure but he more interesting than most of the humans nas soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes nive seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie nthe reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint ni ca nt say that did nt find the effects original because did the final battle between darth maul obiwan and quigon is visually exceptional as is most of the film nbut also found the effects deadening and tiresome nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through digital sky and wanted that to go away ncant we have one stinking scene that is nt bursting at the seems with special effects shot ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that really just wanted to go outside and look at physical landscape for few hours nand then there the question of magic nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ni have feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel njohn williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction ni think it comes right down to characters there are none here ni longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but got no such thing nand what about the ridiculous expectations nmine were nt that high simply wanted film that showed me the roots of the films that grew up loving story that had few characters and few great special effects ninstead got two hours and fifteen minutes of lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show ni do nt hate the phantom menace as much as resent it like to forget that it exists and yet ca nt nits here to stay ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they do nt then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
bthe event of events is upon us npeople have waited twentytwo years for the prequel to star wars and diehard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it ni do nt think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of film has caused nit is not bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history nanyone who tells you its just movie is either lying or clueless nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak word that star wars epsode the phantom menace so effortlessly generated nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad nin fact it is terrific ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash nit is set some decades before the events of the original star wars took place nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo nthe republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene non the way they get sidetracked to planet called tatooine where they meet the movies real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd nhe is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as jedi nas any selfrespecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker nfrom the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie naround of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jarjar binks nhes essentially computeranimated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me nand mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying nthe visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is thrilling triumph nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement nthe climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you did nt already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie nwhat made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score by john williams neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant nhis use of opera during the climax really does add punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as sort of prophecy is chilling nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia nwhen you see long time ago in galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen you ll feel tingle even if you did nt see the movie when it first came out in nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not nwe not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like were seeing the beginning of saga that we have cherished for years nthe phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is very worthy installment in the star wars nit works as an action flick visually eyepopping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories piece of exquisite nostalgia eugene novikov
bi hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in black is not the best movie of the summer nits pretty good in its own right yes but would probably split the best movie honors among faceoff spawn con air and maybe event horizon nits main problem is that its quickly forgettable and ca nt remember one truly good scene from it nfrom con air it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt nin spawn it was the living room hell conclusion at the end nin event horizon it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hells forces nand all of faceoff was pretty dang good nbut as for men in black the only scene still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches ni remember it not for its humor but because am hate roaches with passion and was pretty disgusted nand yes did see mimic which is something ill touch on in later review nback to men in black is it just me or does that sound funny ni remember first hearing about men in black back when was comic geek in the th grade and read magazines like wizard etc for those of you who are nt comicgeeks wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars what the new yorker is to high society what boys life is to boy scots nokay that one was pretty pathetic nfew people know this but men in black is based on very obscure comic book that was while not honestpoliticianrare very hard to find nthis was after the release of the highgrossing batman forever and it said that tommy lee jones and chris odonnell were being considered for the roles in the comic book there were no black men in black nkind of weird huh nall can say is thank god they did nt cast chris odonnell ni know ca nt be the only person on the planet who thinks he an annoying preppie little snot nsorry nmy apologies to odonnell fans ni actually had th grade teacher who was big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him anticipating rather craftily that if the movie was big hit it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely nhe decided not to sell them to me because they were innappropriate nhmm nso now you re probably wondering why ve wasted about paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years ngood question nill move on to the movie now nas you probably already know will smith and tommy lee jones agents and respectively belong to top secret agency known as divison or its nickname mib men in black nmen in black is reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth nnot to get too technical or spoil the plot for the people in the world who have nt seen this movie but basicallybigroachtypebug lands in redneck farmers yard inhabits his body and attempts to destroy the entire universe nnot bad eh have no idea why just typed that nim not even really paying attention anymore nthe special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black ni found their main headquarters to be boring as were the cool weapons they had nthe noisy cricket just plain sucked no matter what anyone said nand the movie definitely surprised me in tone although it probably shoudlnt have nits director barry sonnenfield is known for black humor directing both addams family movies nthis movie was basically black comedy not an actionscifi like expected from the trailers ndont get me wrong on what think of this movie nits not bad gave it nit was mostly entertaining throughout its run and had very good ending although think was the only person in the theater not amazed by it nmy diagnosis for this picture good weekend rental but not worth movie ticket nof course the movie is now long gone from theaters but that beside the point ni think
ball feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands nthank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away nyour influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon nit is nt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of story if you include enough bells and whistles nwelcome to the club scott kalvert nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional serving only as the vehicle for performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as whole ndicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poetsongwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based nas the film opens jim is budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw none night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin njims addiction to the drug starts him on downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school nalong with mickey and pedro jim becomes victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as character was too unsympathetic and too much loner nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse resulting in jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends nas film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as cautionary tale minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie njim is sort of jerk even before he becomes junkie but suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be saw him simply as part of the bad crowd nwithout character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack ndirector scott kalvert does nt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing non only one occasion when steady pan around room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective nmostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is nthey also do nt allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been nfor every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert wo nt let character interaction define this story nhe wants to turn dicaprio into rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting nat isolate moments the basketball diaries is fine showcase for dicaprios talents nfar more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what long form velvet underground video might have looked like
bi wonxt even pretend that have seen the other alien films ni saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them nso take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies was munching into after hard dayxs work ni didnxt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning nsigourney weaver whoxs role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of xripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien years later scientistsx use sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her nin no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than normal being nixm sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now wexll just ignore it and move on nwhy you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated nwell the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research nthey yawn were wrong nit doesnxt take genius to figure out that the rest of the film is continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth ntherexs little saying that goes something like this xif youxre going to make bad film do it well ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me nalien resurrection good example of film that really gets up my nose is not so much discouraging experience but an off putting one nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot nin one scene my stomach churned as witnessed mawkish looking alien put its hand on characters head and literally ripped most of his face off nanother one featured ripley sticking knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to nfair enough if it were in horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable nif you think ixm struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right none exciting scene is credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one cripple up tall ladder with interesting results nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis nso in film where the one liners come as bad as xearth man what shit holex and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is noh and in case youxre wondering about my bag of lollies the less enjoy film the more eat nso all the lollies were gone in minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still long way ahead of the moviex

knock off is exactly that cheap knock off of an action movie nits also the worst movie have seen thus far this year ni figured it would be at least couple of months before saw the worst film of but alas it has already been found njeanclaude van damme stars as think designer jeans executive who discovers his halfbrother has been supplying him with cheaper goods nrob schneider plays van dammes partner and rochon plays nactually have no idea who rochon was supposed to be nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there nmany things are not explained in this film but do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing jackie chan impression throughout the flick nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as wimp nwere never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions nto be more clear did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong ntsui hark who directed van dammes last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for second and that no exaggeration nwe are even treated to five second shot from the point of view of van dammes foot entering shoe nfabulous nseriously though have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they do nt get carried away nfor example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story nthats concept that tsui ca nt seem to grasp nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience does nt have clue as to what happening any more nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that thought was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night nand for some inexplicable reason everyones voice seems to have been dubbed neven the stars nand even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent nfor example there is scene in which van damme drives car out of window nthe car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed nseconds later the car drives off at full speed nhey have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but line must be drawn somewhere nfinally the acting nnobody gives good performance in this film nvan damme an actor usually like is way off the mark playing everyman nand schneider here to provide comic relief assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives terribly overthetop performance as nonce again have no idea who he was supposed to be nin case have nt yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van dammes career and possibly the worst movie of the decade nand its not even one of those movies that so bad its funny nits too inept to be funny nthere are no redeeming factors in knock off and seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased
bdisillusioned and trying to find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand nthere he meets crazed man by the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him map to beach secret utopia then commits suicide nrichard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen nonce they get there the three discover secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise nthis covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element which is solely creation of hollywood seems to hold to the original novel nthe cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking ni do nt think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning nbut that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography nthough the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking nthe plot of the movie moves along at decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts nthis is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is turn for the better yes folks said better nnow up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise nthis is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost unwatchable nthere is even video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it does nt make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and am hoping many other peoples ni am hoping that in my little rant ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you do nt like it because of this do nt blame me nthe character development was not up to par either found the character of richard to be nothing more than spoiled child nalthough there is feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard leos character comes off as wannabe philosopher nthe character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but nor anyone know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does nthe next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough nrichard is obviously obsessed by fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line nthis am sure contributes to the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused nnow shall move onto something little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have few good things about it nthe cast and acting was passable at the very least and think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard nmind you think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better nwhich begs the question why is leonardo paid so much think this is topic all on its own so wo nt get into it nbut like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used can see this movie being horrible nthe international flavor added more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable nnot to mention the movie is set in thailand and global cast makes more sense nwhen all is said and done liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable ni would not recommend this movie to anyone the fact that liked it has lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story nas it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt nif you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings

bthis movie stinks nalthough it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss ni knew was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color nthis might seem like minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow nand what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is recruit on his first day of training nor what about when brenner tells suspect that because he is in the military he does nt have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through nfor example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing nbut instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him nduh nultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter young captain also assigned to the post nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter does he use them to generate suspect list and begin grilling suspects nno his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing neventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier ni wo nt even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime ni will just mention one final flaw nbrenner is investigating crime that occurred in georgia nthe rape occurred in west point which is in new york nhe is under very tight and totally implausible hour deadline to solve this case nhe needs to discuss the rape with psychiatrist at west point ndoes he phone the doctor nno he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline nyou have been warned stay away from this one

bno humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film nall recipes are fictions ntwentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism na psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ndirectorwriter antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves they were party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive nthis true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into minutes long motion picture nin the united states was land of pioneers of goldstarved americans making their way west nit was period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could ncapt john boyd guy pearce has become both hero and victim during this period of relentless consumption nin ways he could never have imagined nboyds journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during horrific mexicanamerican war battle earns him banishment to desolate military outpost waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california nupon his arrival he is greeted by small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the forts personal emissary to the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met bottle of whiskey he did nt like reich neal mcdonough the nononsense soldier of the group and the seriously overmedicated cleaves david arquette cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions ninto this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers stranger colqhoun robert carlyle halfstarved scot who had been traveling with group of settlers until they became snowbound nseeking refuge in cave they soon ran out of food and were forced to consume one another ncolqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors doeuvre himself nour heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors and colqhoun tags along to help out nsoon it becomes clear that colqhouns tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive nit involves an old indian myth called weendigo which states that man who eats the flesh of another steals that persons strength spirit and very essence nhis hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes nthere can never be enough and death is the only escape nits all fairly sickening and you have to have healthy stomach to see the whole movie through nas professionally made as the movie is you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this nteenage horror fans wo nt care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell nolder folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually satire about the pioneer spirit but they ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces nbut jokes aside this is film that is well worth watching nit has wonderful and mature characters that few horror film can boast of and strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end nthe two main characters are also the most interesting nboyd is simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear nhis sacred wish is to live normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood ncolqhoun is different nhe proves that man on the brink of death would do anything to stay alive including sacrificing his own soul nhe believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically nit is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen nthe atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal ncompletely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer nhere time stands still and nothing changes nthe inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage nthey are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life nmen that are nothing and has nothing to loose nthe result is some sort of cabin fever ncannibalism is more like sick game for them nsince they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying nits like who going to die first nthe unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind does nt move the leaves on the trees resembles kubricks the shining nits hard to not get mad here none of the scary aspects of the film is strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters and starts to understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers nmusic is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere na strange musical score composed by michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast to the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation nthe director herself stated that it was ok to laugh during the picture nand must admit that it is often very funny in strange way such as the wonderful quote its nlonely being cannibal nyou do nt get that many friends nor when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat to live ndont live to eat but nmostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change nevery actor does great job nespecially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged by his undeserved honor nthis strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordans interview with the vampire nactually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies since the topics are so alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring nhowever these little failures do nt diminish the impression nthis is bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations nit is scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyones soul dark side which were all trying to hide but its there always nit is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining said no food ni did nt say there was nothing to eat colqhoun ravenous
bi can hear the question already nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common nto most people not lot except that both are by renowned directors nas saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers nbut oh how differently the packages affect their films nwhile everyones production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campions imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is ni left everyone says love you not remembering lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put grin on my face ni left the portrait of lady not remembering lot about who loved whom and could have cared less everyone features nothing allen has nt done before storywise nwoody is again desperately in love with beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut nhowever nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits nin fact in this movie the feeling itself is what most important nyes the movie would have been betteramong his very best thinkif it had meatier story nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling nand what better way to express feeling than through music nlove is often best expressed in song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart nsome are tad too goofy such as the number where lot of ghosts prance around in funeral parlor but admired allen for even putting them in there nit also helps that as usual allen has topflight cast working with him ntheir singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by professional nbut while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience ngranted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders njane campion too has topflight cast working for her in portrait of lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit visually interesting one ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind nunfortunately what did nt linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting ni remember very well shots of train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but can remember very little of what happened between all these people neven worse do nt find myself feeling bad that ve forgotten nthe problem think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material nit was the script that could nt convince me to care about anyone nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but found no reason to connect with any of them ni understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives njones script never simply gave me that opportunity nin the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes nunfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film nin the end the movies one strength ended up hurting it nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet was able to truly enjoy one of them nwhy nwith both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says love you was able to make my heart sing
bhistorical epic as genre was almost banished from hollywood in early nfor many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects nbut in same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre nand same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars nthe name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace nin his time english king edward longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights nalthough english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson does nt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack nmurrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country nthrough time more and more people join his ranks and in wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who would nt like to have simple commoner as national leader nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it would nt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann nhowever even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood ncompared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics nwhat makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as result character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero nwallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side nnaturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in nhowever even those who do nt particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her child nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes are nt as effective as they should be nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema nbrendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boormans general is also very good as wallaces trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol ndavid oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as onedimensional french princess ncatherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on nfrom the technical point of view the film is also very good nphotography by john toll brings lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen non the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank son prince edward played by peter hanly nhe is not only presented as villain but also as one of the less competent in villains camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood nto make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals nhowever although the message of this film might look rightwing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century naccording to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges nthis marxist

ba fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon nhunter thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas written in is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the but also because it ushered in new form of journalism known as gonzo nsoon after the book was written hunter thomspon became the basis for character in doonesbury known as uncle duke nand that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie nalthough the book is one of my favorites now agree with thompsons own assessment of the novel as unfilmable nthe main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and trippedout adventures was not written on the road nit was written and edited by hunter thomspons relatively sober at his home nso although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with sense of aloofness and some humor nhunter thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him nnot so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas ndespite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge nunfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depps who plays thompson excessive narration nand the characters while having vivid personalities are played as characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned nthe film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs nfrom there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards nwhile the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end ndespite lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground nthe set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination nhowever as we all know its not sets or effects that make movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good
bthe last steve martin film saw the spanish prisoner was very different approach for the comic actor nas millionaire leading massive conspiracy in order to rob process from clueless businessman martins character did it all for money nin his most recent movie bowfinger martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry nhe wants to direct successful picture that will force people to remember his name that will make him more popular at the parties and most importantly that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door nplaying the title role martin is once again the good guy the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie nthis con man is very likeable for some reason even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner nmaybe the message is that in hollywood to win over the trust and friendship of others you have to be little evil nbowfinger is very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars nmartin who also wrote the screenplay is perfect as jerk with conscience and eddie murphy does his best peter sellers in two different but equally hilarious roles one as big time move star and the other as his nerdy burger king employee brother nthe story follows aging and failing directorproducer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become respected member of his field by creating baction movie called chubby rain nin order to attract actors and crew members bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie nthe only problem is that kit refuses to be in it nbut this wo nt stop the aggressive bowfinger nhe is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him nhe has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with hidden camera filming the footage nwill bowfinger be able to make his film nor will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on nbowfinger is very cartoonlike movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding very solid story line nthe only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department nthis is the kind of movie that cameos are all about it is always funny to see actorsdirectorsproducers making fun of themselves or coworkers especially in playful movie such as this nbesides the very repetitive and superflous ending bowfinger is joy to watch nif you take movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it nif you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures the movie is great fun
bzero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we do nt understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film nzero is private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least he like to think so nhowever he socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as private eye even more bewildering than they already are nzeros accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller normal guy who does the business side of the job he the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soontobe client gregory stark ryan oneal nit turns out that stark has lost key to safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about nzero takes the case and the plot thickens nhis path leads to young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens ndespite her luminous and seeminglyharmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark nthrough his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in while film like chinatown comes long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness nzero effect which is jake kasdans first effort as writerdirector is film about private investigator that succeeds in all attempts its an original funny and completely involving motion picture nwith so many cliches available to this genre find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them nbut he did nt just successfully avoid flaws he has created great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment ntake for starters the great cast of characters npullman is terrific as zero showing comic flair that really have nt seen from him since spaceballs nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that he an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe npullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voiceover as he going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious nben stiller is also very funny individual he the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny ill shoot you he says to stark at one point have gun and everything nhis character is also welldrawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job noneal also gives his character bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film nkasdans humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialoguedriven though there are some great visual jokes nits the kind of humor that funny even after you ve seen it five or six times ntheres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such great detective nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular ni ca nt convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero nas side note do nt consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist find things funny that many do not and vice versa nthere was clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it ni have feeling the humor here wo nt appeal to everyone but there certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest njake kasdan son of writerdirector lawrence kasdan is only years old ni found this out after seeing the film and ca nt remember ever being so impressed with film maker nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed nzero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has heart and soul nat the end of the film was involved in the characters and was satisfied with the outcome nand with kasdans undeniable talent at such young age all can do is hope to see lot more from him in the future
bplot derek zoolander is male model nhe is also very dumb and impressionable nfor that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he does nt know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who wants to abolish child labor in his country nwill zoolander fulfill the dirty deed nwill zoolander ever grace the world his new look nis this funny movie nfind out below ncritique there place in our world for stupid comedies nfilms which do nt pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes ntheres also time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous nwell if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time nof course comedies as such are usually very subjective and could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead ni personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry nsnap nit was also nice to see several reallife models with small roles in the movie not taking themselves too seriously nand if you re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films well do nt look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others ni especially liked andy dicks complete makeover as the masseuse nhilarious nbut with all films of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply does nt work na few particulars which did nt strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the breakdance fighting and also never get why they use real countries in plots like this why not just make up country instead of zeroing in on certain people ni also could have done with less of the taylor character in general since she was nt all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then more zoolander dude nbut those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ni almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walkoff contest with david bowie as the judge no less and appreciated many of zoolanders moronic oneliners was merman nmerman nand dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie you re monkey derek nmonkey ni also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established nice rhythm to it all nagain its to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well nif you thought the trailer was dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something film from which there is an obvious influence here nblue steel baby yeah nwheres joblo coming from naustin powers austin powers deuce bigalow dude where my car freddy got fingered jay silent bob strike back joe dirt meet the parents say it is nt so
bone can not observe star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun nsometimes the stories are compelling nsometimes they re not nbut with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ve never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions nstar trek insurrection is no exception nthe film has gotten some negative reviews friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series but not really sure why nits an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film nsome say its bit too light and more of long episode than film nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring ni simply enjoyed the film ninsurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces us to race of people called the baku the baku are very old most of them are about three hundred years old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet nof course these peaceful people ca nt horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the sona led by ruafo nmurray abraham to mess everything up nthe sona who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying nthats when captain picard patrick stewart steps in he realizes that moving the baku would kill them it also helps that he falls in love with baku woman donna murphy nso with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat nwhen dealing with series with as much history as this its not entirely necessary to reintroduce your characters with each episode nthis is why believe nonfans have hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one has to understand how to approach it ninsurrection however does surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters nstewart is bold as always magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together njonathan frakes who also directed is funny as commander riker subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham makes perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effects and lot of good action nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scenes in which the sona employ giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet the special effects have clean impressively sharp look nif have any complaint about the film its that it tries to take moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so ni do nt think its that big of deal that the federation wanted to move baku in order to save the lives of thousands nbetter yet why could nt they have coexisted ninsurrection feels little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience nwith its inherent camp factor the star trek series does nt seem wellequipped to deal with issues like this ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle
bs would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept nin summer that high concept was mad bomber action thriller nin few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes nthe movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison nhe comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police nfew people except gaerity know the doves violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose ngaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at doves colleagues friends and relatives ndove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber nwhile speed does nt even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story nand that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed nbadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all nscreenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama nthe plot is of course full of implausibilities nthe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay nthose questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters nbecause of them movie seems little bit too long and boring at times nthe most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber nhis acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself nthis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive nthe film have few bright points though nsome of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night nand forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague nbut all in all blown away is film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor

bmovies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put lot of hard work in to script worth about ten cents nthe script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas he rehash lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drugdealing pirates to provide for few highlevel action sequences and explosions nthere are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make see the truman show for instance nsix days seven nights is simply waste nlets see nwe have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island nso how do we do that nwell well make her feisty magazine editor and well make him crusty old pilot nbut wait she has to have fianc that can be david schwimmer nbut wait if she has fianc how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ni know ntheyll get to their vacation spot and then shell get called back nyessssss nso they ll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes nshucks noh ve got it nwell throw in distracting subplot in which her fianc has sex with really attractive woman who acts like bimbo and then he can feel guilty nthen when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be vindicated action because her fianc will already have cheated on her nthen for no obvious reason they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them noh yes ni feel so good about this story ninstead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable nimagine that ndont get me wrong six days seven nights is not boring picture ford and heche both do great job nthe sparks fly between them and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and found myself laughing pretty hard nschwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get nand reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting neven though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences nits just when start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces nthe picture feels like its been hacked to pieces would nt be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely nthe ones that are here are as bad as they come think let out very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script nthe film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying nfor instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty nthis is serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford nin script that lacks even glimpse of intelligent subtlety find it odd that such strangely insulting device ended up in the story nthis is summer movie season but that does nt mean our movies have to be dumb so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters nwhen was in line for six days seven nights heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie why did nt she know the name of the film ni suppose she just did nt care what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures do nt realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves ngood actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that we like to spend our money on story worth more than ten cents
bit might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature film debut with blood simple grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas nit bears some resemblance storywise to the coens recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end nthe premise of blood simple is really just slight variation on the standard lovetrianglerevenge scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires shifty private detective nemmet walsh to kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much but what ensues is series of bloody and do mean bloody confrontations each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes but we the audience are made privy to the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person nthis aspect of the story along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other to death are the most effective components of the film nthe coens might have done well to title the film fear and loathing in texas nsome have labeled blood simple as modernday noir but while am not an expert on either genre it seems more like horror movie than anything else nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive nthat said blood simple is very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when murder attempt unfolds in way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film nthat said blood simple is not exactly flawless nfor one thing the motivations for the killings are still little thin at times can understand that the characters had tracks to cover or at least thought they did but found it little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder nand although they at least didn have anyone get hacked to death with knife the coens also are nt quite immune to horror cliches they indulge in prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutitsonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is but its decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in visceral but nonexploitative manner ni would firmly recommend it to all coenheads as well as anyone looking for something original in thriller
soldier by director paul anderson is film in which any presence of originality is fleeting nthe best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russels character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision nbrutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it little nthen it goes nowhere with that idea nthere is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ve ever seen nthe whole idea of the inhuman soldiertype character gaining some degree of humanity by defending potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and its been done much better ni was able to predict the plot of the whole story which would nt be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting nbetween the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited nhis performance in that way is nt all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film nother performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters nbut enough of this stuff about plot and character right nisnt the most important part of an action film well the action neven in this aspect the film is disappointment nin mortal kombat director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining nhowever he fails to repeat that in this film nthe combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve nfighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize nbut instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shootem up one guy vs an army type of cinema that thought died with the military action films of the nif the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been rather engaging science fiction film nhowever it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film big disappointment
bthe corruptor is big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence nits not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it does nt make shred of sense nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film njames foley knows lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like movie and more like derailed train nat least we have chow yunfat in the lead role nchow plays nick chen chinatown cop nhes good cop as the first few scenes establish and he very familiar with chinatown nthats probably why the powersthatbe decide to team him up with rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nnick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get chance to save the other ones life nwhat happens after that is kind of mystery to me nim fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann nim also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff nim not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way ntheres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox but it does nt have much to do with the main story none of the problems as said is that the movie does nt make any sense ni do nt blame this entirely on foley because he obviously good director nim more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script which does nt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act none scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because he angry about his new white partner nhes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and was thinking that would have fired him if he had done that to me in addition the film takes bite into racerelated issues and never develops them at all nthere are lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent ntheres also considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents nthe plot itself never straightens out nim not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as group nthe corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences nthe sequences are nt bad but they re not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen non that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen none too many imagine nfoleys strength is clearly in characterization and he does pretty good job here nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good and actually got feel for their characters bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together nchow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but he still fun to watch ni also liked the subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance is powerful and his character makes compelling moral compass for danny nbut the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes na complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when its over nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally there nothing left to hold on to
bokay let me first say this is beavis and butthead movie nif you do not like beavis and butthead do not go to see this movie nhowever if you do like them recommened you get out right now and go see it nthe movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv nthey notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it nthis wind their way through america searching for dallas she is woman nthey look for her because as they are searching for the tv they find drunk who wants them to do his wife nwell of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her nand the fun starts their nthis movie is mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off nit is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy ni enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace neven when they were crawling through the desert and thought the movie started to lag he manages to keep the laughs coming nif you expecting changes from the show keep looking nthe same character the same voices the same everything from the show and that what makes it good nyou might think with movie from tv show you can change few things noften times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place
bas the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother nyanking out his iv he uses it like water pistol to soak his brothers face nthis bit of lame physical humor is typical of disneys meet the deedles movie more to be endured that watched stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time did shed start sticking her finger in her throat nand she right it is that bad ndirected without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best nboyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts namazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have car go off the road five different times maybe more nbut who counting nand then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from decade ago was so awful that it is considered cult classic nmeet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad nit will probably be in and out of the theaters like tornado and is in no danger of becoming classic anything nherzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geysers geezer and like to put deedle in her haystack nas the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as walking kodak moment are celebrating their th birthday nas they ride parasail high above the waters of waikiki truant officer pursues them on his jet ski nas heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laidback beach bums into men nas they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone they ve got their surfboards skateboards and hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire ntheir camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers nthe rest of the movie has them fighting the parks overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as deranged exranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week nhopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being recent favorite does have propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material nthis is nt his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he ever been in nsteve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances nthe only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is cute little prairie dog named petey neven the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull nto add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate closeups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog nput tenfoot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said nalthough boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movies stunt of lying on your back on skateboard while negotiating busy and twisting mountain road nthey make it look like so much fun that sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil njust when you suspect it ca nt the movie takes turn further downhill nits low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag nafter phils girlfriend digs up big mount of moist soil they suck in long worm nlike the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in kiss nas they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested nmeet the deedles runs about an hour and half nit is rated pg for little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around and up nmy son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost gave the show nthey both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nnickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo
balchemy is steeped in shades of blue nkieslowskis blue that is nwith its examination of death isolation character restoration and recovery from loss suzanne myers new independent film echoes the polish directors internationallyacclaimed release nlanguage aside the principal difference between the films is that while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main characters world alchemy keeps its viewers at arms length nas result while were able to appreciate the films intellectual tapestry it is emotionally distant nalchemy is divided into three chapters charity faith and hope nwhile there are common themes and story elements running through all three the single constant is the main character sculptorrussian translator named louisa rya kihlstedt nwhen the film opens she living with her painter boyfriend whom she believes to be cheating on her nfollowing his sudden death in an automobile accident louisas life is thrown into turmoil nevents swirls around her and she ca nt find source of stability nin her quest to make sense out of her loss she befriends her late boyfriends mistress visits her ill sister and eventually abandons her old life by joining backto nature cult nalchemy successfully explores variety of compelling issues nin addition to asking the basic question of how person should cope with the unexpected death of loved one it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process the meaning of love and the nature of art ndoes personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar nare artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life with all of its various distractions to the fullest nmyers challenge is to make these subjects art film staples engrossing in new context nthrough louisas struggles she succeeds nwhile alchemy is nt always emotionally appealing it never loses its fascination neven when were not connecting with louisa who is often more of locus for ideas than fullydeveloped personality there enough material onscreen to hold our attention nthe cinematography is stunning ncity scenes are tinted with blue adding cold bleak dimension to the films early portions nlater when louisa reaches the wilderness were treated to dazzling array of autumnal splendor brightlycolored leaves in the trees and on the ground nits startlingbuteffective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisas life as she travels the road back to emotional stability nthe title refers to the practice of group of mystical faith healers who use alchemy to provide for the needs of the body and soul nand although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine its ultimately love and companionship not alchemy that brings solace nher pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is lifes ultimate goal neven though louisas final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been more vital character its still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch nalchemy is nt pure magic but especially during its best moments its close
bwalt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century foxs anastasia nbut judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about ndisneys recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and to lesser extent hercules nwith anastasia fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window nsome may say so what nits just kids movie nwell nif you have young kids beware as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of corpserotting rasputin zombie whose body parts continually fall off in disconcertingly real way nconsider yourselves warned nnevertheless the animation is quite stunning at times ndon bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout occasionally rivalling photographic quality nand yet in other scenes the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd which leads me to wonder nwas this rushed to market to combat disney nthe plot as anyone who had read history before knows concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in nnot that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened nas for the plot go rent disneys candleshoe nyoull see of anastasia there
byouve got to love disney nno matter what they serve up it is guaranteed success as long as its animated nkids have to go see the movie nthen they have to get the toys noh the video came out ngot to buy it or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of pilgrimage to mecca visit to the magic kingdom nstay at the disneyland hotel nbuy disney tshirt neat an ice cream mickey mouse on stick nits both vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it ndale carnegie should have had it so good nwhats most amazing is that all this success is in spite of severe lack of originality nyou see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot nthe theme changes with each new movie the plot does not nthe plot is mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same nhowever while the success of disney animated feature is generally given as far as boxoffice receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer nluckily disneys latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shanyu miguel ferrer nsoon chinas emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in chinas defense nwhen the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soontek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan mingna wen disguises herself as man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army nmulan based on chinese epic poem is classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling nmulan herself is disgrace to her loving family as she has difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role and in very amusing scene where matchmaker attempts to assess her value to potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points nvery early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to ones family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task nby leaving home to fight in her fathers place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too nas is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film nim not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time nboth lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salongas voice translates much better to animation nyou have to hear it to understand ninterestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan nthere is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie nit is however an expectation which has been built by disneys own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing nartistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as typically disneyfied ethnic tale nthere are also couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shanyus hun army which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it nwhen mulan resolves to take her fathers place she dons her fathers old battle armor and unsheathes sword nas she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal nit just left me thinking that was really cool na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soontek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao gruff pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance ni found the choice of nwong as shang little strange you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so guess anythings possible nin any event wong performs admirably as well none character which provides significant amount of humor is grandmother fa nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people njune foray who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice is venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha nmarni nixon who provides grandmother fas singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady nwith this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to little piece of history nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films nin an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles nin addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei ni guess clyde kusatsu was nt available nat running time of slightly under an hour and half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better
bfor those who associate italian cinema with fellini and high art the sons room is an inventive subtle alternative nwritten by directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement nslow is the best description for the film at first nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be normal happy family nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities nthey laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with sigh and soft pat on the shoulder nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome nbut suddenly the son is found to be dead after diving accident nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span nthough the film drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it does nt come across as vanity piece none might wish he had nt picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni which he stars as if only because this makes his characters reactions so predictable nwhat saves it is well written script with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of close relative or that remind depressed person of loss nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household nwhile giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is sense of being on autopilot nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more shell make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change nrespectfully gender issues never enter the picture nselfpropelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at party with friends there is never sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search to restore sense of balance to their lives nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing nin contrast the sons room captures more realistic depiction of the effects of death on family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters nits not the most engaging minutes but it is certainly easy to relate to

ni already had the female character picked out the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene but guess ill never know for sure what happened
bevery yearevery year at the festival wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars surprise ninto my bewildered visage nits almost always surprise nit sure as niflheim was this time namazing grace and chuck is being advertised as modern fairy tale of boy in montana who quits his little league team for very unusual reason nand in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get forced tear out of the eyes and boy wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash nanother nanother short circuit nthis film floored me for the simple reason that while it has fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an american folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time namerica has always had its mythical heros its paul bunyans and john waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar namazing grace and chuck is showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that its artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breezeor more importantly sharp thoughtwill shatter the wax facade of the panorama nthis is very sturdy scenario nthe principals are always given dialogue and always give performancesalways it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role nthe writerproducer david field seems to literally take all the yeah but in real life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in stronger way then before nastounding nhe uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it ni am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay its so very unusual especially in hollywood film ni do nt want to give too much away but the basic premise is that chuck joshua zuehlke the little league pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons nhis decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete boston basketball player alex english amazing grace smith and well leaving it at that because would nt spoil this film for you for the world nlet me just say this though am not recommending this film because think it has great message or because of any political positions it might imply ni do nt give rats ass for the political pointofview this film expresses one way or another recommending you go see this film because and only because its an excellent story told with excellence nno do nt believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc screw what think nthe point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream have ever seen on the movie screen nthis is the natural and moreall the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and much better script to boot nit carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhoodand more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of selfconsciousness nspecial kudos to both zuehlke reallife little league pitcher who was picked for the part and english forward for the denver nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters jamie lee curtis who takes surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazings manager and friend william peterson in big change from his role in to live and die in as father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave flag doing it and gregory peck as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is
bwow film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever nim amazed that someone thought this was story that must be told on screen nmany blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race ni think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sexcrazed buffoons neven offended by it nbill bellamy is player which means he sleeps with lot of women and lies to them nwhat pleasant main character none day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be player nwhy they decide this one day have no idea nhow many years have they been friends and why all of sudden would they want to learn nanyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women nthis is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car nsince russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jams how to be player was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy namazingly aside from gilbert gottfrieds seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such manner ninstead of jokes there just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts are nt so bad but naked breasts alone do nt make good movie nbe sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well ngilbert gottfrieds character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said nthey should have brought him along for the entire film nr

byou do nt need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is nwith few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is followup is nt the only reason its so miserable nits the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction nthe plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in soil sample back aboard their shuttle nthe slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black nthat should have been the end of the movie right there nback on terra firma at least one of the crew is now carrier of alien dna and as you ll remember if you saw the first movie driven by strong urge to procreate non parallel track government scientists have cloned version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing nthis apparently includes observing eves reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy neves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in grossout detail but otherwise there does nt appear to be whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract lets hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only neve finally breaks free of her confinesand her brafor the finale but the effects are so messy you ca nt really see what going on npeter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams told em not to go nat the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle nmichael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns ntheyre both unbelievably wooden nwhats talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe wonder nits an unfortunate trend this oncetalented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii nlast year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there nand the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects nis it just that there are no better offers out there species ii is worthless nworse than that its also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn nits not that there is nt anything positive to say about the film nthere is nafter minutes it ends

brobin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style noverwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber nso when the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know its in trouble njakob the liar is confused muddled little movie generically uplifting film with fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie does nt realize it nwilliams plays jakob haim jew imprisoned in polish ghetto during world war ii none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of highranking german officer for his punishment njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately seconds of radio broadcast nthe announcement in english but punctuated by triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakobs ghetto nliberation he thinks nthe next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along nsoon it is common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has radio hidden in his home crime punishable by death nthis is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate nthe danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger nin curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear nhe and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations are nt met the results are far worse than if there was no hope nthats the films biggest detriment it is based on false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false nits never moving because it does nt give us anything to be moved by njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing nrobin williams does nt inject the film with life as matter of fact he seems little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent nhe is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this is nt the robin williams we know and love nin good will hunting he became serious actor and won an oscar for it nhere he is more of wannabe serious actor an impostor njakob the liar will be compared with last years life is beautiful because it is being marketed as holocaust comedy nits not comedy nit tries sometimes but it rarely works nis it melodrama na war movie na character study nno no and no njakob the liar is the kind of movie that ca nt be placed into category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts
blook the new version of psycho came out and the world did nt end ni guess gus van sant really is nt the bringer of the apocalypse nunfortunately though that psycho did nt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it nvan sants controversial retelling of alfred hitchcocks classic film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered nwithout benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck nbeing an almost good critic waited until actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that am braindead orangutan ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shotforshot using the same exact script with few minor alterations nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original nsadly that did not occur nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen nin moores case the film would have been helped if the files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing scully impression nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming sentence moore is scully nmortensen who liked in njane opts to play sam loomis as cowboyhick which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point nsam has twang and cowboy hat but that about it nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory nanne heche in the janet leigh role does few good things in her brief time on screen nat least her marion crane has little life in her which ca nt be said for most of the rest of the cast nthe best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mamas boy norman bates nhes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk nthere is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film nvan sant has made boring film nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in are nt as eyecatching now nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they do nt impress or excite nvan sant in what assume is grasp at originality decided to put some streamofconsciousness images into few famous scenes was that lamb in the middle of the road nthese images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter ndefinitely not hitchcocks intention nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score nif film like psycho does not frighten then what the point naside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience nthere are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting nin the end however the new psycho is noble attempt but alas dismal failure
bif there one thing just ca nt stand its film that oozes with sentimentality nheres note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves nswelling saddening music is not good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless nalas my giant is film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that forgot as watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up nwhat reminded me was that was nt choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter nmy giant is forced contrived and conspicuously uncute detest the word cute but ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create cute film here nit takes premise that might have been interesting liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience nmaybe it will work for some people nit did nt work for me nbilly crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania nhes in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing film nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall nhis name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks he be great movie star because of his size nsubplots are as follows sam has son and wife kathleen quinlan and he never around for them so they move to chicago nmax is in love with woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved nsam is broke nmax is dying npass the kleenex nmy giant as comedy is only moderately funny nit has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself nin one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son does nt believe that he actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is would quote the line like but it would probably lose its effect ncrystal is always entertaining and he has few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however he countered by slew of jokes that are nt funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes nmuresan is kind of fun to watch but he just ca nt act very well nquinlan on the other hand is great actress who needs to get role that shows off her talents nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff nhere the best thing she gets to do is fake romanian accent nall of these disappointing ingredients create film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings nsams multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about main character who has healthy relationship with his family nlater it turns out the entire story is supposed to be great big metaphor signifying sams reunion with his family nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is valiant thing but had few morality problems with it and apologize for being vague nits icky nit drips with gooey wannabe human emotions nmy giant could have been straightforward and funny family film nmore importantly it could have been moving on level far deeper than it is ninstead its complicated overlong and underengaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world
bcapsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie nthe gags are sporadically funny nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes nthe plot is weak and the leads are not particularly funny comic team nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low to na film needs plot nit needs characters for empathy value nit needs story and an emotional center nif film is just chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy nwith dogma he tried to make philosophical religious comedy and mixed with madcap romp npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it nhis remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at teenage audience njay and silent bob strike back is compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and injokes nhow funny the jokes are will be subjective call nfor me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny nthere was not enough cleverness or variety nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay npenis jokes work only so many times nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were clever pair of human running gags nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation stoners nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads njay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks nthis leaves them at loose ends nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into movie nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny nsilent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than straight man like dean martin or bud abbott would have njay has to be the comic nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair nso jay and silent bob are long way from being successful comic team ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before nlike dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than real movie ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving nthey are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience ni rate it on the to scale and low on the to scale

bthe working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been more apt name for motion picture neven though this movie clocks in at relatively skinny minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics nwriterdirector edward burns has trotted out hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has nt spent their life in seclusion ninstead of tweaking the formula little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way nno looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful nthe most appropriate ending would have been triple suicide and the sooner the better nalas that not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio nand to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in gray new york state beach town npeeks of sunshine are few and far between nno wonder the characters are all so miserable nfirst of all we have charlie burns generation slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home nthat girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlies departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlies old school buddies mike jon bon jovi nthe two have comfortable relationship but its apparent to even blind person that they re not right for each other nclaudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children nthen charlie reenters the mix nso who if anyone will claudia end up with nwho cares nno looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that were not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle nso what if no one finds happiness these characters do nt deserve it anyway especially after wasting minutes of our time nthey are nt real people they re writers construct stumbling through tooobvious storyline nthey should know the ending as well as we do nand burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with plot that at least offered surprise or two nanother frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with group of potentiallyinteresting supporting characters nblythe danner is solid as claudias housebound mother connie britton is suitably highstrung as claudias neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eyecatching as bartender in search of little romance nsadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell nnone of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes nedward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here njon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from singer branching into different career but he could still use little polish nthe worst case is lauren holly who presents completely bland claudia nas portrayed here she hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even moments interest not to mention undying love nburns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hardpressed to do less inspired job nwhen he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging actordirector executive produced this mess ntwo films and three short years later the luster has faded nsome movie makers have only one good film in them nwith back toback duds like she the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like member of that undistinguished club
bdavid lynchs blue velvet begins and ends with colorful bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in seemingly perfect american town nhowever what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is strange world of drug dealers sadists and murderers nthe opening and closing shots are wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy disturbing film nthey show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances nodd would be perfect adjective to describe this film its characters its direction and its story nthankfully the obscurity that blue velvet relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable nsince its elements are so originally weird you never know what will happen next nthis is the main goal of movie to be spontaneous and surprising blue velvet miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting nlynch creates such hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling nthe film starts off with the discovery of severed ear by college boy kyle maclachlan nfrom this point maclachlan finds himself involved with lounge singer isabella rossellinia who has lost her son and husband to kidnapping nthe plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynchs story telling so amazing nmaclachlan becomes involved in forbidden relationship in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of high school flick and he is put into the shoes of drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends nthrough these multiple stories maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan we are introduced to variety of interesting subplots nlynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make convenient crowd pleasing conclusion ninstead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times nlynch has been known to do this with number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine nhowever for fans of odd difficult indies blue velvet could be just what they are looking for nit is very hard to discuss blue velvet without discussing the performance of dennis hoppers sadistic frank nmost of the other actors in the film were not very memorable nkyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role personality nlaura dern was consistently annoying nbut dennis hopper stole every scene he was in nhis evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from gas mask nfrank is character that comes along once in blue moon nmany producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy njust like his villain in speed hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak nthis harshness is exactly what frank is so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him even if he theatens you to look away blue velvet has characters and stories you will never see in movie again nfor this sole reason it is recommended nbut also see it to admire lynchs obsession to avoid the norm neven if this film is little too weird for you its hard not to congratulate guy for trying something new and sticking to it

bmodern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the popbroadway musical rather than victor hugos original tome nadapted several times for the cinema this latest effort does superb job of translating the characters story and heart of the novel to the screen nliam neeson stars as jean valjean nas young man valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger and he was sentenced to years of hard labor for his crimes nprison hardened him and on his release he seems doomed to life of crime and squalor nhowever an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life and he vows to become better man nhowever he runs up against one man who does nt believe in reform ninspector javert geoffrey rush is an obsessive law abider nhe has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules even with benign intentions nhe once served as guard at the labor camp where valjean served and after valjean breaks his parole javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice ntwo women also get caught up in the struggle nfantine uma thurman is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society nher daughter cosette mimi newman and later claire danes is her life yet she can not afford to raise her ninstead cosette is sent to live with cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine and forces cosette into life little better than slave ndirector bille august manages to create faithful adaptation of victor hugos novel which though omitting some of the political undertones remains true to the overall story and tone of the book nhopefully you wo nt as some clueless members of the audience did wonder where all the songs went nthe movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes nthe experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles nneeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of man trying to do good but continually haunted by his past nthe supporting cast is also extraordinary nthe only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson playing the revolutionary marius nthe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair but it is transitory and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film nthe novel les misirables is by any account an epic both in its scope and in its length nwhile it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into two hour movie this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation nit too is an epic and one worth seeing

bthe skulls is laughably bad thriller teenorientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into hypnotic stupor ncertain moments are so preposterous that nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter ni chuckled incessantly all the way home nlet me share nthe skulls is secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college nluke mcnamara joshua jackson townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report ndespite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization nsoon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving new car and marveling at the that somehow surfaced in his bank account nyeah dude pretty good deal eh nbut luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as drooling vegetable nthe premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense nunfortunately the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting nits just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars nbut not the script nthe skulls is so bad it attains certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for slew of unintentional howlers nfirst off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have skull branded onto their arm nafterward they are supplied with wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar nwill they never take this watch off nand what if they forget it by their bedside nperhaps their secret society was being little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed non top of this they are each given rulebook and key to headquarters ngee why not member tshirts nbut my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions nthey are given official skull paddles nwhen flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal nfacing the opposite way means disagreement nwouldnt they merely express themselves verbally nhell no nthey have to retrieve the paddles for proper vote and maybe afterward they can play pingpong nim still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest nthe cast meanwhile combines pinch of veteran talent with dash of the dawsons creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be mutually shared union throughout nbut not entirely naccomplished actors like craig nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them nand then there christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be fun exciting actor nmcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it hattrick ni pray it was snatchthepaycheckandrun exercise for all these actors nthe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better nlets cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character npaul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judges son nwalker preserves straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad just killed guy in the ritual room nsome actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays lukes longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics nit really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one nor maybe not minute one thanks to decent setup from director rob cohen who films early sequences with sense of atmosphere and style nit makes you wonder why he did nt flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight are nt superior cinema they belong on the afi top list when compared to this degrading trash naside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skulls gets little accomplished nthe thrills and action are lazy and mechanical nthe story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of secret underground society flick ninstead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage nweve seen it all before and better nthe skulls is feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as clever pun term like boneheaded seems just too generous
bwarren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest craziest and hard hitting movie in his career nbased on story concocted by himself and also written by beatty bulworth gives good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system nbeatty stars as senator jay bulworth who going through nervous breakdown nafter hiring someone to kill him he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what really happening in american politics much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy platt ninstead of everyone hating him the american public love him nhowever inside his party more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin nand he also strikes relationship with black girl nina berry nits remarkable that this film was released at all nmuch more open than the rather subdued primary colours bulworth barely gives the american politic system good name nthe outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny and also somewhat true nits great that beatty is nt afraid to let loose on subject ntalking of beatty he excellent in the role of the demented senator clearing having fun nand seeing warren beatty have fun is rare sight indeed neven in dick tracy he was the most straighten face actor then again he was the only characters face we could completely see nthe film gives an opportunity for the year old beatty to indulge in some rapping which he does with gusto and also quite well nand seeing beatty as homeboy has to be seen to be believed nits nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself nsecond best is oliver platt as the flustered coke snorting assistant who goes over the top when he finally snaps nhalle berry is fine and sexy as the intellectual nina who comes to like the senator nalso popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit strange accent laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she also played and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife who all contribute to the fun nand this being political film the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance as shock himself nthe writing and directing both by beatty are above par nthe direction is very nearly sitcom like but suits the film perfectly and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well nthe script is funny and the raps are actually well produced and humorous and quite clever ntheyre not cringe inducing at least nthe script makes many points about society in america today and is nt afraid to make any bold statements about what is flawed system nbest of all the film is thought provoking but directed and written in such way that the film feels as light as feather and is very entertaining ntheres also great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes nbulworth is film with many advantages and few flaws nperhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see year old man rapping but beatty does it so well its irrelevant nin fact there very little against bulworth except for the language which is very heavy but then again it should be expected nbulworth then is well worth watching na david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes
bthe andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made ni know that is very sweeping statement so ill qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot space odyssey is probably better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be science nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in futuristic setting nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in hightech for van looking for crashed satellite in tiny new mexico town nsomething bad happens to them npictures from reconnaissance plane show shocking sight napparently everyone in the town is dead nthe authorities call wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant to supersecret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada ntwo of scientists stone and hall fly directly to the town in space suits and find town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned to powder in their veins nsome went insane before they died and two of them baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab where stone pressures the white house to call up directive an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with nuclear bomb nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earthlike life and mutates as it grows ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the abomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet nthey barely call off the bombing in time nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out nthis triggers the labs lastditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow nmuch of the film is lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw nthe performances are universally fine with the actors keeping things lowkey and restrained just like scientists nto me the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in way we do nt expect nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it nit was originally rated when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which bodys wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood
bwith the opening scene of young couple in van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll actually its lock and load you ca nt help thinking tarantino nand of course with its storyline of crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon inspired by true events we ve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated nor so strangely poignant nfor this is story of real people whose lives take on steadily unreal quality who in their search for normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged nbeginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry policeman and pam ashley judd factory worker nthey fall in love and marry but pams increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris nwhen chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up nthen chris begins to rob banks nluke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills or buffy the vampire slayer nmoustached with tough paternal look and yet voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband its another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into fascinating yet often infuriating person nif the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually staple of cinema whether its in betty blue tom viv or georgia nas in those movies there the danger that the performance seems mannered collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece njudd does nt entirely avoid this pitfall but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris nwhen pam reacts to her fatherinlaws death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint nof course its the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity nit is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me nwere real family she notes wryly nit is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such successful bank robber his wellplanned disguise as bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery huge sign on shopping mall stands out in the background buymore the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations nits not perfect film nsome of the dialogue is touch too banal perhaps intentionally nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film nindeed as in mcnaughtons seminal film henry portrait of serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths nmcnaughton has filmed this story with quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer nthe suburbs with their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls take on sense of claustrophobic blankness nin its very different way this makes for as haunting backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies nbut these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world npams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement nthe flying inkpots rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection nsee it twice

bthe lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is fascinating topic nfinding an allstar cast for such film is stroke of genius ncombining all that with threetime oscarwinning director robert benton of kramer vs nkramer and creating decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood how many of these have we seen during the past few years the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere nover harry ross paul newman is washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life nhes screwed up things pretty well had wife and daughter nnow drunk and is at crossroads na couple of years ago he traveled to mexico to bring back mel reese witherspoon the underage daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives with them nthe ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up nto fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine njack is in even worse shape than harry nhes dying of cancer with only year to live nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off sealed manila envelope for him ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is himself full of bloody holes nthis unsettling event gives the former detective project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband years before nthrough series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer rosss former cop buddies exlover and wouldbe sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to nits film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario nby the time they show you it does nt matter nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship with rubin giancarlo esposito partner wannabe nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief however they are neither nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either its not explained or did nt care enough at that point to remember na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform nits also not funny does nt connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course non the positive side its often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen nthe three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs nnewman is grand actor but does nt seem quite suited to the dark film style nhe is bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out nhackman also lowkey is believable but lacks sparkle nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog but they ca nt pull the film out of the hole its dug for itself njames garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always treat but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like glad they did nt shoot your pecker off nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen nthe film does nt run very long before the audience realizes that its hopeless nthe only reason for watching is the actors nit reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the films problems nin better world there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better nof course we do nt live in that better world but you could make yours little nicer by choosing different movie
bthe original babe was my favorite movie of sleeper hit that transcended its target audience nbeing surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tieins which limited its final take nthus babe arrives with budget greater than the money made in babe nplush dolls vending machines hawking tshirts and macys thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday moneygrubbing ntoo late nthis is sad review to write because babe not only does not live up to the original but it does nt even come to fraction of it ni should nt expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm nconsider driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral nimagine with me if you will screams jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe there must be more talking animals there must be more slapstick comedy there must be more songs for those mice to sing that cute keep the story cards to break up the action that cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baaramewe secret code the that ll do pig nthatll do nnow throw in the limitations james cromwell now hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he did nt approve of the script christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money paltry considering the million budget nout ne ndaily comes in with noticable results george miller the director is more wellknown for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he did nt direct that andre film in the special effects are impressive but limited nbabe talks but most of the time from single shot repeated over and over again babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with happy smirkregardless of whether he happy or scared or tired nseason now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwritingishell bin change the venue into the big city nthis has been praised as wildly original nexcuse me did nt home alone do this several years ago nhow about the muppets neven the bad news bears travelled to tokyo nsorry nno dice nside note to give the city fairytale look george miller crafted fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the worlds great cities and yes it is impressive nbut this too is overused repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions nand for the most part babe remains in the hotel ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski nstretch nshes not lead actresstype she not funny enough in her physical comedy and she simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls have her arrested falsely on drug charges nhave her accidentally incite riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes nhave her bounce around on bungee cord at prestigious benefit dinner ni was hoping for little smirk during these scenes but felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in ni am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater neven the best fairy tales have bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated nno my problem is with the story or lack thereof nbabe is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten nbeing goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually do nwithout giving the ending away the farm is saved from leftfield quirk that had nothing to do with the pig nspeaking of pig or pigpigpigpigpig nthe word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino could have been watching scarface nthis is screenwriting nfurther can not explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups nhad it been cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened nbut to farmer hoggett nhis wife nan elderly mickey rooney nmuch too irreverent quick nsplice those singing mice into those scenes nthe film is nt colossal failure ni did like glenne headleys schmoozy chimpanzee ni liked the pink poodle nthe dog on the cart who momentarily thinks he in dog heaven nand weird looking guy who may have been doublycast as an airport employee and judge nbut most of the time was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hackedup script nthem singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for story nlet me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says that ll do pig nthatll do nthats it nhope did nt ruin it for you nbut tell me this what the heck did that pig do

bjack nicholson has funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway nin as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall successful novelist with obsessivecompulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible except when he feels like being royal pain in the youknowwhere nhes mean ni mean really mean nthe opening scene shows him shoving little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium nevery day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served by the same waitress nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe none day melvin makes comment that goes to far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like ton of bricks nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as matter of course but is also the only person who can get to him too nanother person who often crosses melvins sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvins floor naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him prime target nsimons friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better nwhen simon walks in on pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simons dog while he convalesces nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets to like the dog and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvins softening up to the world around him nit does nt happen overnight but throughout the film he bites his tongue here cares little there and most miraculously falls in love none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others nhes traveling terra incognita here and it shows ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film especially by nicholson and hunt nthey play well off of each other and have genuine chemistry which makes it pleasure to watch them on screen ngreg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting film roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon nhe gives short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels ncuba gooding jr performs with hypedup level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear and comes through with near constant comic performance nthe screenplay by mark andrus and james brooks is clever touching and funny nthe best part about it however is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting nmelvin is man we ca nt quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention ncarol is working woman living with her mother trying to take care of child with debilitating respiratory problem nsimon is man who is success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted by much of society ncombined with the talent of the actors these characters make the film nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary but the film ends before his return leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general in addition to part in the films conclusion ntheres one actor who will probably not be recognized by any awards but who contributes greatly to many of the movies best scenes and who deserves mention nthis is that little dog nhe plays such pivotal role to melvins character development actually serves to forward the plot and has some absolutely scenestealing moments that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal naward or no however when even the dog puts in good performance you know you ve got an outstanding movie
bthe laserman somehow the title of writerdirectorproducer peter wangs film conjures up images of superheroes like ultraman and spiderman nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips nas it turns out the laserman is about crime and about laser beams but there are nt any superheroes ninstead wangs film is populated by group of refreshingly offbeat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot new york city nthe laserman is comic brew which celebrates ethnicity eccentricity and electricity nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss marc hayashi chineseamerican laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment nhe loses his job but finds work with mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds narthurs professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas nhis personal life on the other hand is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives nin fact arthur is by far the blandest character in the film despite charismatic performance by hayashi the san franciscobased actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii nits the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark narthurs notsotypical jewish mother ruth for example is convinced that chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body nshe has dyed her red hair black she takes herbal medicine daily and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies such as matzo balls in soy saucethe ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it almost stealing the movie in the process nshe plays ruth as driven woman determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture narthurs girlfriend janet maryann urbano is kooky freespirit who would rather meditate than copulate her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation narthurs best friend joey tony leung is small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns njoey is married to arthurs jewish sister but he is also having an affair with chinese immigrant who works in whore house narthurs yearold son jimmy played by the amazingly adorable david chan ishorror of horrorsbad at math nhe finds it impossible to meet his fathers lofty expectations nthe various people in arthurs life come together to form rich tapestry of humanity nlike wangs earlier film great wall about san francisco family visiting relatives in china the laserman revolves around cultural differences nevery character in the film is in some way or another trying to find his identitystruggling to negotiate balance between his native culture and the american way nthe movie also offers provocative look at technology nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu detective who is fed up with machines even though he relies on them to do his job nthe film views technology with wary eye acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers nwang raises the timehonored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions nwas einstein responsible for the abomb nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers nthe movie pits spirituality against technology man against machine and the result is draw naccording to the film technology has its place but we must employ it with great forethought and caution nironically by its very nature the laserman is triumph of technologythe technology of filmmaking nwangs direction is exquisite especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically crosscuts between the various subplots perhaps in homage to ngriffith ncinematographer ernest dickerson who has worked on all of spike lees films gives the laserman distinctive artistic look nmason darings score which includes sendup of bach is right on target nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor which is to be applauded but its sometimes ambitious to fault nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that its hard to digest them all nfor instance one character arthurs sister has negligible screen time and consequently we just do nt care about her marital problems nin weaving his web wang has included few too many strands noverall however the laserman is charmingly eclectic concoction non the surface the film is light and bouncy comedythriller overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take deeper look at the film nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town
bwhen first saw the preview for cruel intentions turned to my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears masterpiece nimagine my surprise to see that writerdirector roger kumble has given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits nand was impressed nin fact was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for movie nits kiddieporn hackwork complete with earthy sextalk and fullyclothed handjobs ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out there was certainly room for pretentious and laughable movie about bunch of teenagers who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined ncruel intentions is mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way expected it to hated all the characters and hate everything they do ni also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be nphillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont nwow nisnt that memorable name ni could just say it over and over again nsebastian valmont nit kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he ca nt have no material object out of his reach nhe has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips nand luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults do nt really exist nthe ones who do are irritating nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitchqueen of the universe and also the woman every man wants nsince these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to devirginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dorkchick who has somehow wronged kathryn nbut its too easy for sebastian valmont he wants to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty nso sebastian valmont and kathryn make deal which is too explicit to state here nbut dear god sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove ndangerous liaisons is great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting nkathryn merteuil is simply hateful witch girl so loathsome that would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her nshe is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons ngellar while aesthetically pleasing is onedimensional and utterly repulsive nwitherspoon has truly beautiful face but her character is nt the moral staple she supposed to be sure she wo nt have sex until she in love is this really moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than little reprehensible nbut ca nt forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness ni have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions nand there one point in the film in which he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone ntrue he is bad but it does nt help that he has no character to work with nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us with sexcrazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch nthe film fails in every other way too nfirst of all nobody talks like this neven the intellectuals know do nt bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering nfor while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there no way we can join it ncruel intentions also manages to come off as softporn in more than one scene nearlier mentioned fullyclothed handjob this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie nso if we hate them then what the point of an extended sex scene ntitillation of course nit ca nt even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters nits interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scenes have similar tone and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in which spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers nbut kids do nt act like this nnobody acts like this nin his translation roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy some pretty crucial elements nthe result is picture of confounding badness kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound nill give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences but that does nt change the fact that its awful
bthe makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation batman and robin nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations nin panelsized morsels implausible plots and rambo esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons white who is framed by corporate baddie played without irony by sheen then set on fire and left for dead nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points heres what could determine said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army under the tutelage of flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating as always nhe is renamed for reasons unbeknownst spawn and granted really cool costume that enables him to become something of human chameleon nbut when spawn spies on birthday party for his child he realizes that he ca nt be the evil superdemon he expected to be and he sets about avenging his untimely death ntypical of summer blockbusters spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion spawn longs for his wife but they do nt have single scene together before simmons death conflict who will triumph is not anybodys guess and believability not that expected it nso many questions are left unanswered and sure they wo nt be addressed in the inevitable sequel nwhile last years the crow city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative which was lazy and somewhat incoherent it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power nspawn is an inyourface screaming banshee of film these guys know how to graft comic book onto celluloid but they have nt the faintest idea how to make movie

bi know it already opened in december but finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend and it was one of those rare oppritunites that got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price nas the final scene closed out in happy slowmo fashion felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such good display of filmmaking njason schwartzman his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses steals the show as max fischer the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades but compensates for it by organizing most of the schools clubs and organizations nthe fencing team and writing and producing school plays and often pulling outrageous stunts one that eventually earns him an expulsion nthis stunt building an aquarium on the schools baseball diamond is plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross olivia williams nhe funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume very oscarworthy bill murray who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross nrosemary and herman begin datingand the fun begins herman and max go at it head to head in battle for miss cross nherman manages to destroy maxs bike while max cuts hermans brakes and it goes on like this nbut eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross and he ca nt stand in the way of two people in love nthe academy of arts sciences really messed up this year they completely overlooked rushmore and if you ask me it was nt an accident nit maybe was nt best picture material but it certainly deserved screenplay nod instead of elizabeth and bill murrays absense from the ballot is complete snub nthe entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good at one point its fun and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic nthe cinematography gives the movie an important feeling as well ni hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers

bclint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another nmidnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwooddirected film clint is nt even in and its damn good nadapted from bestselling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head nand that just the mayor nas director and producer eastwood contributes self indulgent but very competent minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor nlike all great movies midnight in the garden has lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion nthe acting from bigtime stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as you expect but its the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm ncusack plays freelance reporter sent to savannah to write fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spaceys parties nlots of food beverages and gunplay nyes an employee of spaceys has huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead nit seems like simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being movie there much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write book about the murder book which will eventually become movie he will star in nthe weird circle of entertainment nthis is where the stable of supporting characters comes in ntheres the requisite sexy woman alison nepotists daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite nmiss chablis deserves paragraph of hisher own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony nchablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movies comic relief or out of place in basically serious movie nthere are also fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating ncertainly the characterizations of the judge and spaceys lawyer both help immensely as does having the flyguy as the jurys foreman nits here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spaceys homosexuality nyes spacey had sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course nmidnight in the garden of good and evil is nt classic but it is one of the better celebritydirected truestory bestseller adaptations out there nlikewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great nin fact almost recommend that the academy add best supporting transvestite category nserving america for more than th of century
bdeadbang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it nalthough deadbang is definitely dead it is anything but bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore nin the film johnson plays nyou guessed it na cop nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is gritty los angeles homicide detective real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice na la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and bleak outlook on life nbecks wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children nshe will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone nbut becks family and emotional problems take back seat to the action and thrills in deadbang nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of shopkeeper and cop nhis investigation starts in and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has violent showdown with the killers at white supremacist camp nvirtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes nthe movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions nthe action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense ni certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii nin all fairness to frankenheimer however should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction ndeadbang tries to don mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting naccording to the movies production notes deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck nyou would never guess this from watching deadbang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable nmost of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above nwilliam forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler wholesome bythebook fbi agent who offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods nforsythes lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable ndeadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and franks place but his talents are completely wasted in cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains nthe sole function of penelope ann millers character is to give deadbang an excuse to include gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less ni guess the films title refers to this love scene since its definitely dead bang nthe only real virtue of deadbang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script njohnson succeeds in giving his character sarcastic sense of humor and hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life nand must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments nthe funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over criminal as he interrogates him nbut when barf is the highlight of movie you know the movies in trouble nthe other amusing scene involves psychological examination of beck in which he ca nt keep straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen nbut two funny scenes and couple good wisecracks do not movie make
bit is always refreshing to see superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for living to want to take chance and play lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback nof course if was being paid million for one months work probably be willing to take risks as well but that neither here nor there npayback is based on novel by richard stark apparently actually donald westlake author of the grifters itself fine crime film which was also filmed in the as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we do nt know yet nall we know is that gibson as porter is nt happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences nit turns out that the man he after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole briefcase full of cash from gang of chinese mobsters nobviously not having much of crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off debt to his employers nporter however is the sort of man who holds grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val ngibson gives terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of slightly unhinged guy who does nt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants nyou probably would nt see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat outofcharacter role such as porter jim carrey wo nt be doing anything like this in hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone nharrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played villain was batman and robin which we wo nt mention further and has stallone ever really played villain at all nthis is not to say that porter is villain per se nwhile he is nt the sort of character you would nt want to get on the wrong side of he nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just to prove how mean they are nporter is only trying to get back what is notsorightfully his which in way is almost understandable npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller which wo nt be remembered as being among gibsons most important work but is still one of the finer films he done nthe only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end was left feeling something was lacking was that all nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voiceover does nt ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the film embodies nthe film just ends far too suddenly after huge buildup in the penultimate scenes na fine film even though it needs just little something more to be the kind of film that can be recommended without hesitation njust be ready for possible letdown of an ending
bjohn carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has its good side and its bad nits held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that pretty satisfying njames woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie nthe good side some neat scenes of vampires and violence nthe bad no scares nyes that right even though being directed by one of horrors most cherished directors vampires is the least bit scary if not at all njames woods stars as jack vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the master vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight ndaniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya wisecracking guy who really is nt that funny nin the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy nof course we all know sunshine kills vampires and that is just how they kill these vampires hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death nafter throwing party for what happened the vampires that did not die come back to trash it nthey kill almost all of jacks team leaving only few alive nsheryl lee plays prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek but not yet turned into vampire nshe is rescued by jack and flees with them on their search for valek nthey have to fight they re way against vampires leading up to finale that is welldone with great special effects nvampires definately could have been done better nthe makeup special effects and story are first rate but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had nit to me had more humor than horror almost being compared to fright night with the mix of violence and comedy njohn carpenter does great job of directing this film nhe eases through some tough times and saves the flaws which are noticeable but forgettable nthe script is clever and funny with many lines that make us laugh out loud ni much enjoyed vampires with few exceptions nits one of those films you see but do nt take to heart nyou enjoy the time you spent and go on nthe recently released psycho is the same way its not as good as you hope but it is fun and entertaining nvampires is good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer

bwhen was asked to see this movie with friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant ni was perhaps wrong to be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation with street hooker just could not picture him in any romantic lead nwhat makes this movie wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries with it brilliantly written script nthis writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is master in the domain of the romantic comedy with splashes of drama thrown in between nhugh and his hair is almost identical to the character that made him famous in four weddings nhe plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck nunfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie nif only he would dither little less njulia knows this role well nthe glamorous movie star who is searching for true love nthere are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness nhow sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful but to have no one to share it with nthe writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels nhow differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such harsh environment nhow the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice
bwhen pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart it could mean one of two things that the recently overworked individual is due for welldeserved rest or that either of these movies has been sitting in studio safe for while and the timing is merely coincidence nthe latters the case with john mctiernan and the thirteenth warrior which finally hits theatres year and counting after its original spring opening and fast on the heels of mctiernans the thomas crown affair remake flick that got good reviews nyou do nt have to believe superstitions to wager guess that thirteenth wo nt be so lucky nreportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton whose eaters of the dead novel provides warrior source and its initial title this messy melange of cultureclash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish sorta like braveheart without any of the passion nbut the bloodshed certainly remains there enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness nthese circath century clashes involve roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside nthe good guys are loud crude often unintelligible and judging from their highly icky hygiene habits pretty smelly to boot which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador antonio banderas who tags along quite reluctantly ntheyre also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when few of them meet violent demises nyoull wince you ll groan you ll grouse have nt we seen this guy killed twice before nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos partaking mostly from distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animalskin fashion run amok nhes not the hero his soulful eyes and lean build do nt exactly herald champion of shwarzenegger proportions and the thirteenth warrior wisely does nt pretend he is allowing his foreign and physically imposing costars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields however and there still struggle for the audience to follow or even care about the story nit is nt the end until audiences have witnessed halfbaked romance murky political intrigue veteran actor omar sharif funny girl dropping by in cameo role and climactic indiana jones and the temple of doom esque chase through the villains underground lair nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr but the collaboration between die hard helmer mctiernan and jurrasic park creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights graphic action and unintentionally telling moments nheard during the thirteenth warrior final scene dog whimpering nhow appropriate
boften similar to little boy lost in park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe toque do oboe is disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray nmany elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply do nt convert into solid work nalthough setting is never established it becomes apparent nthe film takes place somewhere in latin american village in present day nthe community is dull one where every day is downhill slide from the last nover time the people have taken to themselves nthe town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger nso what happens when tourist paolo betti does arrive one day nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock nit is revealed that he is musician who plays the oboe as hobby nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the towns police inspector figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement with this musician nthe rest of the plot closely resembles freak show gone horribly astray nit features character who literally rises from his grave woman who has phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk ntechnically this film is nightmare nthe music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt nthe lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than words nin addition the pace of the film seems uneven nit opens with series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience nthe film then moves into faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark nthere was however potential for this film nit is piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the reunification of people nthese are all topics that could easily fill movie nperhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be thing of beauty at the end nmost importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours are nt such bore nuntil then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in park
bfor his directoral debut gary oldman chose highly personal family drama about violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects nbut while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars nthen he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing nraymond then proceed to beat and bite him to bloody wreck nbut these are the least of billys problems nbilly is heroin addict on the downturn and it does nt seem that hell last much longer nbilly and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis nshe disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it nshe merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments nif this description seems bleak have nt told the half of it nthis is not cheery movie and most of the time its downright depressing nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end its not quite worth it nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends stray puppy nthe film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything ngranted there are few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of catharsis for the creator than us nthe actors do fine job particularly in the central roles nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience noldman got it about half right

bthe above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up bit to make it more inept than it is nit is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously nmr gregg imhavingamidlifecrisis araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such horrible horrible world nand how does he show it nby really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this noh and it gets better na similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film not counting the several masturbation scenes nin it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about nsorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus nof course what do you expect the film was written and directed by guy who ca nt even spell his first name right yes know its cheap joke but it had to be done the doom generation is advertised as road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is fourletter word hardy har har nits film about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon white james duval who would go on to play randy quaids son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do and by the way do you get the symbolism nred white and blue nhuh nhuh and go on road trip where three things happen in no order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them nthe film is basically remix of bunch of other far superior films ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like pop culture reference guide nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper the doom generation does nt want to do this it just wants to show everything in surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level nhe wants to show everything in weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about nheres one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into quicke mart type place to get food and other stuff namy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you love how racist this film is really do tells her to put it out nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note nhe points shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly njordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter nthe cash register rings up oh and this symbolism does nt stop here njordan checks for his wallet but its really in the car nhe asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money nthey say they do nt have it nhe gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerks head clean off clean wound mind you nthe head is shown flying through the air and lands in fryer where it begins to scream ni do nt really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme hell make some kind of art nwrong nit takes kind of resistance to make gore art nwhen george romero made dawn of the dead very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick nsame goes for peter jacksons disgustingly gory dead alive which features minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with guy with lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies nit was sick but it was also satirical and controled na scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens nheres couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by giant sword put there just so this could happen fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances nalso look for about million camoes from wide assortment of people who probably did nt really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter otoole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably did nt when they signed to be in caligula npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line nwhy are they here nso that we can all point to them and say hey look its fill in the blank nwow ngimme break nthe films meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such horrible place that when the two entities collide there giant explosion of horrific violence notherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being teenager is horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you nlook years old ni went through very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did nive since moved on to do nt really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse npart of being teen is experimenting and testing the waters nits not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent nthis is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how they re these great people who are being punished by the world because they re teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but ca nt totally overcome them nits not their fault they kill people its the worlds nwhat they really need is reality check nthe world is bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting nbut part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it nthe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there nothing they can do about it nhence the title nnot only does it have bad fallacy but it ca nt even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner neverythings overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex nhow does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst nhow does talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way nand why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film nif araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction he show them for what they really are nand if he did nt want the satirical approach he show the real problems with the world nand if you still do nt think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting nrose macgowan is horrible nyes she proved herself talented in scream but she so bad in the doom generation that if had not seen her in scream would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today nher entire performance is onenote bitchy and the one scene where she cries over dead animal is so forced that its laughable nequally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who does nt have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain nhis performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do nand then there james duval nlets just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that have now deemed him least talented actor in the world ni have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst nor at least somewhere up there nheres another example of bad scene if you re still not convinced the film opens up in club where they re playing nine inch nails most banal song heresy example of the lines god is deadand no one caresif there is hellill see you there and as the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent nthe film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck nno explanation of this should be necessary nand finally note to gregg grow up nreally nmove out of your parents basement read something other than salinger and get day job nand do nt quit it
bsydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict nbut in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumets reputation na stranger among us ripoff of peter weirs witness belongs to the latter category nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york nduring one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as result she becomes depressed nin order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover nthat is nt easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal nusing peter weirs formula is nt the greatest flaw of this film neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent nbut the worst insult to viewers audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles nrole of emily eden unfortunately is nt one of them nfirst of all she ca nt pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman is nt much better nscreenplay by robert avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch nbut on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community nalso the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time
bthe sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible npeople may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized methodical hatred nfive concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days the first documentary from steven spielbergs survivors of the shoah visual history foundation nthe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry nas the introduction explains even as germany started to lose the war the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe nin hungary had the last big population of jews within germanys reach and they became the last target of hitlers final solution neach of the five tells his or her story ntheir stories are intercut chronologically starting from normal life in prewar hungary nthey recall the nazi invasion of hungary being sent to work camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps nthey recall their horrible precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald the deaths of their family and friends their loss of hope neach recalls his or her unfathomable eventual liberation nand finally the last days shows their cathartic pained modernday return to their old homes and the camps nneedless to say their stories are horrifying amazing and emotionally draining nby themselves the stories would be forceful testaments but by cutting them in parallel their impact is multiplied by five nthe last days is talkingheads style documentary its mostly pictures of people telling their stories intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage nin this kind of movie its almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed onscreen but director james moll made better effort than most at finding specific or at least relevant images to go with his subjects narration nthe liner notes one of the many nice features of this dvd indicate that there is some neverbeforeseen historical footage in the last days nits not clear which scene it is nit could be one of two that had nt seen before both powerful none is rare color footage shot by an american of piles of victims in cattle cars nthere is something jarring something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white nanother segment shows walking skeletons survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore nthere has been glut of holocaust movies and was skeptical that new documentary would have anything new to say nbut by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war moll told specific part of the story in new way in greater detail nand glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject nthe transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful nxmozillastatus words for holocaust documentary but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring when skies are blue and trees are green nalso the movie was shot on mm film and not video nso the richness and detail are impeccable nthe dvds features are plentiful and wellchosen nthere is theatrical trailer for the movie which is great introduction to the subject matter nthere are about fifty still photos both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors nalso the disc has two complete versions of the movie widescreen and full screen both on the same side none of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors plus one for the crew nyoud think outtakes would be inappropriate in holocaust documentary but they re not bloopers ninstead they are solid moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length none of them continues confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film nrenee firestone one of the five spoke on camera with dr hans nch german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz nfirestone was aggressive questioning the doctor about what his children thought nthe doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable nanother of the outtakes showed bill basch saying prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz nhe ends his prayer by saying forgive me for surviving nits ambitious to shoot documentary on mm film nits ambitious to make it on subject that has saturated cable television and movies nits ambitious to make it years after the events it covers nbut the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well nits only fitting that the dvd with its wealth of interesting and relevant features would also be ambitious and successful
bthere exists litany of differences between successful action movie and successful suspense movie naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything fullcircle nfor fans of both genres however realism is key naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movies end non this advice director john frankenheimer the island of dr nmoreau strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller ronin nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing considering the fare that fallen into the same category over the last few years nthe script written by zeik in his bigscreen debut approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission impossible two years ago na certain number of people will be lost by this but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise and tells us dark but stoically realistic tale of group of postcold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here and ronin becomes better movie because of it nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the exspy sam man who called to france to help shady operations controller named dierdre natascha mcelhone recover package nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast especially once the requisite doublecrossing begins and its role is skillfully penned by zeik nat times however zeiks tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission impossible de niro might easily become tom cruise the package might become cruises computer disk nfortunately the focus here is almost entirely on the package whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the doublecross and why it happened nthe action content is impressive and it lives up to the hints given in previews nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect fullblown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness nronin does take degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish but even the uninitiated will be able to keep grasp on most characters mand subplots nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end bit of drawback because of its height at the movies open nconsidering these factors its good to see that ronin was project that turned out well and its another good bet this month nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months its definitely worth the visit
bi had lost all faith in pg movies that are intended for teenagers and adults nthe last dozen or so that have seen have all felt incomplete as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain more lucrative rating nhowever after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting my bias is beginning to go away nboth films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers neven better did nt think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts neveryone loves surprises nu looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets nthis may be true but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear directorcowriter jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal to blow the audiences socks off nset during the early stages of world war when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german uboats follows small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship ntheres only one problem the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on german submarine known as you guessed it nit is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors led by an interim captain named tyler matthew mcconaughey to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships nthe film starts off very slowly with somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear nonce the crew gets on the uboat the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down nas soon as the action starts it does not stop and luckily because it is so exciting did nt want it to stop nthis is not movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises from the wonderful heartpounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men make sure you see this at theater with surroundsound otherwise do not see it all nthe best parts of are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations nthroughout the movie several morals or characters are introduced to make tylers job as stressful as possible ngermans gun down their own men tylers mentor captain dahlgren warns him that captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for victory another sailor erik palladino threatens mutiny nall of these examples and several others increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tylers every move nthey also make one of the most exhilarating movies have seen in while
bcapsule this superlight situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems nthe script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not lot different from what is shown free on television nthe characters are paperthin and the interesting ideas purely nonexistent nthis is decrementlifebyminutes card to njalla jalla nis basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen nit tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love nthe film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at public park roro is from tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is swede from much more liberal background nthey spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs nroro and mans each have girlfriends but each has problem nroro nicknamed jalla is having family problems nit seems that his family wants to arrange marriage between him and nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny nyasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either nmans on the other hand has been having problem of sexual impotence nthe two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other nmans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers nthe one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them nroro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding nnot too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected nthe plot turns in several places are contrived none knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen nlebaneseborn josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps better director than he is writer nwhen things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story nfor example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and long chase is added to the film ncharacterization is little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing biological function nwe do see some of roros family life and his concerns nthat may be because roros background is lot like that of the director nwhile the story was entertaining did not feel that got anything worthwhile from the film nit was just way to pass about an hour and half in my life none does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this ni rate it on the to scale and on the to scale
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nits rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with potentially provocative setup nany hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half nthe films central characters are terry david arquette depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nnick casually asks for terrys wristwatch and eventually cons terry into trade the watch for bottle of pills nof course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch nlearning of nicks condition he only has handful of weeks left terrys compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him nthis is promising premise and mr taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is free spirit with joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into typical lark where the two characters engage in series of generally dull exploits and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with quirky character nthis is bythenumbers plotting buddy movieroad movie redux nhowever dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable nunfortunately that is not the case here where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits nfar from romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like chore to endure than playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond nmr taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that provocative leaves room for further questions nthe film enjoys few inspired moments the urn scene session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes nthis occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital realising that this is intended to be funny although nary smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him this is not film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes nthe entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability namong the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering freshfaced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry nmr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes nthe charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is bit of an odd one coming from me seem to have predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audienceunfriendly nature of their characters nfor dream with the fishes though did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die
bfor film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality trois is surprisingly tame ndespite its lurid subject matter and its passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film nfreshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of perfect life nthey have beautiful house in suburbia njermaine is lawyer on the fast track at his firm njasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree nin an opening montage via home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs nthis is couple that has it all ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust ndespite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as possession than person na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmines concerns nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in menage atrois much to jasmines dismay nas jermaine puts it do nt you want to be sexually free njermaine shares his desire with coworker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with woman who might be interested in just such an encounter nthe woman jade palmer is direct counterpoint to jasmine njade at one point was college student too nunlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet nto further reinforce their differences its revealed that jade is involved in custody battle over her son ninevitably through liquor and touch of duplicity on jermaines part the forbidden act is consummated nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaines property with the hint that the violence may escalate nby this point trois shows itself to be soap opera without the requisite melodrama fatal attraction without the social significance nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical njermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish njasmine is bland and subservient njade comes off bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy nyet another tale of sexually aggressive dog of man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate nthe last minutes will undoubtly throw you curve but by this point will you even care nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it nas it stands trois is pretty standard fare
bweighed down by tired plot lines and spielbergs reliance on formulas saving private ryan is mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches nthere ought to be law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics nspielbergs greatest strength as director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make perfect story nbut for topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films nsaving private ryan tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on pr mission to pull young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after dday nryan is paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france ntheres no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making great war movie nthe equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done nthe opening sequence in which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielbergs brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foulups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops nthe technical side of the film is peerless as always nthe camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems mite out of place as paratroop colonel nyet the attempt at realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film or the story fails to convince nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning to death with relative frequency nfor example we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground nhere and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling man to safety there an explosion and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half man nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact nthere are no shoes with only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are smattering of wicked head wounds nthe relentless dehumanization of the war in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity is softpedaled in the film nultimately saving private ryan bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war nrather than saying saving private ryan is realistic it would be better to describe it as having realistic moments nanother aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussells superb wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war which has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup who is this private ryan that we have to die for him nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight nrendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him nor some variant thereof nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the word and largely about the search for food and sex nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an rating due to violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it family film nhowever the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg nhe can not just cede control to the material he has to be bigger than it nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from schindlers list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain millers last words to private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in which prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain nthat particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the film nnowhere in the film is there resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii saving private ryan can only pan for small truths in the shallows
byouve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over keeping the faith nits fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics love and religion and how romantic triangle causes the two to collide headon nas youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio nwhile their friendship progressed anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support so neither would feel excluded nbut tragedy soon struck as anna was forced to move away nnow adults brian edward norton and jacob ben stiller hold similar but contrastive jobs nthe likable and kindhearted father brian is catholic priest while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as jewish rabbi non the basketball court they refer to themselves as the god squad nin the relationship field brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy but jacob has reached the point where finding jewish bride is practically mandatory neverything changes when anna jenna elfman returns to new york to visit her childhood chums nnow workaholic she devotes endless hours per week to her business but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again nwith these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail there bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters npredicting the outcome is not entirely difficult but keeping the faith is open entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point to point nedward norton has emerged as one of the finest most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the thriller primal fear nafter shockingly bitter roles in american history and most recently david finchers vicious fight club quaint romantic comedy might seem like peculiar choice nnot in the least nnorton slips into the directors chair for the first time with keeping the faith and here his incisive resourceful approach helps add additional craft to surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg nweighing every aspect it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut nin addition norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian generating thoroughly likable screen presence nstiller the zipper guy from there something about mary is firm and funny boasting fullyripened comic maturity nelfmans perky repetition can grow tiresome such is occasionally the case on tvs dharma and greg but she seems perfectly rambunctious here nthe remaining cast members offer fine support from anne bancroft as jacobs animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice nkeeping the faith is the perfect date flick nthough perfection is not word to associate with the film in general nthere is turbulence during the process of liftoff as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead nonce the film does settle in it is often funny and always cheerful nstiller norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities nwe enjoy their interaction understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true nthis is excluding the ending which is acceptable and all but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements nnonetheless narrowly mishandled finale certainly wo nt wipe the smile off your face nor anyone elses in the audience nkeeping the faith is highly enjoyable romantic comedy although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion naww what the hell nthe quality is not quite heavensent but this little charmer could revive our faith in potentially tired filmmaking genre
bis jimmy stewart the greatest actor of alltime nits quite possible nhis career spanned over years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could nyet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role the nice guy nand that really shame the naked spur features jimmy stewart in role completely different than what people would expect from him nits western which stewart specialized in around this period and it casts him as desperate man out to collect bounty on man who used to be his friend nbefore he finds that man though he runs into two men who agree to help him thinking he is sheriff nwhen the criminal is eventually caught the two men discover stewarts secret and decide they want piece of the action too nthe rest of the film is suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly nalso featured is the woman travelling with the criminal well played by janet leigh nwere never too sure who side she really on until the end nleigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the shower lady from psycho and that unfair nshe gives strong performance as woman who is pulled between these two men nstewart gives performance unlike anything ve ever seen from him nhe usually keeps cool no matter what occurs but here he gets downright hysterical at times ni think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just nice guy nhis performance borders on psychotic at times but loved watching every second of it nits roles like this one that make me admire him as much as do nhe was an actor unafraid to take chances and even ruin his public image
bcontact is nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagans only novel nit details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster nwe first meet ellie at giant radio telescope in puerto rico where she is part of the seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence project nher research is quickly killed however by her highly political david drumlin tom skerrit who disdains pure research in favor of science with commercial applications nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to corporation run by the mysterious nhadden john hurt nthen with that money just about to finally dry up ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones very powerful pulsing radio signal nin the movies most exciting and believable sequence ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers then it turns out to be tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from years before nfurther decoding with haddens help reveals another layer to message containing detailed plans for massive and complex machine nit appears that the machine is transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens home world nof course the big question becomes who gets to ride it right after who gon na pay for this thing nto boil it down ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently to keep godless science from talking to god or something like that nthen hadden reappears with startling news nhe has secretly constructed second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie in whom he has taken rather paternal interest nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to dreamlike place that looks lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father david morse nwhen she returns home no one believes her nshe was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for hours nher story is officially discredited although believed by large segment of the public who do nt even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static neighteen hours worth of static nthere is lot to like about contact so will highlight those points first nellie arroway is wellrounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs but that tough standard to meet nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by strange array of father figures nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally ndrumlin comes across as distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble nhadden obviously has affection for ellie but in the end he seems to see her as his creation nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board neven palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellies love interest takes paternalistic interest in ellie seeing her as misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses nthe film is technically impressive especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in film since the andromeda strain nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion nthis is very real debate but contact boils it down to simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved nthe film presents science pretty well until the end so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures nrob lowe plays ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice of the religious right nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine jake busey nthe only really fleshedout religious person palmer joss is supposed to be minister of some sort but his actual faith is left pretty vague ni ca nt even say for certain that he was supposed to be christian nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about premarital sex nthe film drops the science ball at the very end when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith nin day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist religious doctrine this is exactly the wrong message to send nin movie dealing with issues of science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism nwhat ellie should have said was you should nt believe me nnot without evidence and do nt have the evidence ni know what happened but you should nt take my word alone nthat is the voice of science speaking nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for person in his position nalso his profession of faith before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only pack of idiots should have fallen for it nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles nthe media figures such as bernard shaw and jay leno are nt so bad in as much as their participation was voluntary nthe use of bill clinton however should give anyone pause nfirst of all lifting the image of sitting head of state and inserting him into fictional story line thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken is just plain creepy nalso using the real president places this film between and forever dating it npeople watching this film in the future will say hey this never took place during clintons term nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief nalso the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century nbetter to have had fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all nthe film does raise an interesting question although it never develops it in satisfying way nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes belief in god or at least some form of supernatural creator npersonally would hope not since religion is basically an opinion form of

bdid claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion nthat is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in hospital ward with comatose sunny von bulow nshe is the main narrator of the film in narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder nthe dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and lawyers moral dilemma as he takes case he thinks he can not win njeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history nhe is as hated as any man alive as cold as cucumber nhis remorse for his wifes comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas nthe background to the case is such nduring christmas of sunny von bulow fell into deep coma from which she recovered and awoke nthe same situation occured in only sunny never woke and probably never will nwhen examined it was found that she had times the normal amount of insulin within her blood nclaus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail nhe immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him nron silver is magnificent as moral lawyer who can not stand what has happened to him nwe follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for crime they did nt commit and von bulow who he still has nt figured out ndershowitz does nt know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case nnevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him ntogether with group of law students dershowitz concocts defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed nsilvers performance is one of handful of solid roles in this deep film nschroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz nthere are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical nyet due to glenn closes troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as narrator works here fairly well nthe flashbacks are good but at times schroeder does nt fill in the blanks nthe movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used better ending nthe film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion nthe supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitzs team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder oversimplifies the story and the characters nyet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons nas von bulow he is brutally evil nantisemitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame nirons plays him to cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence nhe is an adulterous liar and cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder nhowever the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility nthere is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wifes death by years of neglect and coldness nhowever legally did he do the murder nschroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind nwith all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind nschroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death nfor all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully nwe do nt know what happened nthat sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulows obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works nin the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever nirons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good
bafter stylistic detour with mrs nparker and the vicious circle which despite its uncomfortable tone was close to being conventional movie director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow romantic black comedy about love betrayal and selfabsorption nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into motion picture rudolphs atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing if not always pleasant movie nit is said that rudolph is polarizing director meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it nuntil mrs nparker had not been overly impressed by his movies ni found equinox his last pre mrs nparker effort to be irritating and frustrating ni was somewhat surprised therefore to discover that liked afterglow nthere are several reasons for this but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident mannered aspects of his approach nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems the story is absorbing and the acting is topnotch nin short rudolph has created world that its worth spending two hours in nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples njeffrey byron jonny lee miller is cold seeminglyheartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife marianne lara flynn boyle nfor her part marianne is so obsessed with having baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on human level nall she interested in is seducing him during those few days when she ovulating nafter he refuses to make love she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor nthe other couple lucky nick nolte and phyllis mann julie christie are an older pair but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart nthey remain married as matter of convenience but since phyllis wo nt allow lucky to touch her they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as result of these affairs nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another and it does nt take long before they re lounging together naked in her pool nmeanwhile jeffrey who is captivated by older women runs into phyllis in hotel bar is smitten and invites her to accompany him on weekend retreat to the mountains nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love nsex means something different to everyone to jeffrey its an unpleasant chore loss of control to marianne its means to maternal end to lucky its an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles and to phyllis its method of establishing or denying emotional closeness nultimately none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script but in the performances njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish callous suitandtie businessman nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity nlara flynn boyle who was nt impressive in rudolphs equinox is greatly improved making marianne jumble of sexiness and vulnerability nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky and he manages to deliver some of rudolphs most pregnant lines with practiced ease nthe clear standout however is julie christie who is nothing short of delicious as the worldweary phyllis nher often wry occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the films humor and there hardly ever moment when she does nt steal the spotlight from her costars ni do nt know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph detractors but it seems that this movie is little more accessible than some of the directors earlier productions nenough of his trademark style remains however to reassure his supporters nafterglow is basically fourpronged character study nthe plot is not especially compelling but the character interaction is and that the real reason to see this motion picture nrudolph has painted an able picture of the nonromantic side of love the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction
bdr dolittle th century fox running time hour minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor murphy returns in this abysmal comedy nhe plays doctor john dolittle who as child had the ability to understand animals nhowever after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in crummy job surrounding by crummy people most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt nhowever with bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting to happen nexcept comedy never does happen ndoctor dolittle even with the excellent premise rarely manages to raise laugh npoor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers nthe manic murphy we saw in the is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears to be getting all the work in the nthe voices of the animals which include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie nsadly most of their lines are pretty dumb nand they re not funny dumb like dumb dumber but just boring dumb nthe film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through in desperate attempt to raise some laughs nthere are few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between nif had to choose favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has certain charm about him nsadly he barely in the movie and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time njoke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor nthe director betty thomas has well done better films nshe bought us private parts and the brady bunch movie which were sadly much better than this nthe scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done nthe animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets ntheres an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good nyoud have no problem guessing that most of the close ups are puppets however with their jilted movement ni was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done better job ndoctor dolittle in the end is disappointment for everyone involved nmurphy has done much better movies ntrading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures are nt that good nthe target audience aged between who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks to its dumbed down humour neveryone else however should give doctor dolittle miss
bits sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it nsuch is the case for the paul mayersberg film the last samurai nthough the blurb alludes to jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic middleaged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa nhe hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher nthey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal prearranged arms deal which subsequently falls through ncongo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword nthe end nthe last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable nit is merely there nthe murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all nthe film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie nit is quite slowpaced with only bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic nmost of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congos girlfriend nlance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie nthe only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery ni paid for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect overpaid for it nif you are in the mood for samurai read clavell novel or watch kurusawa movie nskip the last samurai unless you are diehard henriksen fan

bprereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review nbecause of this will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be word you come across and can not comprehend fret not its most likely just another way of referring to sex ni think we all agree that any word used incessantly becomes bit monotonous so hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be very boring review nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what nbody shots is film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you normally expect to see violent attack nits about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it nthese are things we all do sometimes nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed nits as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after busy workweek nat its core body shots is message movie the kind of thing could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition nmichael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is moralist with nothing new to say nhis characters do nt communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera nthey voice simplistic platitudes like like to come or sex without love equals violence nhuh nand yes that is as complex as this movies observations get nthe characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film can not nim not trying to be clever or witty but honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others nwith the exception of trent played by ron livingston as bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence nin between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning nthe fact that this director at one point won pulitzer prize completely baffles me nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and kobsessed fine do nt have any problem with film that tries to persuade me to think certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side nadditionally that one side is nt even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness nor realism none sexual encounter takes place outside club on chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only is nt it erotic it is nt real nit does nt feel like an authentic sexual encounter nevery scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it nthe resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow nthe main concern is much ado over rape that may or may not have occurred nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off nthis is topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me ca nt think of one film that has done so and yes saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the next to wall street nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of noxious spin off npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded nit was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such decision nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them nhe gave them heart ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones nhe preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us nthis is not the way to get any message across nwhy not just direct public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins ncristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with helping of leering exploitation
bpeople who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies noften science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple technothriller nin such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked nbut believe there are really few cases when movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits nbut the right stuff film is nt even fiction nit was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program nthe plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado nbut one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records nten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age nin order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space nbest air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image nin one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for and age when hollywood used to make films larger than life nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker nphilip kaufman created reputation in by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies nthe right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risktaking artsy projects nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film nthe plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles nsam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty non the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases nshepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine and future politician john glenn nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline neverything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world nin that setting its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights nbut the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language nediting is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space nanother fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear it nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period nthis film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws nsome of the mercury astronauts are nt fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen nfilm also lacks proper closure non the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long nalso some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america nin some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early ntime has passed now we do nt see astronauts as heroes nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up nbut this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky nand even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema
bthe thirteenth floor the third in what would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz nall three made you think made you wonder what is real what is nt and if our world is just huge game nthe thirteenth floor does nt reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives great shot at it nin the matrix we were told that the humans are simply virus nin existenz we learned that our life could be just game nin the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices nthere is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated nthe thirteenth floor took huge risky turn that did nt expect it to take and not very sure it was such great turn to make nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin muellerstahl douglas hall played by craig bierko man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year which consists of computer generated characters only nthe simulation of is just like it was back in the olden days nall of the people involved are just characters or are they ndouglas strongly believes that character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller nalong the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by talented young actress gretchen mol nthe thirteenth floor is plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and does nt use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewers interests ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and would nt enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film nunfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened nthe scenes that are nt original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true ni know this is nt true story or anything but film should be able to make you think that it is non the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in actor armin muellerstahl nin the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances nanother plus is gretchen mols realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the onedimensional phase ndont expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would nthrills chills and spills are nt what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until you ve had enough nthe bottom line lets hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile
meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood nscreams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton nmake me laugh again nnot only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they do nt actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes nand we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle

sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the selftitled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest soap opera actress ninterestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them nmaddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another nand they talk nand talk nand talk nin fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long nif you are able to get through the opening halfhour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest nthe question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback nhow could comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film is nt mature enough to deal with such thing in thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought nalso it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes nand when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to repulsively annoying threeminute scene in which they argue like little children nyou can see the impending death coming mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other nyou think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have playful foodfight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits nmeg ryan is versatile actress look no further than hurlyburly or when man loves woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies nwith hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron writerdirectorhack who should nt be allowed to work in hollywood again after this bigbudget highprofile debacle neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas when she had heartbreaking runin with her mother and to halloween when lou crashed her sons birthday party in drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations ndiane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than director here but that is wildly feeble compliment nwhat is more than little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryans senior nyeah right nlastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in bigscreen venture after her even more thin role in analyze this nkudrow is nt given enough time to create full personality with maddy so it is nt her fault she does nt register until few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue nif anything though kudrow is real talent and anxiously await the next time she is given role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work in the opposite of sex nif you are fan of kudrows and who is nt do yourself favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety nas eves hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with role that gives him next to nothing to do until subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again ncloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as rosycheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nnearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats nif for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over nsaying it is waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions
bone of my brothers favorite movies is halickis cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the carchase genre that provided drivein fare during the nchase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had strong visceral appeal nalthough it boasts bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull nrandall memphis raines nicolas cage is retired car thief who runs gocart track nhe got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars nhowever kip became thief anyway and now he in big trouble nkip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week ncalitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain if he does nt come through kip dies nmemphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys ncross william lee scott scott caan and james duval nas if calitri breathing down their necks was nt bad enough the team is pursued by cop delroy lindo who still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by rival gangster rap star master who wants to take over calitris clients nwatching gone discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one nmaybe that why the first fortynine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor shelby gto model that has always eluded memphis nbut the big chase does nt live up to the long wait ni had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic senas second film kalifornia his debut was brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience nin that movie sena took simple thriller plot couple gives serial killer ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance nin gone he seems to be aiming for drama about two brothers who ca nt communicate with each other but that goal just does nt mesh with this plot gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough nits not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense nthis chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it nthe lack of action is waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever nthe weak script is waste of talented cast nin newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies nmuch as like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air mm city of angels nthat ratio is probably better than what lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent nits shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in seconds
bi tried hard not like this movie without succeeding nit contains parts of bringing up baby any hepburntracy film part of the plot of war games cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday elevator shaft action train action and murder nit is cute funny suspenseful little bit sexy little bit none of the bad guys was surprise nthe pace is fast enough there are some action scenes ni think that this is reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick njulia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together ni really identified with the julia roberts character wishful thinking know but do have better hair nher hair very dull dark brown has no color nshe could use some highlights nthey both do fine with their roles he bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she hotshot cub reporter with the chicago globe nthey have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie ni like the one story focus nother actors include charles martin smith as roberts boss olympia dukakis as noltes coworker nora dunn also with the chronicle and marsha mason as congresswoman nbasically this movie is reasonably fun nthere is serious mystery to solve and enjoyed following fun couple solving the mystery nit is pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously ni do give successful comedy high marks
bheres concept jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie nnow if that is nt enough to get you to finally see van damme movie do nt know what is nall sarcasm aside it is certainly different way to start movie of course few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jeanclaude nvan damme works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives nvan damme is police officer in france who finds out that he had twin brother he never knew about after gets killed in france nthe remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death nonce there he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are njeanclaudes acting abilities do nt seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie nin other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal non the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked nsadly this is probably the high point in the movie nshe is actually decent actress but did nt improve as much as thought she would after species nthis is the typical van damme movie with jeanclaude doing variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents nnothing new here and certainly nothing we have nt seen in every other van damme movie nsimply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie nit has retread plot this is nt the first time jeanclaude has played twins nhe still ca nt act nwe all saw natashas breasts in species although this is one repeat performance not complaining about nthis is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par
btbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever nnot surprising considering its tiny us budget to date it has earned in excess of us million nthats shocking times profit nrumours have it that smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cultlike fanatics by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews the film just exploded in the boxoffice raking in millions on its opening weekend nshot in mm and video suspectx the film chronicles the forays of students who go in search for the legendary blair witch naudiences are put in the firstperson perspective in the entire misadventure often wobbly and blurry at times it takes bit of getting used to in the beginning nthis is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the disappeared edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences ntbwp is simply smart nfilmed to look as if it was really stockshoot by bunch of students in search of the blair witch as school project one may suspect like yours truly that its simply lazy but smart approach to filmmaking nsimply amazing in that respect must say ntalk about impact oh yes tbwp does have quite bit in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing ni did especially the last bit but not revealing more nyou have to see it for yourself ni ca nt help but feel tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become ncould it be that finally an indiefilm has unwittingly found formula for commercial appeal nor was it all simply ploy by the big players right from the beginning nwell guess the fact stays tbwp is highly original clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film nno gore no special effects just ca nt get over how terribly smart this film is
bi suppose its unfair to criticize movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since its release nmichael lehmanns actioncomedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk who just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation let me put it this way he explains never saw et ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes nthese are rather welcome in movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences nit appears as if director lehmann did nt know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things could nt get goofier you ll soon be eating your words nbut inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest nits fastpaced and entertaining if you ve got incredible patience and warped sense of humor nfor the first portion of this review going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk nwish me luck nfirst and foremost bruce willis is good sport nwhile not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is big fat ugly joke nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and outofplace which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character nthey meet when hudson goes on mission to steal priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there nits unfortunate that mcdowells onenote character is used just as an excuse for there to be predictable plottwist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis nbut now rambling on again about the negative things are nt nenough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience nits stupid pointless and repetitive ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really does nt have the potential to please anyone naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited nand those expecting hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headacheinducing hijinks ndont get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs nits too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed nits understandable to see willis and aiello in movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn not entirely sure ncoburn plays former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has fight with willis that would look right at home in jackie chan film nthings get more bizarre when were introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless cardflipping kitkat nif that not enough for you there richard grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as deranged couple on the brink of convoluted economic takeover ntheir crotchbiting pooch provides couple of the big laughs here nwait maybe the only big laughs nim not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk ni ca nt even begin to start about the films absurd plot but lets not get into that ni suppose there some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate nbut hudson hawk never even has clue of where its going from minute one and from there its minutes of pure cinematic muck
balien is the only alien film have seen in theaters ni saw it when was years old and must admit that did nt like it nof course was expecting aliens again and believe this was my fault nin order to appreciate alien you need to see aliens but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor njames camerons aliens was an action film and many people consider it the best in the series ni am among that group but alien is an extremely entertaining film which critics have bashed for its originality nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action nboth are untrue because the film has quite bit of action and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten nas for the chase sequence it was long but not overly long creating quite bit of suspense from confusion nperhaps watching alien on video helped non the big screen was overwhelmed by something normally did nt see nit was very dark film and the language was extremely harsh ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities ndont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing but when film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks it gets rather distracting nhowever since seeing it again realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters nas result alien only flaw albeit major one is the underdeveloped characters nwe never really care about any of them and get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie nthere were only two characters liked and of course one was lt ripley sigourney weaver although we have gotten to know her through two other films nthe other character was dr clemens charles dance but because we like him the inevitable occurs nalien begins exactly where aliens left off nthe prologue of alien is pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry nwithout using single line of dialogue unless you count computer warnings fincher sets up the entire film nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows few seconds of film before cutting to title card nwe see lt ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments title na shot of an alien egg title nalien legs stretch up into the air title nand so on and so on nduring these first ten minutes learned everything had to in order for alien to proceed nits quite remarkable opening and one which will remain in my mind for long time nbecause of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod and sent down to the nearest planet fiorina fury an ore refinery which has been turned into maximum security prison nhowever the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes and is sent down with the escape pod nunfortunately during the landing all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery nof course you need carrier for this facehugger and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates nripley is revived and asks to see the ship nafter seeing mysterious acideaten section ripley asks to see the dead bodies and then have them cremated nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films nfeaturing monologue from dillon charles dutton prisoner who has found god the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise nits one of the most memorable moments as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog nand this is where alien succeeds nfincher normally injects lot of symbolism into his films and can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock in fact he is the mixture of both nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it and figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films nalien is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images nby doing so fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise nmany people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley reveal nothing by saying this as looking too fake but enjoy and relish in the portrayal nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is nice touch but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron great deal of symbolism is derived ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron nhowever most people seem to want to witness ripley die which creates paradox as she is the character did nt want to see die nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film and do nt plan on spoiling that in this review nfrom every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever nin alien it was of course the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach nin aliens it was the showdown between alien and ripley in machine nalien has several but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley nripley is pushed up against wall and the alien stands inches away from her nwhy it does nt kill her is shocker which later leads to surprise ending nfincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style and by shaving off the actors hair the only thing we have to look at is their faces nmany critics did nt like all the actors being bald but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot nmost of alien works when you take it in context of the story but when you try to compare it to its predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy and dark though that not always bad thing nthe plot is pretty much rehash of the first two films with some major twists nagain we are setup with several different characters and one by one they are picked off nhowever while the first two had tons of arsenal especially camerons film alien takes place on planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison nas result no weapons are to be found nthis creates lot of tension although must admit that fincher could have added lot more suspense nas an alien film alien is the worst of the series but by itself it is an extremely wellmade motion picture with lot more merits than not nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom really could care less about ndespite this ripley was the central figure and that what is important nwe care for her even though she began to act just like one of the guys nagain the technical side of this film is remarkable and better than the two previous versions nwhile camerons version was pumped up action film with massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting and moody sets nthe cinematography by alex thomson is very well done with terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around nthe yellows reds and oranges of the lights create dark mood and by themselves create lot of suspense nshadows dance on the walls and yet those shadows could easily be the alien nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien racing after the characters nthe sets are quite incredible which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed nthe sets appear to be in the future but not too far in the future none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien nothing surprising there nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one mainly because the film was critical bomb nher reactions are far more realistic in this film with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter nits quite touching really ncharles dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates and was on the brink of actually caring for him ncharles dance turns in nice lowkey performance and as result cared for him immediately nlance henriksen makes brief appearance as bishop ii but he was more entertaining in aliens nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world nalien is rated for strong violence and language and sex nalthough it has its flaws alien is highly entertaining with rich symbolism nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout movie nwhile kubrick may have moral message throughout his films fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out nits film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for film to sacrifice quality for quantity the final scene nin fact it tells us that we as society have become too critical of things which may happen to look little fake nwhenever something looks fake on screen we immediately point it out as mistake nbut perhaps it is nt mistake
bultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about group of friends vacationing in cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon the book of the dead nbruce campbell stars as ash who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods and his friends who have become demons including his own girlfriend nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the films tiny budget constant location changes and filming schedule that was sporadic over two years nfollowed by two sequels evil dead ii and army of darkness nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in its original aspect ratio of nthe disc contains two versions of the films audio stereo track and newly remastered dolby digital nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks the first features writerdirector sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the films star bruce campbell ncampbells commentary is informative and extremely witty as he has story to tell for virtually every scene in the film nsuch informative tidbits include the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead and in fact when the film premiered in that was its title and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard nalso there scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to tape recorder which they ve found that explaining about the demonic forces in the woods nfor that scene it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana so being the wacky kids that they were at the time they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actors had never smoked before and as result they became confused and were unable to perform the scene ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimirob tapert audio track nthe two people you think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all ndont get me wrong here when they do speak its entertaining to hear but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask have anything to say sam nto me that not good sign nalso it seems like sam raimi does nt remember much about the film and its production nwell compared to rob and bruce anyway nalso included on the disc is photo gallery which includes pictures from the films gala premiere and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film nthis raw footage really shows you how much film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques noverall the evil dead is good low budget horror film superior to many films in its genre nand the collectors edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either fan of the film or just fan of the filmmaking process nall special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining

breed apart casts rutger hauer as crazy birdloving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner na bit hard to swallow nthats only the first of many improbabilities in this film nhauer stars as man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe while boothe plays guy hired to steal couple of rare eagle eggs by rich egg collector nturner is the woman caught between the two men breed apart is nt bad movie exactly nindeed found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters even though their goals could nt be more different nthe problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies nfor example early on in the film hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at his birds nlater on the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people and hauer kills few of them ni have tough time believing that the police would nt get involved at that point nanother problem is the silly lovetriangle that develops ni did nt care one way or the other who ended up with turner ni was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions nhowever despite this uninteresting subplot turner did manage to give great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there more to life than money and birds nas for hauer he an actor ve always admired nhe has penchant for picking strange and unusual characters nand this one is no exception nhes frequently seen riding around his island on white horse wearing pirates clothing and holstering crossbow ndespite all his eccentric mannerisms though hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through nfor example there scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island day early nhe comes off as crazy loner in that scene but few minutes later he is apologizing to turner and we believe his intentions nsoon after we find out he vietnam vet and his actions become fairly clear to us breed apart is nt great movie by any means but it does contain good performances by all three leads and its worth seeing for that reason alone
bin the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow nwhat makes this film such grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film navika goldsmans screenplay is such cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another nthis coming on the heals of such marvelously written project as the client is such shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was fluke nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens to be alfreds niece nthe story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought nwhile working on cure for tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during cryogenic procedure and becomes man who can only survive in sub zero environment nnow of course he has become terrorist intent on turning the world into frozen planet where only he can live nnow the logic of that little subplot escapes me nif mr freeze wanted to find cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in world with no warmth nthis is indeed cold hearted man nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory nshe wants to breed form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal nshe joins with mr freeze in his plan to start new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them nthe characters have no logic nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any

bwhat surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker nand indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the tv series non one hand nicholsons joker is extremely funny nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film nbut on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind nthe jokers cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister nthis guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it nbut enough about nicholson as the joker sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman nlike many was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting nkeaton delivers nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city nvisually batman is knockout nothing short of triumph for director tim burton and his production team nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke nburtons film is feast for the eyes the million budget is definitely on the screen nthe sets costumes and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nnicholson is nt joking when he boasts wait till they get load of me nhis grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous nkeatons wardrobe is equally appropriate nbatmans cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop nproduction designer anton fursts sets are wonder ngotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york nthe batcave is cold bare and desolate nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption nthe movies gritty bladerunnerrobocop look is joy to behold nthe plot on the other hand is not as rousing nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear nbatman tries to walk thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one nas mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings nin terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story nmore than anything batman is mood film nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books nthanks to its distinctive look the movie like good comic book transports us to another world
bmickey mouse had better watch his back there new critter in town and he the nameless animal attraction of mouse hunt dreamworks skgs clever first foray into family fare nalthough it runs out of steam towards its end this liveaction comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disneys entire nonanimated kiddieoriented catalog nbut consider that list includes dismal tripe like air bud flubber and that darn cat and its really not such difficult feat to pull off nstill throw the two rodents in boxing arena and ill be hoping that the mouse from mouse hunt knocks some sense back into mickey nnathan lane robin williams significant other from the birdcage and lee evans last seen as nervous bellhop in the fifth element play ernie and lars smuntz befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father william hickey in his last role dilapidated old string factory and dilapidated old mansion nalthough lars made deathbed promise to upkeep the former he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by famed architect nbut there lone obstacle in their way single mouse lives within the walls of the house and he not about to give up his place of residence without fight nmovies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite nthe effects blending the talents of some live mice one animatronic mouse and one computergenerated mouse are pretty seamless nthe splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burtons mind the smuntzs architecturallyunsound mansion is like something straight out of the nightmare before christmas and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent prices warped contraptions from edward scissorhands mouse hunt is pretty dark movie even some of the humor can be grim but its hardly ever meanspirited nthe star of the show is neither the topbilled lane nor the titular mouse nits lanky british comedian evans whose hysterical bodily antics suggest cleanedup jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill note toneddown but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease evans banter with the everaffable lane is funny stuff too and holds its own against the movies more flashy physical shtick nvicki lewis beth from newsradio is solid in supporting role as lars moneygrubbing wife nand in nifty bit of novelty casting christopher walken is macabre delight as spooky exterminator who takes his job little too seriously popping dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has calcium deficiency nblech na basically onejoke idea mouse outsmarts couple of bumbling humans is given rather engaging execution ntheir sparring is imaginatively realized do nt think ill ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on rolling wheel of gouda and although you really never fully root for either side that okay warmandfuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share mouse hunt may take while to get going the rather lengthy setup could test the patience of some of the younger children although rather liked it much in part to lane and evans and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for bit too long but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable not unlike the original home alone
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned all the worlds stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts excerpt from as you like it act ii scene nwhen william shakespeare penned this passage he could not have possibly envisioned world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash nthis is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil prototypical highconcept project like the truman show ntruman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life nhe has pretty doting wife meryl laura linney comfortable insurance sales position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paws greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise nor so it would seem nbizarre inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move nfor the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be nthe truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is remarkably wellconstructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next nbalancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy nin many ways mr niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal characterdefining moments occurring at sea nalthough the films rather conventional climax does nt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film it remains foremost finelycrafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the film eschews any psychological ramifications for man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog vs nthe system formula nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some elements are lacking nthe device of mysterious laurensylvia natascha mcelhone as contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness is nt exactly convincing ntheres not much of discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film nin fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling nstill the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city nive always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses tremendous comic gift she has always seems to have impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans ncheerfully going over the top its hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of film nms linney is delight in the film nbut it is mr carrey who rules the show here nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal its difficult not to root for truman nin commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there an early scene where he down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags nits almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play character who constantly the centre of attention nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic white picketfenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitzs original score ntechnical credits are firstrate all around nwhile the truman show is clearly definitive highconcept film its not exactly dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from secret agent through to the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner nall the same this is visionary awardcalibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent nthe curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such scenario nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question nperhaps we recognize bit of ourselves in this world

bwhen film is produced on shoestring budget by couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of genuine tragedy the easy path for reviewer who hated the movie is to give it pass ntoss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it nthis of course will be of no service to your readers but at least you ll avoid the hate mail from the movies fans nthus it is with heavy heart that review the movie paulina not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about talking parrot ndirected by vicky funari as labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on film the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez npaulina was maid in vickys household when vicky was young ni got to learn the films background when attended screening in which the two women who made it were present nfor those without such context the reaction to the film may be that it is parody of bad indie film nthe acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of bad home movie ngrainy and overexposed the movie shot on mm film and videotape has little to recommend it nconfusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story nquite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed to shock and repulse us nwhy else would you include scene with completely nude and bloody yearold paulina nanother scene has teenage paulina being fondled on bus by the man sitting next to her nin retaliation she bites off part of his finger nthis covers the both of them in bucket of blood nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner none for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out large heart that she had just cut from body nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten ncertainly she had to endure miserable life nbut that does not guarantee that movie about her will necessarily being good ni felt trapped in the theater watching it nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable npaulina runs nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles nit is not rated but would be an for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers

bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned njames tobacks return to directing after eightyear layoff two girls and guy is film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and great deal of dialogue nembracing near realtime approach this is highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters nfortunately the films cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing nthe films setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly nwe meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside soho loft nas they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it does nt take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being twotimed by the same guy nmore indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for confrontation nits when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is cad all right but captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights nits fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour nwhether he flamboyantly behind his piano in rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful nthough at this point almost hoped the film would transform into oneman show typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carlas unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag ndoubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film nhowever it be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the films tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat nsubtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla ntwo girls and guy was embroiled in bitter longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious nif anything two girls and guy serves as showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from selfassured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered nits wonderful performance in role customtailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in monologue to his mirrored reflection blakes selfchiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance nwhile mr downey jr showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles nms graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has screenplay penned by akiva goldsman nshes quite appealing here playing character at once both dainty and sultry nmeanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses but found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout ntwo girls and guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged good deal of improvisation from his three actors nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it does nt feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner ntwo girls and guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr its still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends an actor he tells them at one point using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense actors lie nbut not they all seem to agree denzel

bcopyright graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives nsid james plays henry who no sooner has the film started is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon nas part of his alliance with france he requests the handinmarriage to the queen of normandy joan sims nshe comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has reeking garlic breath he is totally averse to the idea of marriage nhenrys court is very corrupt with the cardinal terry scott trying to bribe cromwell kenneth williams and cromwell trying to bribe the king nthere is state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen sims in the tower of london ready for execution nthe queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey who has rather lecherous character to play this time nthe cardinal and cromwell decide to get signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices nowing to circumstances sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he is nt nthis is because of renewed threats by the king of france peter gilmore to come over himself which in the end he does nby then henry has found himself new queen played by none other than barbara windsor nit looks like he has some explaining to do nthere are standout performances by sid james as henry joan sims as marie and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal nalso there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth who plays barbaras father nthe set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good nthere is even an early appearance from david prowse who later became the green cross code man and darth vader nthe film does have its downsides though as it is getting pretty routine for the carryon team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly nthere is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw who could have helped the film along nhowever overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes so that is why mainly recommend it to carry on fans only but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyones while to sit down and watch it
blike the wonderful drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physician oliver sacks nsince awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama nthe film begins as amy mira sorvino stressedout new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country nat the hotel she is staying at she makes massage appointment and after long soothing session which ends with her crying as release of emotions she strikes up conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind namy does nt really care if he has handicap or not and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love nonce she has returned to new york amy begins to research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness which he has had since three years of age and out of stroke of luck comes into contact with doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgils sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history nat first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis nultimately the surgery is success but problems arise since virgil can not relate to what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects nhe moves into amys apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgils maladjustment begins to put strain on their relationship non the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed film that has been done many times before and owes great deal to its predecessor awakenings nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance nhowever what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy nusually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort the recent tom hanksmeg ryanstarrer you ve got mail immediately pops to mind but with this film grew to care more about the characters and their plight nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly lot of chemistry between the two nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to contrast in the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having comforting peaceful life in the country to amys eventful life in the big city nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board nval kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as blind person and playing his character was probably little more tricky than it appears nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off nmira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash in hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won welldeserved oscar as kindhearted but ditzy hooker is standout here nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then mimic the replacement killers she always has managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally has another juicy role to play nin truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces nkelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad onedimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother nfinally nathan lane who is usually little too overthetop is appropriately restrained as vision therapist nthe one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder nin awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed nbecause of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deals with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the films few problems can be swept over to the side nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the reallife couple that the film was inspired by who are still together after many years even though the setting of the film was changed to new york nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as refreshing and sophisticated change of pace
bits probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre the matrix existenz would collide with the even more popular serialkiller genre kiss the girls seen nthe result should have been more interesting than the cell nas the movie opens therapist catharine deane jennifer lopez treats catatonic boy colton james by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that never fully explained nafter months of therapy sessions in surreal desert catharine has no success to report nmeanwhile killer carl stargher vincent donofrio has claimed another victim nhis particular hobby is to kidnap young women keep them in glass cell overnight and drown them nhe takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching video tape of the drowning nalthough carls been doing this for awhile he recently become sloppy and fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn is closing in fast nnot fast enough though to keep carl from sticking another woman tara subkoff in the cell or to catch him before he suffers schizophrenic attack that leaves him in coma nfrom the videos in carls house peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction nto save the kidnapped girl peter has to find the cell before the end of the day and comatose carls not talking nso off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carls mind and find out where the cell is in time nthe focus of the cell in on the ornate interior of carls mind but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computergenerated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality nfor the most part its style without substance nin his own mind carl is decadent emperor in flowing robes ming the merciless as well as frightened boy jake thomas abused by his father nall in all the mind of psycho killer turns out to be strangely dull place and kept wishing could fastforward to the next development nsingh is best known for directing music videos particularly rems losing my religion and the cell seems very much like really long really slow mtv video with the sound deleted nsinger lopez seems to think she in video as well she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting nthe premise had great promise nthe computergenerated world within carls mind could have been bizarre surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic nthe first room catharine enters in carls head shows this promise nshe finds horse standing in center of the room suddenly sheets of sharpedged glass fall into the horse dividing it into segments nthe panes of glass separate pulling apart the pieces of the stillliving horse nthis scene is twisted disturbing and thoughtprovoking because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder nanother element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of psychopath ntheir minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharines own psyche nlike sidney lumets the offence or michael manns manhunter the cell could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out repressed darkness in the investigator nhowever catharines character is hardly developed at all and lopez has no depth to offer the role nbottom line do nt get trapped in this one
bcontrary to popular belief not every single foregin film released to an american market is masterpiece nsome of them are nt even good nsome examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful un indien dans la ville presented as little indian big city and remade into that crap tim allen flick junglejungle and this nwhat could have been clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of french flick french twist the cool american title not the real one which was gazon maudit literally meaning twisted ground or something like that deals with married couple with kids and the intrusion of stranger who kinda screws things up for them nloli and alain chabat victoria abril and alain chabat are not exactly happily married nalways on business trips alain chabat more than once cheats on her and she eventually finds out nand one day she meets butch mechanic marijo the cowriterdirector josiane balasko and they two kinda hit it off nso she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious sleeping with marijo nbut she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo but she also realizes she still in love with alain chabat nso of course she does the obvious from that she decides to keep them both nshell be and sleep with each of them for days each then on sunday shell rest by herself nafter all she needs it if she gon na have more sex than sylvia kristel nthe film goes on for over an hour and half through stupidity after stupidity moronic twist after moronic twist and soon there the little ironic nending ni know its completely different culture and quite familiar with the french and their cinema but this is just bad nnone of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in fargo movie where stupid characters were backed up to make point and any action they do is pretty much just to get hopeful chuckle from the audience nwhats shocking is this was not only one of frances biggest hits but it was nominated for lot of cesars french equivalent of oscars nthe writing and directing is really the big problem with it njosiane balasko does good acting job with her role but her little sex comedy is nt very humerous entertaining or even deep at all neven woody allens notverygood midsummer nights sex comedy is intelligent wellwritten and possesses some depth nthis is shallow unfunny and pretty annoying to watch nthe film moves at the pace of snail and is damnnear painful to watch nthank god for the fast forward button nthe acting however is nt bad at all nthe actors do the best they can with the bad material and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script and the fact that she stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids nand alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband nbut french twist is just pretty lame nits not overly horrible and has couple very very very brief moments nbut its just really crap film and an example of an illadvised distribution of foreign film
bthe ring is probably one of the creepiest movies ve seen in years nbut then again ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films ni remember when was kid was scared as hell with those green faced longhaired floating ghosts donning their white gownsxxeuuugh nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended nunlike the horror films coming from the west pretty much used to the gore and visual effects so much so they become rather bland nowadays ntheres really no scary movie from the west for long time nif you have something in mind please tell me nthis japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by the stephen king of japan which is also heard televised over the air in japan nthe film revolves around mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it one week prior to viewing na journalist and her husband stupid enough tests the so call urban legend and ends up having week before she meets her doom nshe and her husband then goes on search for the origin of the videocassette to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves nthe ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today nvisual subtlety minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film nvery well done indeed especially for film that does not have single trace of violence and gore nnow thatxs something budding horror filmmaker wannabes should consider looking into njust an idea of how visually powerful the film is it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese both of which ca nt understand at all ok had friend who gave me gist prior to watching but he revealed very little nthe twists in the plot leading to an unforgettable climax will definitely leave an impression on the audience will have you at the edge of your seat

bbreakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route to california through redneck country nhowever while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides to break down leaving them stranded na friendly truck driver warren walsh offers to give them lift to town nalthough jeff rejects the offer he wants to stay with his car amy agrees hops into warrens lorry and promptly disappears njeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on chase to find his wife nalthough comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance and the vanishing plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise nkurt russell is as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression which is angry nthroughout the whole film he looks angry or just pissed off nquinlan is again but again she can only pull off one expression which is looking dorky nthroughout the whole film she looks dorky nj walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough nthe supporting cast do their best aswell with rex linn as doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers nthe story written by firsttimer jonathan mostow who also directs is if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid nsome of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy nthere are some flaws with the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite to logical presumably to keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just is nt strong enough to sustain the audiences attention nthe picture moves along very slowly also nit almost threatens to drop dead nthe picture does pick up towards the end but by then its too late nmostow directs the action sequences well enough however nthe film does nt really come to satisfying conclusion either nthe ending tries to be bleak but just comes off annoying nbreakdown could of been far more enjoyable picture had it had stronger cast and director ninstead it just turns out to be merely average na missed opportunity noverall rating review by david wilcock
bcapsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of landmark for having spawned jillion clones nbasic instincts worst crime is that its not just bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well nits stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is nits supposed to be thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary its only put into the movie to jerk us around nits also supposed to be sexy but its instead got the unpleasant rawness of teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures nits ripoff nthe story opens with rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm nthe biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote novel in which the murder was eerily presaged nor maybe its the work of copycat nthese and other plot threads get fed to the detective who on the case michael douglas who has few problems himself nlike we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor nwe can measure with stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance njoe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killers identity is kept secret until the movies final shot nthis is nt in itself problem the problem is that up until that point we ve been given nothing to work with nevery clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous nthe whole thriller aspect of the movie is shill nred herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets nthey add up to zip because they re not happening to people we care about ndouglass character is foulmouthed and bitter and that it stones character has an ironon smile that never changes the rest are forgettable nwhen we do nt even have the luxury of giving damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it nespecially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable friend of mine once came up with rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave none of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someones life but as kind of kink something to thrill men with ni despair whenever encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in bigbudget hollywood film is as hefnerism

ba disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous th century french poets nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities nthe result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it could nt build on to show them as the poets they were non paper this should nt have been so terrible it had talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and capable cast nbut the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like teenage brat than young genius spouting obsenities without giving hint that true poet lies behind that facade nhe especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin character he was forced to be nbut when the two of them were together it looked like mismatch nleonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring nthe film opens in postrevolutionary france in the yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine letter with his poems nhe accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville nonce there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty yearold wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common with her nwhen verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in haughty tone only if they re bad poets nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship nverlaine proves to be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable character as rimbaud nwhen mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in rooming house and the two become lovers nits real downer to watch this story unfold into series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for divorce nin brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and gunrunner and after ten years there comes home with tumor on his knee and dies changed man at the age of nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying nthe film ends on whimper with nverlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published nthis film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just did nt work nit certainly did nt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry
bbefore you read my review you got ta know that love woody allen nthis is very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone ni know folks who believe him to be complete genius while others see him as dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again ni love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the nin fact why he felt the need to make movies in those years is beyond me nif you look at the quality of those films you ll hear what saying nthe only two films of his that really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives nin fact secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to reenergize or something but it does nt appear as though he has any intention of doing that nso here am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old nplot the year is and woody allen is topnotch insurance investigator nhis methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date na new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency nthe two do not like each other none night they are both put under hypnotic trance by magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control nsoon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer ncritique wonderful recreation of the style movies with the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore and fluffy if inconsequential plotline non the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy nthe sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man nbut it was nt not long before was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool nof course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue and once again allen does great job in playing his character who for once is nt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude nhe actually plays macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which he hypnotized nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time nanyway she really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to new era of equality amongst men and does nt miss beat of allens fastpaced dialogue ni did nt care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left room but overall she was really good and especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum nyum nharumph but digress nso lets recap na great looking picture with nice jazzy score some funny oneliners especially in the second half decent plotline although you should nt expect real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around ni ca nt say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work but certainly believe it to be step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through nits probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but would still recommend this film to anyone looking for cute oldschool kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and satisfying conclusion nlittle known facts about this film and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally you ve got mail

bcapsule godawful comedy that amazingly shabby and cutrate and rather bereft of laughs ni was having bad week in my life when saw austin powers international man of mystery ni desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so could get clear head nget some perspective neven dumb movies can do that for me sometimes ni tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day won the lottery nmichael myers has taken character that would barely have supported fiveminute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of feature film padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of propsstrategicallypositionedbetweennakedactorsandcamera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago nthe plot what little there is of it back in the swinging mod hep sixties do nt think doing disservice to the movies attempted early look and feel by describing it that way sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr evil nevil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later when powers was out of the picture npowers also had himself frozen and he wakes up to find the nineties very hard time to deal with nthe basic gag that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with nthe bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics james bond gags of which this movie has no end right down to the silly character names inept slapstick toilet humor and strategically placed props nthe movies amazingly bereft of ideas come to think of it with couple of bright exceptions none is dr evils son there is sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group chaired by carrie fisher and the other is throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind couch its visual gag hard to describe and hard to recommend seeing the movie for na lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie but its desperate rather than clever ninstead of skewering the whole thing its rather bloodless and unfunny tribute nmyers himself is also desperate he given an idea to play not character nplus the attempts to make the character work by giving him relationship with another sexy albeit nineties agent are waste of time ni wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her only to have her deck him one nwith couple of exceptions the movie misses all of its own best moments nthe movie even looks cheesy and not in good way kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hidef video or something so grainy was the film stock in good many scenes nthe whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap nmy definition of comedy is simply did it make me laugh nthe few times that laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time spent cringing and wanting out nthe most damning thing could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tysons shorts and sent it sailing
ba documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are africanamerican nan offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession nit is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their hos and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get ni learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used nit makes for film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has sense humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing nthey seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money nits also power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place nthis sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears nthese verbose pimps had smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face nthe hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the featherhatted furcoated diamond ringwearing gold chain wearing flashy cadillaccruising pimp of the late blaxploitation movieslike the mack and willie dynamite nalso used as reference was iceberg slims bestseller pimp the story of my life nwe meet pimps such as fillmore slim cnote charm kred gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd nthey readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimps ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money nthese dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves priests need nuns yaps cnote san francisco pimp doctors need nurses nso hos need pimps nas he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors nthe race issue was brought up right from the films onset as number of white interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of pimp is that he the lowest form of human nwhile we are told in the black community the pimp is looked upon as successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in flamboyant style where his snakegaiter shoes might cost him grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community nwe also see that the black pimps have number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations nthe film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run hardsell riff about the virtues of their work nthere are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted nit is also failed to get the womens side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word nthe film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their minutes of fame nthe only laughs got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how few pimps retired and what they are now up to ndanny brown became blues singer so he could keep his pimps wardrobe nwhile hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as telemarketer
bon the basis of this film alone never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the countrys biggest hotshot director nreservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf nheres what the two movies do have in common nscenes of intelligent amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racialgender slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf nreservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because its only got one story to tell rather than three ncrime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull diamond store heist nthe five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated ninstead they are all given code names off the color chart mr white keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantinos chin nmost of the movies running time is spent with mr white and pink waiting at warehouse for the others to arrive nmr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from gunshot wound nthe police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading white to believe one of the five was an informant nthe storys background unfolds through series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime neventually blonde arrives with police officer hostage and what follows is truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene nlets just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cops ear na lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heistgonewrong movie but there are few sequences that are uniquely tarantino nthe opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on high note the rest of it does nt live up to as the criminals plus joe have conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonnas like virgin nanother scene involves roths lengthy manufactured story about running into group of cops and police dog in bus station bathroom while carrying giant bag of marijuana nneither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie nreservoir dogs is good but its no pulp fiction
bmartial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger nhes also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art nim sure the guys good and he seems like nice guy on talk shows although tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although kinda liked under siege nof course this one as change has message that is drilled into our mind of ncourse after he blows up lot of stuff and kills bunch of people nso why do watch his crap ni usually do nt ni will never and you can hold me to this will never pay to see this mans movies unless and only unless he in supporting role executive decision and definitely pay if he dies executive decision nbut this one has special place in my heart nthis does nt mean its good or that even liked it nthis was the last movie watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of time ripping it apart la mystery science theatre and this was couple years before had heard of mystery science theatre nin this one seagal plays worker for mining factory set in alaska and run by the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played by an oscarwinner to give the movie some more clout michael caine nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land naround the minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or ndoes he nseagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here none of caines cliched henchmen played here with lot of overacting by john mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on voyage to take down the oil factory literally nof course nat one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech about how he does nt have any options but blow stuff up nhe even goes as far as to say do nt want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is ni have no problem with violence nim huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence nin the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them nat some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of way to do away with them and does nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it did nt take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summers con air nbut seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message ni would nt mind if this was message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence nbut seagal has no idea how to present film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewers mind nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we ca nt take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job nthen at the end he spends good minutes giving speech just in case you did nt get the message from the trailers nwhat seagal does nt realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but does nt comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as petri dish nas far as seagal and his acting he rather boring nhe squints he kills nperiod nnothing else noh yeah there corny oneliners gon na reach out and touch someone nof course he the star and were supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and bunch of jerks nmichael caine who great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold nhe does it well guess but this is no alfie nof coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him nhis big henchman john mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible nand we even get small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid lee ermey from full metal jacket as hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego nand also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins nanyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagals movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really seagal movie nthey all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch ni mean if you do rent it and do nt reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minutes nbut have to put it to seagal for creating film so bad that the last film viewed with my uncle was pleasurable one nmy extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock
byou would think that this films dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of brilliant british comedy and americanizing it nyoud be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis nshould you ever happen to meet those chaps do me favor ngrab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking nhave you ever heard the phrase if it ai nt broke do nt fix it nthen walk away nthe film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistlers mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with nnow how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and ca nt even describe how the film explains it nthe point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble nproblems problems problems where to begin nfirst the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy nthen the song choices are totally uninspired good vibrations love nwow do nt put any thought into that guys nalso bean makes way too much noise in the film nthe character does nt speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean neach episode was like chaplin silent movie nin the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc its annoying and just plain wrong for the character nthe main problem though is that its just not funny nwith each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than minutes nmultiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease nthey even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series nsad and creatively lazy nas series mr bean only ran for about episodes or so nwhy on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything halfhour episodes certainly had nt exhausted all possible situations nall can say positively for the film at this point is that its almost appropriate for all ages if it was nt for couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things nand even that is nt very positive statement nplease guys go back to england and go back to television so you ll make me laugh again npg
bvampire lore and legend has always been popular fantasy element substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents nand unlike any of the more outlandish myths the vampire holds some realworld probability one study claims bloodsuckers exist worldwide and places in los angeles nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys john carpenter would like to remind us that they are and always have been truly frightening element of the thriller genre nand remind us he does in his latest film vampires nthere was some question as halloween weekend approached of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade released in august nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue and do nt even agree on some basic points of the slaying method for instance blades main weapons are silver and garlic whereas main character jack crows technique is wooden stake to the heart nblade also gives more of face to the vampire civilization while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate nboth have their advantages and here carpenters style lends itself to darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered nwhen its all said and done though the vampires still kill and die with bloody flourish the level for gore is indeed set to maximum nthis time our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow james woods nhes cynical battleworn veteran and the best of his bunch nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest and after exterminating nest one night they run up against supervampire termed master named valek thomas ian griffith nvalek kills all of jacks team except for his partner tony montoya daniel baldwin and as the two regroup they learn that valek is the original vampire now over six hundred years old napparently valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime nso with the aid of priest named adam tim guinee and bitten hooker sheryl lee as bait they track valek down for the final confrontation nthe script for vampires written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year ncrow in particular is fun source of oneliners and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism nbaldwin lee and guinee are all fine supports adding to the character pool but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy ngriffiths intense expression is perfect for the role and the only downside is that he got to talk sometime nluckily he got few lines and manages to pull off rather thrilling performance nall said fans will surely be impressed by this picture and those who found apt pupil bit limp will be excited by this one ncertainly worthwhile visit to the theaters
bwell heres distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually boxoffice hit at the time of its release nafter just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of enjoy this movie nit is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as had heard it was nat least some smut would have livened things up bit porkys tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid nwomen for the most part are mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from different planet ntheir plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to smarmy strip bar named porkys which they are able to get into using fake ids nafter they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers they are played trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building nfor these four teenage guys this means war on porkys porkys ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level nas teenage sexromp it is not wild or amusing enough nas comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat nas look back at the it is something suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in grave nand as revenge movie it is crushing bore none of the most offensive things about porkys is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers nthe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in preschool nthat sure is revealing information nthe female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark nthe women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people nfor example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of nmrs balbricker is gruff noholdsbarred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with coach and barks like dog nthere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating nto prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is compare it to other more serious films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison nany of the john hughes pictures such as sixteen candles or the breakfast club put porkys at an even greater shame nthose films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing nand heck if porkys wanted to be teenage sex movie take fast times at ridgemont high or the last american virgin over this any day of the week ndirector bob clark is not bad director ntwo years after he made porkys he directed the nostalgic holiday classic christmas story ni would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it was nt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay njust the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such piece of garbage and think that it was actually film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually whole lot funnier than anything in porkys
bwith the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately what with that whole clinton thing going on you know million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern oh please government waste my taxes just bit more would you nits about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement nwith this and crimson tide he created two successfully chilly films that are interesting exciting even pretty smart but never totally riveting as cinema and the problem think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart nthat film dealt with civil war inside nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them and was appropriately scary and all but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant enemy of the state is the same way its engrossing for its entire running time and its scary the way that it shows mans decent into kafkaism but its too technical nits too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be nit casts will smith one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he charming and witty and never uninteresting and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be person ni hate to do this but last years film the game got it damn perfect it casts michael douglas as deeply flawed human being man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life and then pulls everything he thought he had as security blanket away from him and watched what happened nthe result was not only film that was exciting and chilling but also the best mindfuck of the entire year nnot that want every kafkaesque film to be the game this years the spanish prisoner succeeds with less thrills and chills but it should be an example of what works and what does nt nwill smiths character is frankly too perfect at least too movie perfect nhe had an affair with another woman lisa bonet ha ha but his relationship with his wife regina king is basically fine regardless nhe has kid and he raking in money as lawyer albeit very good and reasonably moral one nso he generally does nt have any real problems as human being and is therefore boring except that he is played by will smith who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering men in black territory nhes good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he is nt great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities nsmith becomes involved in mass conspiracy involving the assasination of senator opposed to government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control when he is passed disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party nature observer played by uh jason lee nthe government wants the disk and is prepared to destroy his life to get it nas smiths plight is dramatized we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than speeding bullet nthese guys played by jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this film because they re well fascinating they re doing their jobs which are evil but the film does nt view them as such and they almost become our friends nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film does nt automatically judge them as the villains ntheyre also scary because we get the idea that they re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world nits as if they re obsessed with their jobs not because they re evil but because hey its fun job and no one else can do it like them nunfortunately this also backfires bit on the film instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on nsure you re chilled but you re not exacty freaked out by what going on nbut what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met fivesecond piece of film he ever liked nhes notbad director because hell he is always interesting to watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit days of thunder but the reason he not great is because he too technical and calculated nhis shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing to the imagination and they re always making sure you re paying attention nthis is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state to mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage to entertain without any real problems ndespite never actually becoming great its never actually boring and its always intriguing nwatching the government setup smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smiths likeable protagonist we are setup for good two hours worth of tom clancyesque entertainment nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos and you ve got good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smiths plight without minutes worth of boredom
bfield of dreams almost defies description nalthough its about baseball its not baseball movie nalthough the film is extremely spiritual its not about religion nand although field of dreams is melodramatic its not tearjerker nto really understand what field of dreams is all about you have to see it nin the film kevin costner plays ray kinsella baseball fan berkeley graduate and iowa farmer none day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields ray hears voice it tells him if you build it he will come nthen ray has vision and somehow concludes that if he builds baseball field in the middle of his corn shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again nand even though it depletes his familys savings and his neighbors think he crazy ray clears away the corn and builds baseball field complete with bleachers and flood lights if you build it he will come nand lo and behold shoeless joe does comebringing with him several of his dead teammates nand then ray hears the voice again it tells him to ease his pain nray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann an influential and radical novelist from the who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society nwith great aplomb james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on magical and spiritual journey nthe cast in field of dreams is excellent especially kevin costner in the lead role ncostner gives quiet subtle and moving performance as man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life ncostner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale namy madigan gives fine supporting performance as rays feisty and loving wife who against her better judgement supports her husbands crazy ideas nin her most impressive scene madigan vehemently argues against book burning at nmeeting displaying the sincere passion of berkeley radical nray liotta is appropriately eerie and aweinspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the chicago black sox scandal nand finally burt lancaster is memorable in small but important role as small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning nfield of dreams is touching fairy tale full of life wonder mystery spirit and humor nit for the most part succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief nray kinsellas spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous nbut while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama it unfortunately does at times go overboard and by the end it gets downright sappy nin general however field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasyone can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics
bi have never been so confused after watching movie meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season nat first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score nthen you ll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand what going on you ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in film like this nthe script is simply silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into three hour long motion picture nit feels like an eternity nmost of the time it is pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in high pitched voice and meaningful winks nthe film is based on alberto caesellas play death takes holiday nthe story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives fulfilled life as successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears voice that is saying yes nsoon he meets young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death nit is bills time nbut death has other plans nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive nour bill is chosen to be deaths guide and in exchange he gets time nbill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyones attention nbills business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bills side lives in his house and resides at his office nthat is not all however nbills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences nit would nt be fair to say that this film did nt have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bills family for dinner nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different nit is obvious that story like this story is very difficult to structure nits one thing to say would nt it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth nto create motion picture out of this is another nfour screenwriters have worked on script that lacks drive and logic nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as serious film non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and very decent direction by martin brest scent of woman nhopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from complete embarrassment nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time nhow can you play death in human form nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters nthey are not creatures but phenomenas nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form nhandling such ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work nspeaking in calm soft voice portraying death as lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than demon or redeyed executioner nclaire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery nin other words this is not what expected from the director of scent of woman nit could and should be better with such cast and crew nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on ravishingly looking soap opera
bwhen first heard about scream in was told that it was spoof of horror movies nfrom the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them by making the teenagers do what they know they re not supposed to do when serial killer is stalking them do nt run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say ill be right back etc nwhen first heard this description figured that it was an easy way out of making bad movie nhow hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually mockery of other bad movies nwas this wes cravens remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn nit just seemed cheap to me nthen actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and nailbitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude nscream is not only clever parody of your standard horror flick its also pretty scary movie nif you ve seen million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going to happen nthis is part of the fun of watching scream nthe movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent attractive teenagers nto those who rarely see these types of movies scream is thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as serious slasher film ntheres nothing wrong with that misjudgment though ni have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies to horror and the fanatics ntheir opinions on the film were so different but both very positive nfrom these varied reviews am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories nfilms that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream nthe low budget gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential film of the nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors nscream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quicklypaced script by kevin williamson nwithin the film are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of horror movie nmainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and you re dead meat nnot only are we treated these rules on plate but also the rules are referenced to number of different films and actors nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction nin this case williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement ni hear there is new movie coming out called scary movie which is spoof of scream which is spoof of scary movies ni will certainly see the film but have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety nhowever my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong nso who knows
bwell there goes another one nsadly this like other movies this year was nt good nthis one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite nfrom the opening credits had good feeling this would be bad and well guess was right nwith bad excuses for acting horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is terribly unfunny movie that does nt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give good performance nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date nhere is the stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship little bit up nhe really does nt realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants never did catch nso he proposes in really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie million dollars as nlong as he marries before the next day at pm nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves bad taste in our mouths nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs neven the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser are nt even good nthe plot was good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by five year old nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing do nt help things any neven though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even remotely good or funny performance here and wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him nrene zelweggar is different story and gave charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being total huge washout nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen nbrooke shields showed up in funny little performance as bigheaded mogul who after while became routine and old none really ca nt help but think that we have seen this stuff before nits not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness nthe bachelor works on no good levels and in fact does nt work at all ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career nchris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying great deal nhe seems held back and really does nt get into his character much and after even the first minutes gets annoying and old nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such cast in such bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is question only they will know nmaybe they thought it would become hit or critical success and sometimes do nt agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts nits based on the silent film seven chances which am sure is very better than this mess neven though some may think of this as good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back nbesides being terrible movie the bachelor is well terrible movie nit has nothing worth recommending therefore really ca nt recommend this movie ni did not have good time and laughed only three times nthe running time of the movie is minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time nbeing one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they give up on filmmakers
bearth is harsh unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets indian and pakistani muslim hindu sikh parsee nthe story takes place in lahore which was indian before partition and pakistani afterward regardless of what its citizens might call themselves nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny maaia sethna young parsee girl but it is really about her nanny shanta nshanta has small circle of male admirers ntwo of the men are suitors hasan rahul khanna hindu and dil navaz aamir khan muslim nthe otherssikh hindu muslimare older some are married but all appreciate shanta who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das she also starred in deepa mehtas previous film fire the first part of thematic trilogy which will conclude with water nin an early scene the men are sitting in park talking with shanta and lenny political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears none of the men remarks jokingly that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along nhe is wrong the men make barbed little comments to each other spoken like jokes but with an undercurrent of fanaticism nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses nit is easy to perceive in these squabbles the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter nthe group around shanta represents in sense united india and shanta herself the ideal motherlandone which all love which inspires hindu muslim and sikh to live peacably together nbut the circle around shanta is sundered as is the state na sikh is persecuted hides then flees nanother man is murdered nthe group of friends will not meet again nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction plate shattered on the floor stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child and most brutally when the tension escalates into violence man is held down tied between two cars and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles nit is visceral and effective metaphor for country which is being destroyed just as painfully nthe crux of earths plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion by hindus because they are muslim ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta and asks in desperation that she marry him nbut she loves hasan and tenderly refuses dil navazs offer nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality the muslim cause gives him motive to vent his anger and hate ndespite the things he later does it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things nthe conclusionthe consequence of dil navazs transformationis rather abrupt nthe story earth tells does not end nit just stops nit is an appropriate finish giving us closure would have imparted at least on an aesthetic level sense of resolution of satisfaction nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistanthey have been at war on small or large scale for decades nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of nation it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus nthere is no healing to be had no closure on any level despite the needless tackedon ending with voiceover narration from lenny as an adult framing the story nearth is in some ways an unexceptional movie nit does not reinvent the wheel following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas nbut deepa mehtas directon is assured and the issues she addresses run deep nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimous to live and tian zhuangzhuangs the blue kite did for china they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable even when flawed nthey may be biased or inaccurate but they bear the weight of human hardship and this confers on them nobility and gravity which other more inventive films often lack nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries the events shown may have happened decades ago but they still touch nerve nthe issues tackled in earth have particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year nin the near future india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other nat the time of the tests had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen after seeing earth have much much better understanding
broberto benigni is clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton nthis italian film star best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther has done the near impossible by creating comic fable about the holocaust nbut benignis life is beautiful la vita bella is not so much story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as backdrop to tell story of familial love devotion and sacrifice nthe movie starts out as typical slapstick farce with benignis guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in to fulfill his dream of owning bookstore nlike many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him most notably the almostforgotten harry langdon benignis guido has childlike innocence nhe ignores the growing antisemitism of the fascist government ninstead guido ardently falls in love and persues dora local school teacher who already is engaged to local fascist official nin benignis tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate yet slapstick encounter nguido wins dora nthey marry nfast forward about five years nguido dora and their yearold son giosue giorgio cantarini are happy family nguido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening bookstore nbut racial and antisemitic tensions are on the rise in italy and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities nthe task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to concentration camp nhere guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son but to keep him from being exterminated nit is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched nfor the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror the pain the unimaginable suffering of schindlers list ntrue many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over and most were not sent to the death camps but to work camps where they were used as slave labor nunlike steven spielberg benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust nhis story is about family and the lengths parent will go to protect child nfor guido to save his son transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game ngiosue must follow the rules without question to amass points nthe winner takes home tank ntherefore guido tells him he must remain hidden in the barracks nhe can not make sound nor allow the guards to see him nguido explains this during hilarious sequence when german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates nguido lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him chance to survive nthroughout their imprisonment guidos quick thinking continually keeps his son from harms way nultimately the allies rescue the camp nin poignant scene giosue comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound nthe boy goes wideeyed with wonderment and delight thinking he has won the game nthe price for his victory is most high nbenigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness nlife is beautiful is fantasy fable nit is not to be taken as record of the holocaust nthose who object to it are missing its point nand that is simply where there is hope where there is life and where there is love the spark of humanity will never be extinguished ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication

the last twelve years while bob facinelli is young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department nthese three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite nthe three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life nthe outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why nwhat comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make living nthese are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch ntheir dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical nfollowing in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high nin this case it is landing the big kahuna nthey each are trying to see why he on top and why they are chasing after him nwhat makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product nand how after each ones psyche is stripped clean by the other there is pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each nthe goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen nlarry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating sales pitch as part of their life nbob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in nbob is baptist who takes very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion nto just look at another woman and lust after her is sin according to the way he reads the bible nwhen asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and ca nt even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him nthe contrast in their personalities is stark nlarry is all business he simply wants to close the sale nhe comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being salesman nhe criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burnedout nhe tells him to go on vacation nget woman nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely life on the road for too long nhe now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in nhe has always been charmer shaking everyones hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale nlarry is more aggressive as salesman he is always heart attack away from every big sale nin contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him nthis is his first time for him on the road nwhen dick fuller does nt arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering nwhen told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account nbut when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus nbob then tells the boys about private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend nlarry and phil ca nt fathom how bob did nt make sales pitch nbut they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room nthese two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass nthe irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives nthese three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with marvelous performance nthe only problem with the film is that its more of play than cinematic experience nbut the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it good product to see

bbecause the press screening of planet of the apes was one day past last issues deadline was afforded the opportunity to see the film second time listen to audience reactions and read heap of reviews before writing this piece nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance that the story was thin that mark wahlbergs character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked nto those people would like to say what the hell did you expect nthis is tim burton movie boys and girls ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin clunky stories nfor the blissfully nasty disjointed and underrated mars attacks jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie burton reportedly tossed vintage mars attacks ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up nburtons reimagining of the story of an astronaut that lands on planet where apes rule men looks great nthe apes courtesy of makeup magician rick baker are dazzling and ape city is wonder to behold nlike astronaut leo davidson wahlberg the film hits the ground running whisking viewers through headspinning series of solid oneliners and engaging vignettes and establishing sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later nas for wahlberg consider what burton does with his character nfrom his start as filmmaker burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits peewee herman the joker ed wood the ackacking martians etc and lack of interest in standard issue heroes nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders nas for lack of color remember leo only launches into space to get his monkey back nhe does nt want to lead humanity and he is nt looking for romance from pretty but dull human estella warren or dynamic ape helena bonham carter terrific as an equalrights activist nas man who just wants out wahlberg is focused subtle and sly nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock and some more dandy visuals particularly of the approaching authority figures but admittedly is nt nearly as satisfying as the one in the original nfor the original ending to work we only had to make one simple connection for this one we have to write whole new screenplay nthe apes boasted handful of great scenes cool looking monkeys deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed redelivering classic line and killer ending nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of wrecking ball nthe planet of the apes offers different set of great scenes much cooler looking monkeys fine acting from wahlberg bonham carter paul giamatti and tim roth and not so good ending nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that nothing to complain about

blike good action film should metro has action that keeps you involved nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts the ghost in the darkness which opened few months ago is film that action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts to divert me it nearly put me asleep nbut metro is one of the best action films in while nit is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy neddie murphy was in bad shape for while nand this invites me to mention last year the nutty professor which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be metro happens to be lot better than any film in the beverly hills cop series nthat is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn prevent itself from having little fun neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people nthe beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as reckless wild cop always crossing the line by just an inch nin metro he plays hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble nhis character in metro takes himself seriously neddie murphy mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way nmurphy plays scott roper and as previously mentioned he is san francisco hostage negotiator nin the first tense situation in the film we are introduced to roper kind of work as he tries to calm down confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up nmurphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happygolucky misfit humor nthe film develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda jewel thief and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the cable car ncars flip ncars crash ncars turn over nand it is done so good in this film was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons nthere are also some other good scenes in metro that lot of films would rather choose not to have nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner few little methods of betting and winning nof course the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too nthose are the scenes that make up metro which is mainly about eddie murphy maturing as personality nthe actor that most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper new partner lipreading bookskimming genius and master of observation nit was not the actor presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of proclaimed genius nrapaport is an actor who usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit ni hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite joy to be able to see him in role like this feel that respect him more nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices nthe villain in metro is no more than device but he is darn good villain nonetheless nhe is played by michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in abraded rasp as if he smokes cigarette between every take nwincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death nand in addition wincott physical appearance and mannerisms in the film actually reminded my of an arrogant friend use to have who is no longer on my good list ni liked metro and do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also precursor to the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy growing as person now having family metro is nononsense movie nit works as buddy movie which it does not overplay nit works as dry comedy which it does not overplay nit works as suspense film which it does not overplay nand it works as an action film where it does have tendency to occasionally go allout nbut who cares nit still remains serious and it does not overdo itself noh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those nif there is one major objection had to metro it was the length an area where lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes metro is film that lasted little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something to do while waited for it to end npaul haynes

banastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases especially hercules nemotion nall the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences are nt going to hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together nnot since disneys beauty the beast has there been such compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works nthe story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the film nanastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced by christopher lloyd with her grandmother voiced by angela landsbury nbut anastasia gets lost and grows up with no memory of her royal origins nthe grandmother lives in paris hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution na young woman named anya voiced by meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying to put together scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money nthey pick anya to pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia ndimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov nthe plot is actually quite well structured nthere are lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later but it moves along fast enough that they ll never have time to be bored nwhat this really means is that the adults wo nt be bored by it either nthere is great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses nthere is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputins pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the film nhowever the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly nthe animation is gorgeous the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators nnot since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life to them neven without the voices they act nthe musical number in paris is showstopper with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style nas with all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top singers to get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits nthe songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but that so much fun its okay ni ca nt reccomend anastasia highly enough nits wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics nkids and adults alike will enjoy it and its also nice to have quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney

bits rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in single year but that is what disney and pixar animation latest film represents nwhile bugs life is nt nearly as deep as its predecessor dreamworks antz it is just as funny na bugs life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik nflik cutely voiced by newsradios david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task nwhen one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on mission too get him out of the way nthe offering is food that vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them nthe leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey nwhen the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food nwhen the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food nfliks mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return ninstead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors nwhen he returns with the warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes na bugs life has animation that is simply stunning nthe sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative ntogether with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film nits main weakness is that it could nt beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material
ball right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the bestselling story speechless is not based on the romance between presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin nin fact the script was in development well before nstill the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes critical difference nno its not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers its that carville and matalins story is actually interesting nspeechless is limp poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy nspeechless is set during new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep nwhat neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate nat first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer nbut there are plent of obstacles in the way including julias studreporter fiance christopher reeve and series of stunts which continue to prove that alls fair in love and politics nthe standard formula for movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other nscreenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism nits noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just does nt work npart of the fun of watching sparring in romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other and were left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already nthere is such herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue ca nt prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together nthe problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is wiseass ndavis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit nin couple of scenes like quiet moment sitting at fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection nfor the most part however they re just actors spouting lines nyou keep waiting for little spark and it never happens nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics nthe setting seems perfect for high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but that never the tone that underwood is going for nhe wants warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background nit might as well have been story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert kings previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so had some hopes for speechless nbut while there is wit in the words this is script which was probably much better on paper non screen its still paper thin

bin director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with legends of the fall and courage under fire nthose two films were nt bad just not very good but with zwicks latest film the siege he has finally made one the siege is modernday actionthriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city ninvestigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when city bus explodes with several innocent people on it nlater bomb goes off in broadway theater killing even more nthey soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist nthere are some movies that simply do nt need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them noh sure zwick thinks he is making meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis nthis time willis is horribly wasted as general of the army who puts state of martial law over nyc during the climax nwhatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place nthe role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenters vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys the siege contains three fine actorswashington bening and shalhoubbut washington is stuck with character that contains not an ounce of even remote development nbening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character nby the climax of the siege with washington giving sermon to willis on the socalled message of the story felt like had wandered into sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave minute speech at the end about preserving the environment the siege is constantly heavyhanded not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save film that lacks satisfactory screenplay
bpaul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what consider thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils nstarship troopers was essentially bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange great film that nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage nits not completely successful film but as failure its certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange have nt yet gotten around to seeing the th man or turkish delight ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop bleak superhero satire with robotic hero that as touching as schwarzeneggers in nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics nits violence seemed to be there for purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience ntheres jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with cop before snuffing him nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic nits startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just wo nt shut up he impales coworker drowns another and so on nbut why nhis character is introduced as smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull shift into psychotic movie monster nthe kind who just wo nt die nhollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who saddled with the films worst lines ve lost cohesion again ntheyre typical aaron spelling couple goodlooking but as vacant as george bushs republican national convention speech nbush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end nto what end nthis actually got applause nsuddenly warren beatty does nt look so absurd nthe rest of the films characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with series of strained oneliners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique nahh what cynical time we live in nas the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations project with the goal to make invisibility possibility for what purpose is never hinted at ntheyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in twist worthy of the films late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead nour mad scientist is turned invisible after several fxheavy complications then he inexplicably its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on human nbegins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow nlike the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days nits an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend saturday night with fun thrillaminute ride nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick nhow can one not have good time at film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self na couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friends and got into long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in serious manner to boot nbut oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway nverhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background nits plainly obvious that verhoeven is nt exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well nits funny that with all the technology million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks nin fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked nthe film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy nit happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted nits little moment in big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to plot that should have run its course by the apex of the mad slasher craze nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or still know what you did last summer nand they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as midweek bargain rental nyouve been warned nbut you probably wo nt listen will you ntis pity
bseen april at at crossgates cinema guilderland theater by myself for free using my hoyts critics pass ntheater rating very good seats sound and picture ndo you realize that every time you encounter new person you ve just become part of story neveryone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but part nevertheless nthat seems to be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble cast of characters that would nt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them such as teenage supermarket cashier bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors nthese types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by strip club bouncer and his psychotic father midlevel drug dealer narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing horny wedding guests zen lovemaker two shrimpscarfers and cute normal teenage girl to round things out nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with nid imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general nthe film starts out as anything else with little indication of what to come nwe meet ronna polley depressed los angeles checkout girl who does nt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent nshes not very charming especially to her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works nmaybe this is because she not very afeminite character but she far from masculine creative character indeed nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences nthis agreement starts threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nnearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we do nt think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players to the films makeup another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle nwhen the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene its clear this film is nt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling nconsidering how good it is up until that point its long overdue change of pace needed in movies today nand so the film begins to take shape first by following ronna and her friends on onenight adventure that begins with drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which does nt exactly go as planned but that what keeps it all so interesting nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead nsimon and his three friends head to vegas for night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined nthe third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from completely different angle nwere shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam are nt even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were nid really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who have nt seen the film nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due to plot twists or confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking nstill can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well direction trying to piece together such complex story is no easy task and for rookie filmmaker such as liman its great accomplishment nhe does nt just depict story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general its clear the script has been inspired by many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams ripoff tonemood where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre nits not overlydark or twisted and the comedy is nt so satirical for it to be considered black comedy more like macabre light cinematographyart direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture were able to get sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situations neven when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch performances every actor nails their role see above themetheory the film does nt seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages instead its more of philosophical experiment nin fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just big comedy and adventure see also the big

bsome movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have good time nplaying god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you its accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one ncongratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy whole lot of nothing nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed nthen there playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and bunch of ripoffs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet nharsh maybe njustified nhell yes nthis is movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes nfor example gunman bursts into garden with the two guns in his hands firing away nthis does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look njohn woo ntwo guns blazing nslooooow motion nand if that was nt enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in tarantino movie npoor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better nunlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things little different this time we get stupid heroes nexample duchovny manages to distract bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages nnow the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero term used as loosely as possible nsurvival instincts and good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds neven when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place finger near the trigger nmind you ve never fired shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not nsome will argue that our hero does not have killer instinct the hell with that ntwo fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second nsolution nboom nill take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much nanother prime example of the idiot hero syndrome nour boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her nhe knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of building and that he might be running into room full of people with itchy trigger fingers nhe still has his shotgun bring it along you say nno thanks ill just ditch it in the back of my car nand the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised nwhile we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door nive got no formal training but even know you never sit with your back to the door nask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to wall cost him his life nthis is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of hundred ways to make it better nis it so much to ask that hollywood actually put little common sense into their characters nfor instance nour heroes hide at duchovnys summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment nok this time our hero does get himself gun and has it at his side most of the time nbut see our hero is drug addict and guess what nhe chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt noh sure hell be really impressive when the bad guys come calling ngoing clean is really honorable of him but would have waited until did not need to be conscious or being able to fire gun nfor an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on nmoments

bi want to correct what wrote in former retrospective of david leans war picture ni still think that it does nt deserve being the number in the american film institutes list of the greatest american movies nand think that lumets angry men wilders witness for the prosecution and kubricks paths of glory would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in nbut ca nt deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents nthe film is set in burma in na bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai nbut the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers need nt work as simple workmen nstruggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect nafterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his mens morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese nbut the british high command sends few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins na flaw of the picture is the clich characterization of the japanese people nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building bridge nand the film does nt consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is somehow unpleasant person in the film nthe audience is supposed to applaud col nicholsons perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men the plot bypasses these risks nthat means the picture is nt perfect nbut it has lot of virtues as well nit shows the madness of war and what war can produce in peoples minds nit shows how col nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being hero and that others like shears get cynics nand the bridge on the river kwai is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an antiwar film despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ndavid leans effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates high suspense especially in the dramatic though not wholly plausible showdown nalec guinness does magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character nthe other actors deliver very good performances as well njack hildyards fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses karl rackwitz klein ris germany

the end of the affair is dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs nalthough its slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences moving experience nbased on graham greenes novel of the same name the film mainly follows characters ntheres maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry miles stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore nsarah finds henry to be bore because well he just normal guy nits all work and no play with him nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her nunfortunately the two break up nthis is all witnessed in serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present nits few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too nwhile this may sound straight forward its not nits deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love nall this may sound like drag but it really captures your interest nwith great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan neven though did nt read the book there no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive nwhats so moving about it you ask nthe tragedy of it all nits not the typical romance in which guy finds girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing nit really shows the complexity of relationship because nothing is ever perfect neveryone feels different way and that is what tears us to pieces nback to neil jordans script it was nt only red roses nthere were times when felt it too be little slow but most romances are nit also tended to be bit confusing especially at the start nit keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get grasp of things nalso notable was the superb direction by neil jordan nid have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly ve never really found his work to be up to par nit just never did anything for me until now nwhen it ends it leaves viewers little saddened but provoked nonetheless nthis is definitely one of the best films of and had some of the best acting most notably by moore nnot for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value
bm the sequel to mission impossible is james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value nit tries to be spyromance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses nit is film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human nthe coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols nthe film plays as if it was wet fantasy dream about techie violence nexcept for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for threequarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed nas for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen nm opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by computer virus at that point nthe only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way nits megabuck film adapted from popular hightech gadgetry tv series nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce story that had any substance njohn woo broken arrow faceoff is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks slomo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just ca nt seem to handle dialogue and suspense nthe star of the film and coproducer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast ncruise is no james bond and looks more like yuppie than superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an actionfilm girl and seems like fish outofwater in this one ntheir romance did nt work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it was nt convincing nthe film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that befuddled audience is its best bet for success nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville nfirst we are in sydney australia where scientist with muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it nhe also mentions that every hero needs worthy villain nwhich explains the films mythic theme as nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil nthe one who played the villain dougray scott does so in onedimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role nat least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense nsoon the diabolical scientist is on plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott rogue member of the imf which is cialike clone nhe steals the package with the antidote peels off latex mask which is replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted plot as that film had it was still superior film to this sequel nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense nnext we are in mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via rocket launcher pair of talking sunglasses nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running highgadget computer but he also must get jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team nhe is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped nhopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will selfdestruct in five seconds nactually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point nin seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of jewel heist and subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of mountain road nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be business deal and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to ck her nthe imf team then inject location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go ck him as she leads them to his hideout in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh nrobert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in camp way nthe terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning percent in biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first nethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds way to penetrate security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder seans getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on motorcycle using kickboxing winning shootout throwing full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kicks everyones ass nif was only entertained by this ncould have lived with it nbut this film was so badly made that it was like watching highlight film of basketball game seeing only the slamdunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast nin any case this is criticproof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into
bwith the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott sequel was inevitable nin fact after watching the first film sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer nhanding over the directors chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got facelift of immense proportions ninstead of being suspensescience fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created na film like aliens comes along only once in while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it ni never saw this movie in theaters but wish could have nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear naliens is an action film unlike any have ever seen nwith science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film nin fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine as the case may be nnever have we had more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about nplacing woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weavers presence woman is the only suitable hero naliens begins years after alien ended nlieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful nthey explain that colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left ndespite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and wo nt call the families back nhowever when the company loses contact with the colony ripleys story seems much more feasible none of the companys directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather team to travel to the planet nthis team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony narriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in cocoontype environment nthe only survivor is year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn nripley finds this chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newts surrogate mother nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as result the chills are incredibly heightened nthen again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator judgment day nhe is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion ni ca nt recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for moment njust when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again nwith seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen nusing flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety nof course for film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see naliens is completely realistic even decade after its initial release nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless with terrifying alien to go with them none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameronregular james horner nhorner has created terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work nnot only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes space odyssey which was mainly compilation of wellknown composers nin fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music nthe production design is incredible which also happened to snag nomination from the academy ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations nnormally film will be very dark in order to scare viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer nthen of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley nsurprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona nweaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for child developing threedimensional character from her quiet attitude nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids do nt always have to be flat characters njenette goldstein shows fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she is nt fighting nmichael biehn gives very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film nhowever biehn does good job making it seem original again npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however still see him as paul on tvs mad about you na very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others naliens is rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of suspensehorror film naliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality ncameron certainly knows how to make good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen ntechnically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed naside from this you probably wo nt experience anything like aliens for quite while
bthe premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding doomed airplane thereby cheating fate nhowever fate is not so easily bested and alexs friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances nessentially this premise is cleverway to make slasherflick without the slasher nunfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film nas far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many nthere is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite black humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick nunfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre nthe relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to setup the next death nthe scene where two of the characters break into funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue have witnessed nif you are looking for saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick nother than that wait until it goes into heavyrotation on cable
bterrence malick made an excellent minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel nunfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching hour long pseudoepic nthis is shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte nthe best scene is when nick noltes character lt col tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt staros elias koteas to execute an order nnoltes reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career nhad terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made truly great film ninstead malick saddled the film with plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and voiceover narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story nthe narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry nwith lot of editing the core story could be transformed into truly classic war film nhopefully the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the film ni give this film
bits no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between script and the actors involved often makes or breaks movie at the box office na poorlywritten script can be bested by superb acting corps and wellwritten piece can be mangled by group of amateurs nin directing his latest actioncomedy director brett ratner money talks takes relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into funny as all getout buddy cop movie nin addition rush hour serves as firstclass example of directing movie with conservative attitude feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types nthe two lead names share equal screen time here mostly because they spend it together njackie chan in his first completely american production makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts nthe other martial arts flick from few weeks ago knock off stands no chance against the content of this one nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise and there no doubt that large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who could nt believe their eyes the first time nchris tucker on the opposite side relates hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chans performance nhe works perfectly with the script and its quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf hand with some of his lines nalmost essential to the action genre the plot is nonexistent nwere quickly introduced to detective james carter tucker is maverick officer for the lapd ncut forward to another scene where the daughter julia hsu of the american chinese consul tzi ma is kidnapped by gang of swarthy characters nthe fbi is quick to the rescue but the consul insists that one of his men detective inspector lee chan be brought on the case to help nthe fbi resists but then requests that lapd send man over to babysit the chinese detective nits here that carter and lee hook up and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up nrattner does fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move step up but it does nt quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan this might be major drawback nalso some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride and others are there simply to look menacing nhowever none gives standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another whether its tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences and that contributes greatly to this being watchable movie for all types na recommendable visit to the theater indeed
bfor timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to multiplex and saw undercover blues ni would give it one half of star for guts nanyone in movie this bad would have to have guts ni later read ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show nthe script was the worst part nthey had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh nthey had lots of great sight gags like two people trying to go in door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door nturner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on game show nthe good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left nbuy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies ntell them the show is great and smile lot one of the top few films of this or any year na must see film excellent show nlook for it average movie nkind of enjoyable poor show ndont waste your money one of the worst films of this or any year ntotally unbearable nreview written on september nopinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employers
boctober sky is rare oddity in cinema selfproclaimed uplifting film that is actually uplifting nbased on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream nits and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there not much hope of rosy future ncoalwood is coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on football scholarship most of coalwoods boys are destined to work in the mine nbut in october an event happens that sparks one boy to dream nthe launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal to dream future of rocketry and space travel nof course homers parents chris cooper and natalie canderday are nt quite sure what to make of their sons unusual interests nhomer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of national science fair nand so with stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins to build rocket nbut do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny nthere is lot that could have gone wrong with october sky nnearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched nhowever miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times na film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness njake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film nfrom the outset of the film he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience nunfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick nthey remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here nof the adults in the film chris cooper is the most fully realized character nthe film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his childs dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn to realize what that is ndirector joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge nhowever there are still few occasions when he allows things to proceed just step too far nscenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial nhowever these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course nthe problem with many socalled uplifting films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat noctober sky never resorts to that level and yet manages to become truly uplifting film purely on its own merits
bkirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue nall he has to do is look at someone with raised eyebrow and you instantly know what he thinking detective story features one of kirk douglass finest performances nhe stars as new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night nthe film is based on play and this is quite evident as most of the movie takes place in the oneroom flat that the detectives work in nthe film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife but through series of events he never quite makes it there nthe bulk of the movie follows the case of man named schneider surgeon who routinely performs abortions with high fatality rate nhowever this schneider character has connection in the past of douglass wife connection douglas himself is not aware of nmany secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film nsecrets would not dream of giving away nwith name like detective story one would assume the film would resemble an episode of nypd blue but it does nt quite work out that way nhowever we do see douglas at work on few other cases throughout the running time nlee grant virtually unrecognizable plays meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting nher scenes with bendix another detective provide the movie with few laughs nthe performances all around are fantastic ndouglas may be the leader of this ensemble but he not the center of attention all the time nwe get to catch glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases nwhich brings me back to douglas nhe has really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him nwe can see that this is man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime but has finally realized that what he really done is gotten back at his criminal father nhow he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing nkirk douglas is the kind of actor we do nt seem to see to much of these days he tough guy but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior

bjoe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory nthe strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it nit has solid cast with tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles nbut you can never judge movie by its cast nif there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original nunfortunately it is also incredibly stupid nthe movie begins with joe tom hanks going to work nthis opening sequence is very boring and slow nit shows joe walking to his office nbut on the way he has to wait in long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting na sequence like this should take minutes nhere it takes over nit is obvious that joe hates his job nat his office one of his coworkers is meg ryan noddly enough she plays different roles in this movie njoe leaves to go to doctors appointment nhis doctor informs him that he has brain cloud nthis means that in few months he will die nso what does joe do nquit his job of course nwhen he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges ngraynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god nby startling coincidence the boat trip to the island takes few months nby the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees ngraynamore gives joe credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this great adventure njoe goes on date with meg ryan his coworker nthe day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamores daughters nshe is also surprise meg ryan nexcept she looks more hippyish nthey both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over to his boat nthe lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamores daughters nand wonder of wonders she is also played by meg ryan nas they sail to the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have craving for orange soda nafter some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to nand that the brain cloud thing was made up nthey do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage njoe goes fishing and catches hammerhead shark nthis is cheap gag that has been pulled off many times nbut to top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake none night there is storm na cheaplooking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard nfortunately joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail nby pure luck they get to the island nsince the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire nstupid or what before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed nright before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not to nwhen joe decides to she goes in with him because she loves him nnow this is where the movie should end nbut unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in nthe volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joes luggage nthey float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers ni give this movie nsee it only if you re film buff that enjoys bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan

ban energetic visually stunning but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne darc nin history jeanne darc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors who can basically alter the story as they wish nshe came in time where people desperately needed saint na hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness ndirectorwriter luc besson nikita leon portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft nbesson tries to recreate the person behind the legend nhe tries not to show her as saint or villain nhe shows her as human being nin time where blood was almost pouring from the sky and the air smelled of rotten flesh it is hard to keep your sanity nthe only support and hope is in god nat the age of jeanne milla jovovich watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers nthis terrible event makes lasting impact on jeannes mind ngod is no longer her support nhe has become her obsession nshe starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny nwith the help of the wise yolande daragon faye dunaway and charles vii john malcovich whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls nafter this the film stays mostly on the battlefield where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences only occasionally resorting to calmer tempo nthe movie is filled with dreamy symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship that create surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere nthe film is lost in time and space hysterically jumping back and forth in jeannes thoughts imagination and conscience nbessons visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle nbut the film is far from being flawless nthe script needs lot of polishing nexcept for jeanne there are no real characters nand although grand star cast is assembled their characters are nothing more than props not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing nas for the maiden of lorraine herself she is portrayed as simple girl too small for her divine task nin the latter part of the film we see her as hysterical confused and on the brink of madness with her past purity and innocence for ever lost njovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect nbut though her screen time is incredible excessive both malcovich being john malcovich and dunaway titus surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance nand even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part nbesides casting jovovich bessons only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting nthere are some viscously evil englishmen that murder pillage and betray with smile on their faces nand some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen represented by the three musketeers of this story the brave gilles de rais vincent cassel the wise aulon desmond harrington and the strong la hire richard ridings nthough all those actor perform well their characters are nothing more than symbols banners that proclaim the glory of france nand thus there is no sense of realism in this film nthe messenger has muscles instead of brains nthere is some relief in the end where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking ndustin hoffmans appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with climax worthy of praise njeannes character is unlocked but whether god was in the picture or not is never quite explained nwas she confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge nor was she truly messenger of god nthe film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious nbess messenger is nothing more than fairly good film nit is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater nmaybe the sound the dreamy sequences but certainly not the dialogue nit is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtvgeneration that although presents some interesting material works better when its on the battlefield
bi must say from the outset that have never been much of kurt russell fan nive seen some of his films silkwood backdraft unlawful entry and while he gave adequate performances have never been impressed with his work nbreakdown then is something of surprise nrussell gives fine performance as do most of the cast one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film nto say that he holds the film together would not be completely true but he does it no harm nrussell plays jeff one half of married couple travelling with his wife amy kathleen quinlan cross country to san diego to start new job and new life nwhile journeying through the desert their car breaks down and left helpless and stranded jeff waves down passing truck driver nwalsh who offers to take them to nearby diner to call for tow truck nbecause of nasty incident earlier with couple of ruffians jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help nthat it seems is the last time jeff or anyone else sees her nbreakdown has been compared to several movies george sluizers the vanishing the original hopefully not his appalling hollywood remake steven spielbergs duel and any number of hitchcock films nas with these breakdown does not for the most part stray down the conventional path of the american actionthriller njeff does not become guntoting vigilante on the hunt for his wife but instead becomes scared confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on nwhen we do find out what has happened to amy it does come as slight disappointment if only because its too early in the film for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment but this affects the film little nrussell as mentioned earlier is very good in his role and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo nj nwalsh as the possibly evil truck driver is terrific he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood does nt seem to know what to do with but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here nthe reason he makes such great villain is that he actually looks like real person one anyone would be able to trust which makes the plot that much more believable nbreakdown is what hollywood does nt make enough of great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do indeed have viewers on the edge of their seats none of the most genuinely exciting films ve seen in long time

bin tim burtons sleepy hollow there is mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name nhe rides beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe nburtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror nwriter andrew kevin walker seven throws in perhaps too healthy dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine nas sleepy hollow opens were greeted with juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burtons ed wood nlandau plays prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate nlandlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is dead hessian trooper played briefly by wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods ncrane is not man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things was not surprised to find in tim burton movie nfirst and foremost sleepy hollow is fun horror film nas with virtually all burton movies we are treated to wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly nthe horseman fx are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors nbut why did enjoy sleepy hollow as much as did nalthough enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right nit was the light comic touch that burton applied nthe film has the sweetness of candy apple usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities nthis is certainly not the only alteration that been made nas the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience its not an issue we particularly wish to be solved nits more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive nstill we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye to capture our attention nthe costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout its recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent nwalken michael gough who appeared in burtons batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles ni suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy nall of this is not to be taken seriously of course nsleepy hollow is lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of classic tale that many people cherished as children nif you ve got decent head on your shoulders you ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time
blabelling is sometimes everything nin original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors nproducers were nt thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones non the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america nto make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia years ago ninstead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city nthe gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx nthat is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce non the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city ncrowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus npolice simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs nthe remaining eight led by cleons lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs nupon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of cult status nhowever despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year nthe reason for that probably lies in fact that this movie aged very quickly nif walter hills idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably nthe future was much worse than his vision nthe youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime nin their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns nthey even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had lot arguments in their favour ndespite those objections the warriors have all the elements of very good film nthe plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there is nt much bloodshed or gore in the movie nediting is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable nyet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity nbest known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains nmichael beck as cool almost statesmanlike leader of gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot nall in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies
blate in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy nthe film is multimillion dollar testament to everything artificial nfilled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster nprinze plays college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman coed nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of outdoing the previous in how cute it can be nthe happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out song because as prinzes dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love nthen in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart nwhy nwell because they have to notherwise the couple ca nt make up and live presumably happily ever after ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to goat nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well nstiles best friend rosario dawson is pot head prinzes roommate shawn hatosy is girl crazy fool who ca nt meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film nyou know the average porn star nthe costume epic idea gives him reason to appear in different ridiculous outfit everytime he on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be couple of stupid sex jokes nshe is porn star mostly so we know she slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted nattempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include pregnancy scare and the big break up nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes nwhat happened here nthe cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places nwriterdirector kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off nin fact the whole film feels like reworking of last years extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences nthe direction is filmschoolgrad obvious nits stylish in hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion nplus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera nthis is the second film in row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she all that nif he does nt start making better choices fast his future films wo nt be so lucky
the world on land its just too big for me nstarring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii nrated nthe legend of is the years most absurd movie rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast nit stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as guy named nyou heard right nhis name is in all actuality nhe was born on an ocean liner on uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny ship crewman spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of dannys fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters nwell when is about or so he starts wondering all around the ship none day he discovers grand piano nhe sits down and starts playing nmiraculously what comes out is beautiful na group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such young age nwhen one of the people who knows tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations replies ck the regulations nho ho ho grows up never setting foot on dry land nwhen he about ish and can play the piano like nobodys business onboard comes another musician nhis name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet nafter catches max barfing everywhere during storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the pianos braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it nhow the chair they re sitting on and the piano do nt separate do nt know but this apparently is nt the kind of thing were supposed to ask nafter that and max become friends nmax is determined to get off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but has no intention of doing so nwhats more he does nt even want his music to go anywhere without him when record company hears about his talents they come on board to make record of his music but after finding out that gasp they re going to make millions of copies he breaks the record nthe conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon record of music in store nthe record should nt exist because never stepped on dry land and the one record that was made on the ship was broken nladies and gentlemen its mystery nthe story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements nwere supposed to be roused by climactic npiano duel nthere is nt anything in this movie with the potential to compel comes off as whiny brooding extremely unlikable man ca nt recall single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life nditto for max who does nt seem to have life outside his friendship with ntim roth plays with about as much panache as fig leaf there no spirit no gusto to the character nhe insists that he leads happy life on the ship but to us he is dead npruitt taylor vince is little more palatable at least providing moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up bit nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges to the aforementioned piano duel nthe legend of was made by giuseppe tornatore whose cinema paradiso is considered masterpiece by many nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless nat once ridiculous boring narrowsighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten
jaws is rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you single image on screen nthe movie opens with blackness and only distant alienlike underwater sounds nthen it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score ndahdum nfrom there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on midnight swim with beautiful girl that turns deadly nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip nperhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie nhe works it like theatrical production with first act and second act nunlike so many modern filmmakers he has great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act nuntil then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music nhes building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying nhe does nt let us get bored with the imagery nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there has nt been murder or gun fired in years nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton does nt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money nbrody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark its perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying nwhen vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is thriller with keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror nit is like ten movies all rolled into one and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in by star wars neven today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks psycho and it never seems to age nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects nscheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nnevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark nscheider hits just the right notes as sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town its your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him ndreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz gives surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers nhowever most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards nbordering of parody shaw plays quint as grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism nhes slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost caricature nhowever there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the nindianapolis navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese nhis tale of floating in the water for more than week with over other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen nshaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film nof course we ca nt leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature na shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are threat nevery one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into nthe shark in jaws was actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles nmany have forgotten but jaws was sort of precursor to waterworld movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about bomb nbut as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood
btoday war became reality to me after seeing screening of saving priivate ryan nsteve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production nthe audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war nplease keep the kids home as the rating is for reality ntom hanks is stunning as capt john miller set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home soldier private ryan matt damon who lost three brothers in the war nspielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes nprivate ryan is not for everyone but felt the time was right for movie like this to be made nthe movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women nwe must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice their lives so that we may live in freedom today nfor this thank them and for steve spielberg for making movie that will never forget nthe academy will not forget tom hanks come april as another well deserved oscar with be in toms posession
bas forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times nbut alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber nits amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything nthe whole point here is how could man be so blatantly forgetful nthis is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is professor nwell this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded nalong the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber nthankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience nthe flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have life of its own nthis is there strictly for the kids nthe properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs nalthough amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone nthe poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible nadmittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor nthe whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable nthe basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning nthis just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film chance nas for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie ngiving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that its best forgotten and prof brainards flying robot weebo ngiving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it was nt for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in bit of music and extend the length of the movie nthe life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it was nt and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good nnow weebo is totally different story nits robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of life too nthis is really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie nyes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters nthe film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all nthe acting by robin williams prof nbrainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced nmost of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to npeople when stood up at the altar do nt usually give third chances nor for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is childrens movie nflubber as movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect nwith the best character in the movie being something of prop doubt that many people will find it all that great nit does have its amusing moments and it is good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original nkids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie nas movie its just kids movie and not the best of ones at that

goodman greg kinnear mike nichols ndo any of these names make you instantly shudder nthe answer would have come up with before today is no this is quite list of talented individuals we ve got here ngranted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like smile like yours but even so they ve got proven power as excellent supporting players ngarry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show nand for gods sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty nso explain this nthis nthing nwhat planet are you from npurports to be comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon nbut what this movie winds up being is collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringeinducing thoroughly icky embarrassment ngarry shandling plays an alien from planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course nhis leaders put select group of males through series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find female of the species and impregnate her ntheyre taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying uhhuh and how to compliment shoes nimagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably producing comedic results nthe lucky winner is fitted with penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence ni will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clones nwhoops too late nthe penis when aroused tends to make humming noise nthe writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend to turn to this as source of comedy nit is nt funny the first time nit is nt funny the eighth time nit is nt funny the eighteenth time nif anything it made me feel vaguely selfconscious ngarry meets up with coworker at bank played by greg kinnear who turns out to be generic unlikable scumbag nhes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character but he so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside nkinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks nwow nwhat magnificent bastard nnearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball nwhen kinnears wife walks into the office there is nt single guy who does nt trip bump into wall or otherwise pratfall as if they never seen woman before nthe few guys that are nt particularly slimeballs such as john goodmans detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics nshandling meets up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnears aa meetings nshandlings mission is to have baby and when he reveals his desires to her bening instantly falls for him and the next day nthey get married nyup nthe next day ncuz ya see it turns out she wants baby too nbenings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty nif her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as whole then woe say to the species nshes unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic ntheres point where after thinking she may not be able to bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant nwhen garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then says to him now you ca nt leave me nwere supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of great big nothing nand eventually shandling falls in love with her nfor real suppose though not sure exactly what prompted it nwhats the message derive from all this nmen are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough nwell maybe something will click nha ha nha nim thankful such broad cynicism is nt frequently allowed to run so rampant nlets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one ntheres also subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity ngoodman through series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is being from another world with magic vibrating penis nit has all the makings for subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition ninstead it just dangles limply on the branch for while withers and falls away nfurther proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies nbut lets not dwell on this any longer ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own nlets move on forget about what we ve seen here and get on with our lives nand to help us out lets end things on happy note ncongratuations go out to annette bening winner of this weeks title naward for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name

bwhen left the theater after seeing david lynchs lost highway remarked to fellow moviegoer feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears nin his first feature film in five years lynch delivers film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale nyou wo nt know what happened when its over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it ni can however describe what we see on the screen jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep nthey are naturally enough more than little frightened and confused and it does nt help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving nthe next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again blonde who is otherwise renees spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man ni would be giving away little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch does nt offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end nthis description might make lost highway sound like giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynchs weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time non the contrary lost highway is dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynchs previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther nthe film does not revolve around character investigating mystery rather the character is the mystery nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goingson here nwe the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably freds in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent nall of this proceeds appropriately in lynchs typically slowpaced idiosyncratic style nas is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on freds blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coils song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present vivid picture of man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity nlynchs direction and director of photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve to create nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story nwell most of the time anyway have to admit that was bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewers attention because of its tieins to the original mystery nthe main characters in this reality dayton wellmeaning but none too intelligent yearold sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much stock character and his pornstar girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you could nt find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the films spooky unnerving tone during this stretch nlynchs typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here nits not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off nthat said these minor flaws do nt prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years nit is oneway ride down the lost highway of disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective
bthe release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen kings work nthis slowmoving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals but suffers from tepid conclusion inconsistent direction and may not have wide commercial appeal nwhen the maid dolores claiborne is found brandishing rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer it seems like an openandshut murder case nupon hearing of the death via mysterious fax dolores estranged and bitter daughter esquire magazine writer selena st george returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home nas the two clash horns the story behind the mysterious death of dolores abusive husband two decades ago ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey is revealed ndid dolores kill her husband nand did she kill her employer ndolores claiborne is certainly more of character study than suspense thriller nconsequently it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywoods finest character actors such as bates leigh and strathairn nkathy bates plays the films title character and gives sensational lead performance ndolores claiborne is essentially showcase for the talent of bates as her character has huge amount of screen time nshe dominates the screen producing character that is compelling and arresting as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks nkathy bates performance is awardcalibre stuff nthe rest of the cast is also very good njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour bitter helena st george well and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores everpresent nemesis the determined detective john mackey ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores husband joe st george njudy parfitt is fine as dolores tyrannic socialite employer vera donovanit would have been interesting to see say meg foster in this role nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences she is very impressive nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right to parts which are embarrassingly hokey nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hitandmiss in terms of effectiveness nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up nhowever the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderfuli particularly like the chilling iceblue hue permeating the presentday scenes contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shotsand danny elfman provides surprisingly understated score for the film nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as big draw and its pacing may be turnoff to those expecting gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axewielding psychopaths nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand ndolores claiborne suffers from very unsatisfying conclusion and moves very slowly nhowever the performances are uniformly excellent particularly kathy bates and the film has its moments non my fourstar scale give dolores claiborne three stars

btone alone can not sustain film but it can go long way nif can find myself lost in the time and place of story it scores immediate style points nwhen that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective do not use lightly literary nwhats eating gilbert grape nis such film nits rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence ngilbert grape johnny depp is young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities nas the man of the house since his fathers suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down nas he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing nslowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people ndirector lasse hallstrom my life as dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel nendora is town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real nminor characters like crispin glover as the towns mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgens desperately unhappy housewife none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the offkey high school band nnot single note in the depiction of endora rang false nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert nits testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilberts description of his father with knew someone like that once ngilbert is man harboring an evergrowing bitterness about where he finds himself in life bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty nin one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like side show attraction nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnies repeated chants of were not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his fathers footsteps in this regard njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to onedimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands ndepps performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprios astonishing oscarnominated supporting work as arnie nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hardpressed to spot flaw ndarlene cates firsttime actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilberts tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilberts sisters nonly juliette lewis does nt quite click playing critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me nthanks to lovingly created setting and marvelous cast this release proves well worth the wait
bmaybe the most important thing about this movie is that its not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month because it very well could have been manipulative tearjerker broadcasted on abc on monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively nbecause its not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why its so great nunderneath the todiefor cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction is film of modesty not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it tell it in certain original way nit does nt merely go from plot point to plot point nit goes from character to character nit obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all and makes the story of worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters both musicians who have totally unique relationship nits that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional and real nin short this movie is just awesome nit merely tells its story really well and that something that just has to be commended these days when most stories are botched because they re not told by great storytellers ndirector anand tucker tells this story well nhe overdramaticizes everything but still keeps it real nthe film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr rachel griffiths and emily watson respectively two sisters who are first seen in childhood played by auriol evans and keely flanders respectively as the very best of friends nthey are also both musicians hilary flutist and jackie cellist and when it all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary is seen as the better of the two njackie bit jealous works and works at her playing skills and soon the tables are turned nwhen they both hit adulthood hilary strives for comeback while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world but instead of fame captures the heart of hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey in semistarmaking turn nthey marry after short courtship and move to lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes symbol of her current life when she plays she has the eyes of the world but when she stops she alone nshe enters into shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain in hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins to lose it and runs away to hilarys country home where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure nits all terribly melodramtic as you can see and by the time jackie has contracted ms in brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar shine in technical and emotional devastation it would have been the time that could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it had nt been handled in such way nthe key thing here is that its not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that its about her tumultuous relationship with her sister which might add is perfectly realized ntheir relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world but they re also completely jealous of one another nwhen young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries in vain to make comeback but ca nt and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success nwhen jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry wonderful man she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that ve ever seen in film only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man nand the whole time their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested nanother thing really liked is emily watsons performance ni usually make it note to never overpraise an actor for playing either drunkard or lunatic or someone with mortal disease or any combination of the three nmy reasoning for this is that its fucking easy job nthe worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in beloved sure she good but what so tough about playing woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like three year old inside year olds body nhell could play that if had pair of breasts nin that same exact movie though is performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never to be seen again and her mothers lover is scared off nshe has to actually deal with real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about nbut the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons nif you do nt believe me look at jack nicholsons performance in as good as it gets great performance but easy job nthis is nt so for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just plot point nand thanks to the opening sequence where we see her and hilary as kids we understand the motives behind all her actions and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life we ve already understood that this is the last straw for woman plagued with terrible neuroses nrachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy to watsons protagonist actually matches watson stepforstep because as watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her ngriffiths an otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer is absolutely brilliant just as absolutely brilliant as watson is and if the academy and all the other critics groups who ve already deemed watsons performance the best of the year glance over hers because she the one who does nt get to go insane read she gets the boring role then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me nafter all griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real the tom cruise role in rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman nshe does and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year its griffiths ntogether the two actresses work extremely well though and both have to go through deep emotional hell the likes of which have nt been seen this year nif it had nt been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety say this is one of the top ten best films of the year nits so close to perfection in its structure its treatment of its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without shred of doubt in my mind and maybe film editing that its nearly shame that its not the flawless gem that it should be nbut hey as it is can hardly complain
bi remember making pact right after patch adams to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality nbut darn it music of the heart is just layered with feelgood material and bright characterizations nits hard to dislike movie that uses such skill with its manipulation nin addition its also terrific family film nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in handful of inner city harlem schools nit could also be described as mrs nstreeps opus nyes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad nout of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult to identify with robertas character and grasp her academic pointofview nshe is very strict with her students but what insight does that create into the story nslowly but surely we begin to recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied none thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the directors chair horror veteran wes craven nafter leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street craven has attempted precarious crossover to drama nat first his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious but as the film progresses craven finds surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material nit does nt carry the heartwarming courage of mr nhollands opus but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate nyes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but its the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially does nt hire roberta because of her lack of experience nblueeyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing new love interest ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of supportive secondgrade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce flaming fireball of estrogenic force nits like schoolteachers version of thelma and louise in restrained but effective manner nthe movie tackles more issues than just guasparis teaching of violin ntheres some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman nin its dramatic buildup the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth nits good movie for anyone to see although missing out on the experience would not be lifealtering decision nits commendable of wes craven to be attempting such difficult crossover and also for achieving his intricate goal nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed scream nof course when the third installment of that series comes around in february with craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed music of the heart nmission accomplished wes nthankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film nin its entirety its wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par even if some of their problems are clich and predictable in the extreme nthe mother who does nt want her son to be learning white mans music the unexpected casuality nbasically everything is there nit does nt strike the perfect chord but music of the heart is highly convincing nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals

byour first clue that something is nt gon na be quite right with the movie you re about to see its heavily christmasthemed and its release date is oh say at the end of february nyour second clue that something is nt gon na be quite right with the movie you re about to see charlize theron one of the movies dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in which when asked if her new movies any good she replies with the equivalent of verbal sigh nassuring us that yeah it sure is movie all right nand there some scenes like those you expect to find in movie and there some action nand there other nstuff ntoo nhow to immediately grab my attention open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits nthen show caption reading six days earlier nya know was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas nhow to immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene with terminally dull niceguyswhodontdeservetobeinprison scene nwrite line for the one of prisoners like just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad nthen have ben affleck actually say that line on film and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor nfor good measure throw in poorly motivated prison riot and have afflecks best buddy stabbed naw nand just two days before his release too nalready the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours nhow to take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability to think nhave ben affleck for some reason ill never understand pretend he his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played by charlize theron nhave gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in poorly planned casino heist nthe villains big idea nkidnap affleck because he used to be security guard at the casino force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place non paper it seems like the stuff of potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he looking at the makings for some sort of clever actioncrime thriller nits not like the man is nt capable nfar from it nhes the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may nhe wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ve ever seen in last years ronin nbut he certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers nput reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his version of the island of dr moreau nstep one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the worlds most generic hero nhe gets no good oneliners he does nt get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as car thief and wants cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie nhis name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood nsee its called reindeer games nget it nget it nshut up nin the past affleck has been at his best as supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as leading man nstep two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinises villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook filmmaker could have some up with nhes dirty and pottymouthed he got long scruffy hair and goatee and fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them nhes also extremely inept at what he does nhe thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts afflecks character to pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him nbut instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems to think he playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script non side note gary sinise wins this weeks title naward as he the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings nlast weeks winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards nhow to take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely nthis is bad movie nand what worse is that except for few moments near the notsostunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad nif they done that much at least would have been entertained
love is the devil is challenging film munundating its audience with wild imagery and plot structure that disallows plot perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artists psyche rather than the artists lifeline nwatching it was enthralled with the look of the film the way the director shot everything like it was looking through bizarre personalized filter neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the films subject looked at it personally nbut while was engrossed stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film awakened from my trance by some inner distraction and began to try and follow what going on nexactly what was looking at nwatching this film was nt sure if it was the most insightful film had ever seen or the most vacuous ndirected and written by john maybury love is the devil is stylish masterpiece for the senses neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing nthe camera angles are ferociously askew and the closeups are uncomfortably too close nthe editing is deft occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding on shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs or rather intruders to bacons world and psyche nas such there is no real story nive not heard much about francis bacon that did nt read prior to the film but what learned was this he was painter in england who reached his peak during the and drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet and in interviews he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi he like foppish and selfabsorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero nhe lives life the way he wants to live it to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him nits as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself champagne for my real friends and pain for my sham friends he says one night at the bar he frequents love is the devil chronicles the latter part of his life nbacon wellknown in his midlife awakens one night when he hears man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor nhe walks in unafraid of what he finds and discovers thief george dyer daniel craig nbacon gives him an offer if he spends the night with him he can take anything he wants in the morning ngeorge agrees to this and off to bed he goes but ends up staying with him for whatever reason nthe film shows their lives together at least in reference to one another nwhile creating bacons world of friends like high art this film minors in showing certain group of people who radiate connection that is not shown but is understood the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant nbacon is haughty and bizarre george is simple and does nt understand bacon in the least especially not his paintings nwhile watching this that basically all thought was there nthe film has hypnotic feel free of any restraints of form and is shot so uniquely that felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about nonce the film is over its easier to piece it together ni kept on thinking about this film wondering what the point to all of it was nsomeone does nt merely make film of all style and no substance at all and if they do they do it by accident but still allow some substance to creep in nthinking about it remembered how the two fed off of eachother ni thought about how bacon was masochist in love with cruelty in one scene he watches boxing match with orgiastic delight and lets out squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxers head splashes across his face in another scene he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisensteins battleship potemkin and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain nhe drove him over the edge and for him that was love even if it was nt for george ni guess that explains the title na bit nthats great and all but almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning ni wish it had nt reduced itself to making some point about humanity about how love is the most selfish thing in the world and it is if you look at it certain way nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one mans twisted pysche nits almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one mans uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audiences throat nthat way you do nt reduce your film to something its just not ni ca nt say totally enjoyed love is the devil though ndespite all of the things respect about this movie its still rather uncomfortable to sit through neven at normally trite length of ninety minutes the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through especially after an exhausting first hour nthough hypnotic it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times as if it were taking advantage of one mans truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it nas such respect the way the film looks nits beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that along with what dreams may come and dark city its the years most visually stunning film nin fact if better script had been forged almost compare it in visual power to peter greenaway film complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever nand with dymanite performance by derek jacobi it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just hair bit of substance nthen would have had something to hold me over even now
bseen at the st portland international film festival nfilm title supermarket woman director juzo itami country japan cinematography yonezo maeda music toshiyuki honda cast nobuko miyamoto masahitko tsugawa shiro ito yuji miyake akiko matsumoto super features typical itami film nfunny and pointed in its own way nif you do nt care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket then this film is not for you nmaybe it is better to ignore it as this strong and biting satire as only juzo itami can deliver will give you an insight as to what some foods go through nhaving in the past made films that pulled every punch imaginable from the family traditions the funeral to taxes taxing woman taxing woman returns to the diabolical gangsters minbo to hospitals the seriously ill juzo itami this time takes on the supermarkets own war to get the consumers nand while this film has its funny side in the crazy situations that it creates it also shows another side which is very much the attitude of corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer ngoro has supermarket nand competitor comes into the neighborhood trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket nbargains galore its name has in mind the closure of goros humbler venue so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can ngoro hires hanako housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management than they are in anything else nhanako as she gets familiar with the operation discovers many of the tricks of the trade done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market nand the procedures are not always fresh food but new packaging and new date to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves nhanakos ideas take hold starting with few of the women that work in the supermarket being that they do not even shop there at all nand hanako discovers along the way that few giveaways here and there make bit of difference nif not cause some serious problems in the running of the store na price error forces them to give away eggs for very low prices and causes the store few hassles but it brought the people in and everyone knows that these customers will buy few other things nas the operation gets stronger the competition also has trickery up its sleeve and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors neventually these people are found out and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully until in the end they all have showdown nand here the truth and honesty win out and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent nin the process they also find that freshness with some very funny jokes on this word as well becomes much more important tool than they imagined nwith some very nice performances in this hectic and fast paced film this film gives us sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways although failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much even though towards the end it is suggested nbut this would take away from the satire and its strengths nwith food gags all over the place the film lets you have it nand what fun it is nworth seeing editorial the director of this film juzo itami died shortly after the film was finished and he left behind legacy of comedy and satire that is rare and uncompromising nwe would wish that he had been able to make one about film making of which he must have had few stories to tell but we will have to do with much of the japanese society and its many errant ways nnot to say that these things do not happen anywhere else namerica is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all should anyone have the guts to tackle it nwe could learn something along the way too nworth seeing specially is taxing woman and its follow up taxing woman returns nthe funeral is also good although not as funny as the later films ntampopo is also very enjoyable nall four of these films are available in video which means your best local site for foreign film may have them nask for it
brobert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible godgiven gifts but are able to act like ordinary people nin the natural he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like humble farm boy nin butch cassidy and the sundance kid he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like nothing more than boyishly goodlooking charmer neven in indecent proposal where he played man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting tale of lost love nin his latest film the horse whisperer based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such character nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in movie suppose the character of tom booker man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having purpose in life nbookers talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in horrible accident nthe accident which is filmed with gutwrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker nat first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that does nt work ninstead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sisterinlaw diane dianne wiest nin many ways the film is like journey both literally and symbolically nthe move out west has always been great american tradition of renewal and its hard not to see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as variation on the classic theme of city vs country nin the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annies controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed river runs through it six years ago nin many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains nbut then that would ruin the magic nmuch of the films photography is truly elegant and it creates palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land nto further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and more squarish aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting and the screen widens to aspect ratio nin terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans brief encounter and clint eastwoods adaptation of robert james wallers the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese coscreenwriter here also adapted bridges nalthough the horse whisperer has strong romantic sensibility still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who being left behind for this brief heartsweeping affair but there rarely is nin the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill nhe plays the character as decent hardworking man who is good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be normal fairly uninspiring man nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character nit shows booker and robert going into horse pen booker is dressed like classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in baseball cap nas they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in goofy moment forgets to close it behind him nits small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness nafter all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it nthe best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse nalthough bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true nat some point wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nnevertheless redford is obviously romantic at heart and he brings light touch to the erotic moments in the film nthere are no dramatic sex scenes but there is moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission
bwolfgang petersens latest the perfect storm is like pineapple nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all its going to hurt quite bit nok maybe that was confusing analogy so heres my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there is nt really much of story to tell nbasically massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story nnot nearly enough nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous naudiences want to see the storm they want to see fight for survival but what they get is lot of cliched maudlin drivel nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first threequarters ni have yet to read sebastian jungers the perfect storm but from what have heard it is an unforgettable tale nbased on true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak nusing wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the inyourface banality nright away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john reilly the comic relief who always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer nit is not the allstar casts fault just the characters designed for their portrayal nallen paynes character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because he never given any lines nare we supposed to root for guy whose face and voice we are never given chance to interact with nfichtners character is terribly underdeveloped we do nt know what he doing there where he from or who he supposed to be nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you nme nooooh real creative nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk nthe computergenerated images of gigantic waves crashing against helpless boat are thunderously real ni can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again nthis is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film nthe perfect storm was unfortunately disappointment nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so ni guess ill stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs
bingredients man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers nsynopsis what if you woke up one day and suspected you were not on earth and instead were part of an experiment in giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers nin dark city john murdoch rufus sewell has this problem ndark city starts out like noir amnesia detective mystery npoor john wakes up with amnesia in hotel room with dead dame in one corner na mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there and soon enough john is chased all over town by murderous army of pale people in black trenchcoats as well as by the police and the dogged inspector bumstead william hurt nis john murderer and what can his missing memories tell him nhe searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues nbut when the clues do nt fit it does nt just confuse him it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city nto john something is fishy and very unreal about this city nhow come its always dark and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning nand how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city or how to get to nearby shell beach nevery night around midnight john notices that the whole city enters state of suspended animation and at this time creepy alien experimenters known as the strangers come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into peoples heads with big hypodermic needles nthe strangers have the ability to tune or warp reality using telepathic powers nturns out the city is not on earth at all nand the reason why john does nt fall victim to the nightly suspended animation is because he is human mutation that possesses the same godlike realitywarping abilities as the strangers neven with the help of scientist dr daniel schreber can john take back the dark city nopinion director alex proyas he also directed the crow mentions this in the dark city press kit in films science fiction is always used to have big spaceships blow up cities ni think were little tired of that naccording to director proyas probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers nits designed so that you can watch the film over again and examine it from the perspective of main character other than murdoch nits philosophical piece ncinematic science fiction is basically thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens whether they be klingons giant bugs or proponents of the dark side of the force nbut science fiction in books reaches beyond the shootemup level and targets the big questions questions like who are we nwhat is the human condition nwhat is ethical nwhat would true human being do nfar from comic book style on the order of spawn batman or the mutant ninja turtles dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner ndark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay na little more than years ago the world was filled with unhappy peasants unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian military conformist medieval regimes nthe people took refuge in religion the idea being that earthly life was time of suffering but after death heaven would be available nmeanwhile the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven nwhen science finally overturned religion the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments nbut the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create world order as darkly totalitarian as the old nthis is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud kant kafka nietzsche and dostoevsky pondered what society should be and what place the individual had in it nthe existentialists in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be hostile indifferent or alienated universe nin dark city when the last dying defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens scientific experiments on the human beings brains failed murdoch replies pointing to his head because the human condition is nt located in here
bafter seeing blaze and driving miss daisy was ready for some mindless funoh maybe something like tango cash nmaybe not nmindless fun is one thing but braindead slop is another matter altogether ntango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in russell plays cash reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts nstallone plays tango wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he does nt need the money nin an effort to change his image stallone goes for yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names ntango cash is unbearably noisy nfor starters there harold faltermeyers annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes nto make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier nin fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases ntheres nothing like good old car chase to introduce the characters in movie nscreenwriter randy feldmans brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallones efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual nin movie with the iq level of an amoeba even great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligentand stallone is no lawrence olivier nits hard to imagine anyone reading feldmans script and thinking want to be in this movie nthe films plot does nt have one original bone in its body andagainyou have to point your finger at the screenwriting nfeldmans story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable nthey simply could have called it action movie nevery character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies nadding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as road runner cartoon naction movies do nt have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism nthe only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography nthere are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires nthe films main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell nunfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants nthe dialogue consists of nothing but oneliners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing nits shame because with workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into charming lethal weaponesque adventure ntango cash tries to maintain light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes nseeing russell in drag is the movies funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials nfurthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence nmachine guns and torture generally do nt mix well with comedy njack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing sleazy conniving villain nhis character however is runofthemill except for his strange obsession with mice nlike many movie villains palance likes to play games nin fact he sets ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room nyou have to wonder why palance does nt just shoot the detectives in the head nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent nteri hatcher plays stallones sister and russells loveinterest and she is just as pretty as can be nbut regrettably hatchers acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty nevery time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always fatal combination ntheres really very little if anything to recommend in the film nand more to the point tango definitely is nt worth penny of your cashso do nt bother
bon june selftaught idealistic yet pragmatic young man became at age the first head of government of newly independent african state formerly the belgian congo ntwo months later he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides nthis littleknown story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in lumumba npatrice lumumbas eriq ebouaney story has been told previously by helmer peck in his award winning documentary lumumba death of prophet virtually guaranteeing that his new fictional account of patriot remains true to its subject npeck with cowriter pascal bonitzer begins at the end of the story of the young political leader nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men nimages of hatchets saws and fastemptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image njump back few years to meeting among the black leaders in the belgianowned congo na third class postal worker lumumba speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes proclaiming himself not tribal not regional but national leader nhis small mobile party the congolese national movement mnc is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer and get his face known in the bustling capital stanleyville nat time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world lumumba is in the right place at the right time and through political savvy and chesslike manipulation achieves position of leadership of the mnc nas the date for independence approaches he tactically positions himself to be the new nations first prime minister and defense minister supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu maka kotto nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the countrys vast natural resources of copper diamonds gold and more nlumumba wo nt seek the help of the us knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves belgian troops violently intervene the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe pascal nzonzi and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from conference abroad nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimesodious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the and during the time the story takes place many new nations including nigeria and somalia were born with varying degrees of success and failure usually dependent upon which country colonized them nsome colonial masters were better than others nthe effort involved in lumumba is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades if at all nproduction values are first rate on what must be small by us standards budget nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique nthe screenplay covers lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life nthe political side of things is evenly told in linear straightforward manner that teaches not preaches nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man if bit as stalwart saint but does nt embellish on larger than life persona nthe family side of patrices life is handled in several perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child ni know the intent is to flesh the man out but too short shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba nthe story as such has lopsided feel about it nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character nthe actor gives convincing charismatic performance as the multifaceted politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions nin true docudrama tradition the supporting cast does not outshine the star complementing his good efforts instead lumumba is solid interesting educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos both nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything ve seen out of hollywood for months and give it

bone of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles nhe has built strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star nafter sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the usmexico border expectation ran high for his next film nunfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do nthen the film does exactly what it promised painful as that is nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized in central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas ndr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went nand he found out again and again and again nof course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into living hell na guerrilla war is always bad for civilians nbut the film talks down to the viewer ndr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country nhe has as great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world little better for the poor indios nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service nthen he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs squalid private pharmacy nin shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others nthe student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be good place to be nfuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and patient who happens to be an army general nthe results are little different than one would expect ndr fuentes starts out incredibly naive neven some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was nsayles certainly could have used minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos ndamian delgado makes late appearance as an army deserter nmandy patinkin has small role made to look bigger in the trailer
it was not scary nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over nwhen movie is called vampires not scary are nt words that should be associated with it nbut that was nt my only gripe njohn carpenter is name associated with cuttingedge cinema as in the intense scares of halloween the thing and the prince of darkness or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york nunfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach nwith an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects john carpenters vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan nthe film is at first concerned with group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people nlike some sort of holy ateam they even have their own soupedup van the bunch invade and wipe out nest of vampires in new mexico shack ntheir method is amusingly innovative the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks nto commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates motel room with hookers and parties the night away ntheir celebration is shortlived however as master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team nwoods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with woman named katrina sheryl lee nalthough the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith freaky marilyn mansontype who on mission that dates back years nalong the way they pick up priest named guiteau tim guinee character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl nupham in saving private ryan nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie but ca nt remember most of it because often found twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen nvampires finally starts to pick up about minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest nonly then does the film begin to even resemble carpenter flick nbut its too little too late nwe get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic come on were dealing with the master vampire here ninterestingly last summers vampire actioner blade was derived from comic book and vampires from novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former more deliberate superhero flick nwoods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that ohsocool stride nand his motive for killing vampires ntake wild guess hint killed his when he was just nat least blade had decent action and slick stylishness nvampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot nto make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies nit can be argued that maybe wanted too much from this movie nif not scary and gory wanted tense relentless and exhausting njohn carpenters vampires is none of these ni can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan nfor the rest of you looking for good scare beware vampires is film with no teeth
bcradle will rock is the latest effort from directoractor tim robbins nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in dead man walking he gets little overconfident and sloppy here nthe story is confusing and filled with many subplots so ill try my best and explain it as simply as possible nthe film is based on mostly true story about federal theater in the that produced play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down nits during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor nbetween this conflict lies what seems like subplots about those who work in theater or those associated nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience ntim robbins just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out nfor robbins it may be nice achievement but to me it seemed more like friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for few nlet me recap what each important character does so please bear with me its the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this nill begin with those involved with the play ntheres orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock noutside the play there the ventriloquist bill murray who wants relationship with federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving painter diego rivera ruben blades who unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack ntheres few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name few but those that mentioned were the most significant to the story nanyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown nsure the free speech segment was nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive nthe whole film is like this and its basically nothing but headache non the brighter side tim robbins direction was masterful nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas andersons latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that ca nt make movie that much better nalthough it has its moments not many of them but they re there cradle will rock stays true to its title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over
btectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out minutes into the movie nthe film which opened in canada during but was never released in the united states is based on stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while its evident that this could be fascinating live production the translation to the screen is creative disaster nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium ntectonic plates has storyline although the narrative is developed in decidedly nontraditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences nits not an inherently uninteresting way to present movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious allbutscreaming look nart nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters nbecause were constantly made aware that were watching play or movie its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas ntheyre not real sympathetic or believable nim willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not success ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage none day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself nwhile preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to rethink her decision nmeanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts crossdressing calls himself jennifer and becomes successful counterculture talkshow host nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include topless goddess and deafmute and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else nhowever as interesting as the film sounds and was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers nthe tone is soporific the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in pointless and irritating manner although it does nt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point nthere are some worthwhile moments such as silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who are nt bilingual nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because its different its not like anything they ve seen before and its pretentious nfor everyone else its not only waste of time but poor introduction to the work of robert lapage
bthe only thing worse than watching bad movie is realizing that the film had lot of potential and could ve been effective nsuch is the case with urban legend the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house nthe killer wears one of those bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up so you ca nt see the face ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days nanyhow the premise is certainly nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric nits very good setup that promises more chills to come nunfortunately the film never takes off from there nthe movie takes place on peaceful new england college campus nlike most slasher flicks this one also centers around young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac nive always wondered why these killers do nt save themselves lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill nafter the fine first scene the movie degenerates into monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music ni guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast nthe slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew nfalse scares should always be used in moderation nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just are nt as scary as they used to be nthis movie commits the biggest sin horror film can commitits not frightening nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in scream and scream nthis movie still adheres to them ntons of illogical moments about more than really have the inclination to list nand do nt mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense nthat type of illogical can be fun nthis film insults your intelligence more times than care to remember nthe last minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming nactually you wo nt be screaming at all nat its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script could ve definitely used rewrite or two nthe film still manages to have some strong points nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans nthere are some intentionally funny moments these were exceeded by the unintentional ones nthe film is well made from technical standpoint nbesides the first part there is also another good scene prolonged cat and mouse chase inside radio station nif there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music urban legend might ve been worth your money
btherere so many things to criticize about do nt know where to start nrecommendation turn off your brain do nt be like me decreasing the rating everyday because think about it too much na comet is about to strike earth causing catastrophe similar to the extinction level event that wiped out the dinosaurs nwhat follows is the story of presidents bid to think for the good of his people rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world nfirstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid nto be honest was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which is nt saying much nmimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted perhaps just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed far superior thriller the assignment nit is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives nhowever the film simply fails on that note nthe effects are wornout the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials nshes still making good money though nt leonis unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast nbut the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored nrobert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freemans president is restricted to well righteous president which means he not interesting at all nleonis character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters nwarning spoilers included but lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway nplot holes plot holes plot holes nnow nis threatening to exterminate more than of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there nwheres the logic nleder could have at least made it plausible with nand then it turns out that only few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims nthe film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing ni also fail to see how two teenagers carrying baby would be the first to climb up the mountainhill even with motorbike for headstart nits unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that does nt really matter nbuilding caves was strategy mentioned in dr nstrangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years nnow that is more practical use for caves nwhat is the point of living in caves nthere is no unlike dr nstrangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure nhow do plants grow nif humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves there no reason why they ca nt do it in the open nthe president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves nobviously this means that the other countries were informed long time ago and you ca nt be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media nin an important mission like that of the messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that is nt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres nthis is not deep impact its frivolous cheap impact nbut even with all that some overacting and rating its still watchable just do nt think about it nokay
bno matter what you suspect this is nt your usual action thriller nthe usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer nits one of those movies that after everything is revealed rapidfire at the end you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on new light nplot twists agogo are what you get here gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me nkeyser soze is name you ll hear at least hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason nits not only the name of the mysterious and possibly even mythical crime boss in the movie it also sums up the movie keyser soze in latin means an intelligent crime mystery story from upandcoming director bryan singer nor maybe should nt have bought foreignlanguage dictionary from the same company that makes those cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets nat the movies opening group of known criminals are brought in for police lineup including mcmanus stephen baldwin keaton gabriel byrne fenster benicio del toro buckney kevin pollack and verbal kevin spacey winner of the best supporting actor academy awardsymbol times new roman for his performance in the movie nverbal is sonamed because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing nhe also earns his name as the movies narrator spouting memorable lines like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did nt exist although obviously he does exist what else could explain kris kross having comeback in while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri any actor with multiple zs in their name is okay in my book nwe see the story unfold as spacey retells it nthe five felons upon being released from the lineup get their revenge on the police by exposing corrupt taxi service whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars and stealing all the money and drugs in the car nits definite case of male bonding for the five criminals who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze who sends minion to them with an offer they ca nt refuse nnamely they have to destroy sozes main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating ship shooting bunch of people burning all the drugs and stealing million cash nspacey does terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent cripple character to life and baldwin byrne palminteri and the rest make for good supporting cast nthe usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense keeping the viewer guessing until the very end and then still leaving few details open for scrutiny and discussion ni suppose all that would be cleared up if really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv na different mystery guess which may turn into murder mystery if that video ever comes on again
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned ni was incredulous when first heard that mgm was planning sequel to their sciencefiction flick species nsquandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming financial success raking in over million domestic during the competitive summer season despite distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsleys splendid actor but marquee name he ai nt nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film doubted that they dare tempt fate and go for another round nso here comes species ii with new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid nthe film follows the exploits of young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can nin other words patrick is like lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of huge percentage of men his age but there catch he an astronaut who recently returned from seemingly successful mission to mars and who now infected with alien dna npatricks overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring nand when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge halfhuman halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in government lab patricks primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction nspecies ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around nhowever this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is cheesy bmovie is quickly answered nmr brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches nlike the first film and perhaps in homage to it there real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering bloodsoaked room something bad happened here nthis time laura gets to stand over fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful nand she not even empathic nand when psychotically horny patrick accosts supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in woefullypaced suspense sequence eve who telepathically linked to her alienhumanhybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists he going to rape her nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates sense of humour of its own ntheres an amusing tongueincheek bit of product placement which does nt really make much sense but appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx he in aisle ninforms eve nif the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to bloody effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion nmuch of the film fails to make whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief nthe implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eves brain nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual nmy favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that its being foisted upon the public nreturning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but there realistically only so much one can do with this script as basis nmykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on generic brashmouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patricks neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film nmr lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all nms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that she so empowered na lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now that what call empowerment

bthe tagline on random hearts reads in perfect world they never would have met nin perfect world never would have seen this movie nthe biggest flaw is that minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production ndutch is sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department nkay is congresswoman from new hampshire nalthough they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs ndutch and kay are soon widowed when plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair nthe rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film ndutch is trying to arrest fellow officer task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare nall the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter nkays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on pedestal nthese sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth and consequently suffers nrandom hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other nthere is plenty of opportunity dutch having partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both nother than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts nhowever it is also hard to compliment it nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be
blogical time travel movies are nearimpossibility nconsidering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing script that deals with this problem is an imposing task noccasionally we get film that does manage it nterry gilliams monkeys was one such film nbut more frequently we get films that do nt much deal with it at all nthere is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies nthe terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with strong package of its own nis frequency filled with plot holes nyes ndoes it matter nnot really nthe film opens in october of nfirefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson nthe doublepronged story flashes forward to where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as police detective na strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in and that john has found in the present day nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom nnow flooded with memories of full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women nfrank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past nthe premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as result of their actions nthis is nt explained you just have to go with it nwhen frank does nt die in fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities and are to each other nsometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time nnow the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations are nt really the point nwhen frequency gets cooking its riveting little thriller even if it is confusing nwhat matters to film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up goal to be reached and conflict to be resolved ni liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward nit actually uses the metsorioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to baseball fan like myself ni even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script lot of leeway and lets face it its darn cool way to end the film nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as result the movie avoids growing stagnant nthe other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the fatherson relationship nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily its rocksolid job from both actors nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with dead relative or with future descendant nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you pretty good idea of how to answer that question nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we do nt believe in the characters we do nt care about the outcome of the thriller plot nhere we do care because we like the lead actors ni also liked some of the supporting cast members nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably nandre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john nhe has lovely scene in diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused nperhaps the only thing did nt like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the cameras focus goes little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard nbut that only because the film had already earned poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics ni freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as guy movie since it focuses on the very maleoriented idea of fatherson relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable nwho would nt want to speak with longdead parent nor see how their children turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while mist up nand do nt call me sissy
man is not man without eight taels of gold nstarring sammo hung sylvia chang directed by mabel cheung written by cheung and alex law cinematography by bill wong neight taels of gold begins as fish out of water story and at some point becomes love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love nneither aspect of the movie is entirely successful but both are good enough nand along the way there is one perfect scene which is one more than you find in most films nslim played by portly sammo hung better known as star and director of hong kong action movies is chinese immigrant who drives yellow cab in new york nwhen the movie opens we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver nhe does not seem particularly out of place nin fact he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years spending most of his life savings in the process and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water as he realizes that you can never go home nhe brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters cheap sunglasses and lobsters which have to be large to prove they re american the tokens of his success nhe also wears gold chain and gold watch because without eight taels of gold man is not man my dictionary tells me that taels are unit of weight used in the far east and assume the phrase is chinese proverb nhe loses most of this stuffexcept the goldwhen his van crashes into river and he has to hitch ride so to speak on raft along the river which runs past his parents village nwhen he arrives unannounced he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father nall of this has the makings of routine comedy and the movie has its amusing moments as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during celebration of his homecoming and they all give him birds so by evenings end he is surrounded by turkeys ducks geese and other sundry fowl nbut eight taels is not comedyit is sad sweet story about the choices people make and how they are sometimes irreparable ndirector mabel cheung an autumns tale the soong sisters sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in country on the other side of the worldwhat it is like to no longer have place to call home nslim does not belong in china nor does he belong in america where he can barely speak the language nseeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over small village we come to know the world slim left behind and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time and wishes it felt more like home nthe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed being one was sympathetic non his way to his parents village slim hooks up with jenny sylvia chang whom he knew when she was girl nicknamed oddsandends which is what he continues to call her although she is now mature professional attractive woman to be married in the spring to an americanchinese man nslim and oddsandends fall for each other nthats predictable nthe manner in which their non romance is played out is not nthe emotions involved are adult and complex and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma nits typical for instance that the fianc in this sort of plot be colossal jerk because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover nbut here the fianc is decent ordinary guy and although slim would like to feel anger he can not nthe fianc has done nothing wrong the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions take your pick neight taels has its share of flaws the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak but it compensates with insight nwhen oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco she notes resignedly its all the same nwherever we go well be in chinatown and her straightforward statement expresses much nthere is insight too in the understanding of the consequences of slim and oddsandends decisions he to move to america she to marry chineseamerican nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience perhaps of sense that the grass is always greenerand it turns out that both choices were wrong nbut they can not undo them they must live with what they have done nsuch is life nthe movie is tender toward these people but it offers no false comforts neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene which is the culmination of the love story nslim and oddsandends sit in secluded spot and talk hesitantly with the muted poppop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them and it seems the conversation will lead to kiss nthe exchange that follows and what slim then does is poignant and perfect with clarity and understatement we see two peoples lives their heartbreaks and virtues summed up in single moment nyes the film is flawed but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies
bcontrary to the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics nits actually three movies in one political film boxing film and love story nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal nweve seen it all before and were just not blown away with it like we should be noh well nits still an excellent irish story the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel daylewis an exira member who gets out of belfast prison after years and finds out that his troubles are far from over nfirst off the ira is having small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its subleaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail nwhile this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyles shallow grave reopen an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics to work together ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready to start boxing real people again nand danny runs into his exlove maggie breaking the waves emily watson who has nt seen him since he went in nthey do nt easily start up their romance again because she the wife of prisoner whom she married during dannys tenure in prison and also has son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon nbut the two are slowly redrawn to eachother again and this begins to complicate things nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself nweve seen it many time before but its at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times ntheres big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty nthe boxing story is very minor to the story but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly and even with good sportsmanship nthere are only few boxing scenes but they re never like raging bull letsstripdownthesporttoitsbones brilliant ntheyre more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother which is slightly unerving at times nand did nt know daniel daylewis was in such good shape nbut the backbone of the story is the love one nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight nas the film goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have to make real human decisions and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters nthis is how you write love story take note hollywood nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced with each of the parts of the stories working handinhand with eachother ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next nit made sure that we did nt just care for one of them nim not saying they re all equally great because the love story really carries the film but at least they all work out respectively nthe acting is amazing with daylewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry nim not sure if they re oscarnominee bound but they re very good nin the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike who is just great scene stealer nthe direction and cowriting by jim sheridan with the other cowriting credit going to terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls by at quick pace and ends much too quickly nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy nthough the boxer is good film it never achieves the greatness that it should nsure its masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get but on its own it just could have been better nbut it still works out gives us great love story combined with political and boxing drama and features great acting neven if it could have been better this ll do

bwarren beatty diane keaton goldie hawn and gary shandling star as pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsoms version of the classic romantic screwball comedy in town country nthe drawing room farce of the dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action nback then impossibly wealthy scions of society with too much free time would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers only to have everything come out all right in the end see the philadelphia story for great farce town country has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work and sexual misconduct on several levels nbut there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is tcs downfall nthere is obviously great deal of hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera involved in town country but without likable or at least interesting story to carry through their efforts it is all for naught nand that what we get here naught nporter stoddard beatty is highpowered new york architect with very good life indeed nhis year marriage to ellie diane keaton appears on the surface to be perfect nbut there are cracks just below this pristine surface nhis wife is suspicious of his whereabouts his kids do nt need him and his best friends griffin garry shandling and mona goldie hawn are in the midst of divorce nporter tries to get control of his life before it is too late but like man fighting against quicksand his struggle just sinks him deeper nat the minute mark of town country asked myself what the point ni was nt entertained laughed three times over silly little pratfalls and spent most of the film marking time til the end nwarren beatty wanders around with his character in bewildered fog making problems for himself by thinking with part of his anatomy other than his head nkeatons ellie is an empty headed flake who ca nt see the obvious as porter screws around on her nand as you get to know them who would want friends like griffin and mona nthe supporting cast is given nothing to do and sometimes does harm to the film given the material they are forced to use nnastassja kinski plays cellist with whom porter has fling nthe actress who has eerily failed to age over the years is miscast as the airheaded musician and the character does nt belong anyway njenna elfman is sweet but smart ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures nandie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as wealthy heiress is there any other kind in this movie nwho comes on to porter nthe saving grace is pair of quirky perfs by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowells very strange parents nglib rationalization of infidelity like if he does nt speak english it does nt count are staple for the screenplay nthe morality of the film seems to be if you can get away with it go for it nthe cast of characters are mostly people you would nt want to know never mind befriend nthe actors do their best but are hamstrung by the weak material nhelmer chelsom who made the outstanding offbeat comedy funny bones is mired in the mess of script and never puts his imprint on town country nthe production values are high as one expects from big budget hollywood film nbut the opulent sets by caroline hanania lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and topnotch photography by william fraker can not save town country nthe film has had long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better for me anyway if hollywood just said no to this movie ni give it
the animal is marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling nits clunky and slow like watching an wheeler trying to accelerate up hill nthere are certainly better things you can do with your time nactually if you ve seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments nthe story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be real officer nbut he afflicted with loseritis ndogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his coworkers ignore him ntruthfully with his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor we probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun nthis is actually bad because you ca nt like character if you ca nt develop sympathy for him nwe never do and it may be just as well that he drives off cliff and plummets to the canyon floor nhowever marvin is found by an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses radical and experimental procedure to save him implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs nas result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed nhe can smell drugs hidden anywhere on body swim with the speed of dolphin and can run as fast as cheetah nimagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation nwith his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him nhowever the spirit of the film takes raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges ngoats beware nhe also chases cats urinates to mark his territory or growls at his enemies nwhat he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich nequally tenuous is its other running joke which involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he black its reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything nthis element does nt work the first time its mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence nyou do nt have to be as wise as an owl to realize that the animal is tame nif there any reason to see this film its to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut nremember her nshe was voted off in week of the week program survivor nhere she plays marvins sunny love interest nwhile her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like lapping dog yuck nwith her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be meg ryan in the making nits too bad that she in such mediocre offering
bwhenever government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says look who talking nwhat have you done to the indians nhowever even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes nhollywood is just another example with its revisionist westerns made in early nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding with the th anniversary of columbus discovery of america none of such examples is geronimo an american legend western directed by walter hill film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers nthe hero of the film is geronimo played by wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of th century nwhen the movie begins in geronimo and his apaches made peace with government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation nhowever broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless nwith not more or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign ngeneral crook gene hackman commander of army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his force is nt enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest ninstead he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall ntogether with young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo ngeronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors nso the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people nalthough such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo nto be honest walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time ninstead they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band nto make even worse hill has some real problems with pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimos life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting nwes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces lot of passion in his role ncontrary to him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall neven hills directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of neven his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic non the other hand photography by lloyd ahern ii with the use of red lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic nall in all compared with some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness this film is nt so bad but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better

bin my review of there something about mary said something to the effect of laughter is nt everything ni now need to make brief addendum to my postulate laughter is nt everything unless watching jim abrahams film nsee spoofs are easy with me ni love movies and love movies that make fun of movies that love nsometimes the only one in the theater laughing nsometimes laugh so hard that embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone elses laughter nsometimes laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film nabrahams latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me nits gotten some mediocre reviews but hey the guy who laughs at everything nthere may be lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness ni enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking nmost lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense nmafia nhas no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh nthe film begins on the perfect high note with mockery of the opening of casino nour hero jay mohr is seen walking from casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against backdrop of flowing fire nto describe the story of mafia nis absurd and pointless but will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with lot of casino references inserted throughout nalong the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing nmovies like this rely on just few things but the most important element is direction nabrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so hold most of the success of mafia nto his experience nhe takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops nthe actors are all energetic which helps lot with the tone of the film nmohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here nhe looks like he having so much fun that he containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool nhes probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material nlloyd bridges does decent imitation of brandos godfather while pamela gidley is deadon in fullblown mockery of sharon stone nthe hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that supposed to give examples of things and be specific nunfortunately was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia nthat ca nt remember lot of what made me laugh nbut that good sign mafia nis so funny that was nt even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory ni laughed so hard that it shut off my brain ni know that does nt sound particularly complimentary but when watching dumb comedy like this the first thing want to do is shut off my brain nfinally film that does this for me
bwhen considering david finchers latest film the game four words come to mind do nt believe the hype nthis michael douglas vehicle from the director of seven is nt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe nthe film draws us in with an intriguing concept aided no doubt by the riveting trailer where jaded millionaire douglas is presented with the opportunity to enter into living fantasy nthis is nt simply virtual reality nthis is real life with deadly twist non his th birthday nicholas van orton douglas is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn nconrad has special birthday present for his brother nhe hands nicholas gift certificate and tells him to contact company called consumer recreation services they make your life fun conrad tells him nnicholas humors his brother telling him hell call but its clear he has no time for any foolish fantasy roleplaying as he calls it nthen for reasons that are never really made clear nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they re all about nhe ends up spending whole day going through their screening process which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have nnevertheless when it seems nicholas has been rejected as crs client the weird things start happening nof course when we ve only covered about minutes of screen time what else should we expect ndouglas has built his modern career around playing powerful violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands none of those films basic instinct came from the creative minds of writer joe eszterhas and director paul verhoeven nthe premise of the game is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film total recall nin that case the premise was implanting someone elses memories as way to enhance ones own life through dream vacation nyet in both films the real goal is to create vicarious bond with the audience nwe live the adventure along with the protagonist reacting to each twist and turn nin theory the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what is nt nall we can do is hang on until the end of the ride when the truth is finally revealed nnow for those of you who forgot let me say this again do nt believe the hype the game is not thrilling roller coaster ride nas suspensethriller it does nt do much but spin in circles nby the third reel was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as endured the predictable plot nis it any wonder douglas wo nt be able to resist the charms of mysterious potentially lifethreatening blonde ever heard of glenn close nno well how about sharon stone nthought so nif anything in this film surprises you at all would guess you have nt seen that many films nthere is no suspense here ntrust me looked hard to find some ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations nfincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas nthere are those that might say the game is not intended to be viewed literally ni would submit that is exactly the way tried to view the film nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues nthere is moment early in the film where van orton realizing his game has begun smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who in on the whole thing nhe is charged by his paranoia nhe is looking at the world through new eyes nit is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film nfrom there on the director only wants to stay step ahead of us nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into plot device nat the outset were told each game is tailored to the individual nultimately this game is supposed to work like crucible trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire proving his soul nyet as douglas endures his personal gauntlet were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is ni wanted to like this film more than did ni look at it as just anothergreat idea poorly realized ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film did nt mean we were seeing what was really happening nbryan singers the usual suspects for one film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas nalso there is the underrated jacobs ladder with tim robbins film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism nhere are two examples of films that do nt simply manipulate for manipulations sake nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to meaningful place none major issue that comes up in the game is whether or not the whole illusion is just highly sophisticated con game nwell can tell you right now after you ve spent your dollars you may be asking yourself the same thing

bkeep cool chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival non the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get good seat in the theater nthey need not have wasted their time nthe movie is billed as comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click ni wondered if there were jokes that was nt getting because not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor could nt be attributed to the cultural barrier either nkeep cool just is nt very funny nthe prelude to the film was visit by keep cools producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii nalthough the print made it the assistants luggage was lost ntoo bad that story was nt in the movie because it got big laugh nqu ying the films female lead was also on hand to give few comments nhowever whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fastpaced incredibly long tirade nit was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film nyou see keep cool is filmed almost totally with camera handheld by man with bad case of the shakes nat least that the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving ncinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has headache is another nalthough some might consider it form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying nheadache as said nthe film is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying nthey used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship nthe first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back nof course the thing is she does nt want to be won back and has nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit nin the fight the young man grabs laptop computer belonging to bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against lamppost nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced nthere is funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses nthere is no sense to be made out of the young womans behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character nthe bookseller would be better off without her nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owners hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to brick wall half the time na friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate nalthough only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we do nt see her from the midpoint on na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half nbut of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour nthere are few things that keep cool does right nas mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good nalthough it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations nin one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner nthe nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table nwith every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out

bof circumcision psychic wounds and the family sitcom nthe opening segment is something of foretaste of this film ntheres guys voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like and on the screen we see images of variety of oldish men and women nas his imagination plays he and we picture these motley characters in mixandmatch shuffle of unlikely marriages businesswomen with bums matrons with paint salesmen the images coming on in faster and faster frenzy nits not just witty funny summing up of the film themes you might not guess it yet but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on nwhat starts out as step in fairly sensible direction gets taken on road trip put through detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom and the general idea of the film does nt at first seem so wildly distant from standardissue hollywood comedy man who was adopted as child ben still er sets out on journey to meet his real parents along with his wife patricia arquette his baby and pretty psychologyresearcher tea leoni in tow nvarious mixups shenanigans oddball characters and yup disasters follow nbut if you think you ve been here before the dialogue and the direction by david russell who made spanking the monkey take it into another dimension nthe dreaded tname seems an inevitable reference point what with drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance but really the point is that the footmassage master has nt got monopoly on plot twists and fast funny irreverent lines or on the absurdities of ordinary speech nwhether its about circumcision psychic wounds oral sex carjacking the beauties of the armpit area or ronald reagan the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention nthe best thing is how these words are nt just there for the punchlines but are great precisely because they re said in character like tea leonis neuroticallycharged psychobabbler who able to say under assault its understandable if you find this threatening nthe cast is excellent throughout and rather than singling out anybody kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission nthere are some elements of woody allen film in this not to mention the handheld camera and loose improvisational feel of some scenes nlike allen russells interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children and everybody really nstill if you re expecting privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring la murphy brown frasier fillintheblankamericancomedy well it wo nt happen nthe film sets up expectations like these with the lead characters search or his origins and his hopes of selfhealing only to knock them down nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey oneness flirting with disasters charact ers embark on journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go nand that the film suggests is the essential family state and you better learn to love it nsomehow this is perversely feelgood cinema right up to its manic end
bthe bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see nwading through this gooey detestable sludge is quite the chore for even dedicated romantic nthose hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris odonnell vehicle should wander elsewhere the bachelor is painfully clumsy mess strung together with few brief moments of surprising poignancy nawaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money nalthough he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical prettyboy cocoon chris odonnell has an effortless charm as an actor nmost will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile ncan odonnell carry the weight of film on his shoulders nperhaps if he found the proper vehicle nbut the bachelor falls far short of the requirements nthe actor just ca nt register with such pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success na few instances of adorable humor aside it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is the bachelor nodonnell plays jimmie hopeless romantic in his late twenties who progressing in serious relationship with anne renee zellweger njimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage nthe problem is that his proposal sucks nbig time nyou can tell things are nt going pleasantly because jimmie gets the infamous deerintheheadlights look when anne questions his approach nand then the plot along with the stupidity of the movie thickens njimmies grandfather peter ustinov dies suddenly leaving video will behind for his grandson who also happens to be his only living relative neverybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of million dollars to jimmie nof course there catch he must get married before his th birthday stay joined with his bride for an entire decade and produce healthy children within the first five years nthe bad news is that jimmies birthday is the following day nwith anne out of town he must find willing bride to share his riches with nand within very limited time frame nthere are certainly few worthwhile aspects of the bachelor nfor one the movies approach is interesting and not dripping with clich nanother is the colorful cast nodonnell and zellweger are cute together and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in its own mediocrity nustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure and james cromwell is sincere and effective as wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures nand now the cons the approach may be interesting but in trying an oldfashioned method director gary sinyor gives the film synthetic feel nthe characters are drawn with obvious broad strokes and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable nyes the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute nthe screenplay is lamely written and the subject matter poorly conceived nthe considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted along with whatever promise the film initially contained npotential goes out the window early to suit sinyors colorful approach but not minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directors wishes nthe bachelor becomes lost without homing beacon to save it nyouve seen the tv spots have nt you nodonnell is madly rushing down deserted street and the caption reads what is this man running from nin actuality he fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune its one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film nafter seeing the movie believe that the approaching horde could be something else nodonnell could be running from his angry fans who have just endured the bachelor and are hunting him down for revenge
bthe first thing you notice about this movie is that its cold nplaced in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snowcovered ground against background of white njust what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night nas with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible na car salesman hires couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father nalong the way everything that can possibly go wrong does nin brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy nthere is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen nremarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs neven more remarkably it works nthe only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity nwith every good film the audience gains new knowledge nhere you learn two things neveryone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy nand do nt do violent illegal business with lowlife amoral degenerate scumsucking losers noh yeah if you get shot in the face using brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy
bone of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris odonnell stars in this remake of buster keatons silent film seven chances nnow ve never seen seven chances as more of chaplin fan than keaton fan but seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this nodonnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of pool table manufacturing company nhe also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years he unwilling to marry her nhis reasons nwell he guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently do nt like to be roped or something hey that the movies explanation nid marry renee zellweger in second neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose and when he does its the most absurd proposal ever uttered by man ever nhe essentially says to her you win and hands her ring nthe audience should now hate this character ni did nthen the meat of the plot presents itself njimmies grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business nhowever in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday which is just over hours away nhaving blown his chances with anne jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest business proposition nthe movie was nt half bad by this time surprisingly nit was nt boring me and even managed to read my thoughts at one point nustinovs character left video will and while he reading the ridiculous clause in it thought to myself what is this brewsters millions nas soon as thought it hal holbrooks character actually says what is this brewsters millions nit was quite surreal nsomething happens though during the films final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive nup to that point all of jimmies prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition which felt was good nat least the film was nt painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers nwhen jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played by artie lange making career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes front page story nat this point women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride nthese women arrive at jimmies location and immediately start bullying him about what he looking for in woman nwhen he had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that there been mistake and he wo nt be marrying any of them nas result the women proceed to chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off nthis goes on for the rest of the film nits just chris odonnell running from obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles nthe film finally ended thankfully but to this day still groaning nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of cast and crew info and special dvdrom features nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc which contains scenes not in the film napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing odonnell around the city and at one point odonnell is leaping from the tops of buses nso that was bad enough to be cut but the other minutes of bride shenanigans was good nugh
bthe summer movie season is still in its infancy nbut after diasappointing films such as godzilla and fear and loathing in las vegas it would be nice to see really good film nbut doubt you could have expected this nthe truman show is one of the most unique films have ever seen and it deserves spot on the decades best list nthere is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim yes that what makes this film great nthe blend of peter weirs masterful and in many ways brilliant direction peter bizious stunning photography and jim carreys performance is what makes this film work so fantastically nthere is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show nit may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect ncarrey has made very wise choice nby playing mildmannered truman burbank he allows himself enough room to be comical and therefore not alienating his true fans while still showing vulnerable and human side nthat is side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes ntruman burbank was born to an audience of millions nhe was chosen before birth to be the focus of hour television show neverything in his environment is controlled by team of technicians led by the shows director christof played by ed harris neveryone in trumans life is an actor or an extra nthey are all being watched by millions of people around the globe people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in trumans life nbut he is the only person that is not aware of it nthe classification of the truman show may be tricky nthe audience reacted to many of trumans revelations with laughter ni did not laugh much during the film because was so emotionally wrapped up with the character nthe things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes because what was happening to him indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong nso is this going to end up labeled as comedy na drama nit really depends on the audience nbut to me the truman show was touching sad tale about the extents to which corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others nbut above all else the truman show was stunningly beautiful picture with humor heart and scary realism noscar predictions in june are pointless but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of as originally planned james cameron would be oscarless

bthose of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that have not read victor hugos novel les miserables ni do nt know if lot of people have though imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel ni have nt even seen that ngoing into this film had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters even expected the film to be musical nwalking away from it kind of glad had no prior experience with the material nwriterdirector bille augusts film version is straightforward beautifully told film nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from year prison sentence nhe is allowed to stay in convent by kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior nthe priests words of wisdom influence him and he makes vow to change himself nnine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago nconflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be convict njavert is hellbent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice nalong the way valjean meets and falls in love with peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire danes nles miserables is visually solid and often striking picture nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets do nt look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular nbasil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced though it does get bit heavy at times nmany scenes in the film have memorable photographic quality such as the climax which takes place next to dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening naugusts keeps the story simple which hear is good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately ni was also impressed that he did nt go overboard with flash and style which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo juliet nthis film feels solid and whole and each scene has certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested nliam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly man who clearly fits that adjective nthurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has lot of range and can perform in very nonglamorous role such as this one nrush is absolutely incredible as javert do nt remember ever feeling so strongly about villain as do here he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense ni ca nt be as charitable for danes however though know she is talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character bit nles miserables is as ve said solid intelligent motion picture nmy only complaint is that it feels bit too easy and perhaps too staged neach scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but did nt always want them to be nfor the most part les miserables is not subtle or deep picture nits good movie and tells its story well but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle nhowever in film this exciting and wellproduced few minor flaws are easily overlooked
something is fishy in the state of universal nabout ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies nweve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on nto date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or mining claim nmost of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane my personal favorite is patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on small budget nnow we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter well she not widow and the kid is nt her daughter but you get the idea nthe lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who is nt given chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script nthe child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that child actor need not be bad thing to have in movie she outshines her material all the way through nin simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now nthe polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fastmoving boats airplanes and jet skis nenola found at sea as young girl has mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola nthe psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland nplayed with typical selflampooning rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie that close to amusing nhis performance is almost laughable but there just is nt enough there to be funny nthe star and coproducer is kevin costner nhes playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea man called the mariner who turns out to be gilled waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet nvery little is done with this nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earths surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after its more than few decades old and so on and so on nim quite fond of tina majorinos previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorns past accomplishments and still speechless over costners dances with wolves nbut this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it nthis movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars and there nothing in it we have nt seen before done better on only few percent of the cost of this turkey nat minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make nthe budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx nin sum this movie is beneath contempt nit has nothing new to offer it has script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of small nation nif you have to go see it see it on fourdollar matinee notherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass reflective surface for weeks
desperate measures is generic title for film that beyond generic nits also depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune nthe movie is big disappointment and yet its somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing ntoo bad the executions all wrong though because the setup of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use nsan francisco cop frank connor garcia is single parent with troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only bone marrow transplant can push into remission neven worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery he at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital nwhen he does make run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy none misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness nwhats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just little too hard to swallow ntake for example scene where mccabe is trying to make getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son nwhatever nto be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems nfirst and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of its opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour nonce mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab hostage and get away nalso the movie is so intent on giving you hootinducing lipsmacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movies headscratcher of sendoff confirms this nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department ncast against type michael keatons understated menace is highly effective nalthough he not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off taut emotional chord njoseph cross as garicias ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as doctor who becomes major player in the unfolding chaos nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost nit goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own
bmy inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air nsure seen them all at least once but could always count on at least few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv neven though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb antifans still have the propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness think of the nas what would happen if sgt njoe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic nin this election year more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters nhe gives each one different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up nthe produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying nthis is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason was wondering if there would even be plot ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and half of trademark webb rants but the ngives us more much more nwebbs mission is to make man out of private owens the local screwup nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered nthis of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life living hell nfor those of you who have nt been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching heres reprint of typical monologue of his ni ca nt duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what talking about now you listen to me youngster nsomeday you ll wake up fighting on beach and you ll pray to god somebody does nt get killed because of your foolishness nive got headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours you re gon na turn around and ill be standing right there ni could nt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from hard days work by going to the local bar where he orders tomato juice nhe meets woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival another marine nwebb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of dame do you think you are nbogart he ai nt nthe other ngets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl he damn good ni guess just little jealous njoin the club were all jealous of jack webbs way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in later scene as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me to talk to you nin here he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras nthe woman goes off to help customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen na little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here you re man are nt you nhe does nt reply but you know he thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small nmust be one of those children everyones been talking about nthis poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions he responsible for nthe movie does nt focus too closely on webbs romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for flea owens killed during one of their drills nafter two privates hatch scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed male or female nowens replies male sir nwebb yells to the platoon this ai nt the one nthat such scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines nsomeone wanting to parody this movie could nt do more comical job than webb did nit makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself ntheres scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter nwebb bursts in the room and shouts what did tell you about laughing nto which the private replies sir only nineyearold girls laugh sir nand let me tell you was as happy as nineyear old girl while watching this movie

bcan horror movie truly be called horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements ni think not but that what children of the corn issacs return wants us to believe nthe sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date nunlike the other five chapters children of the corn is confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary nthe film follows hannah natalie ramsey teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her st birthday nwhat starts out as daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder nthats about all that understandable in the film as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy nand this is supposed to make sense nreally nfrom the start the film is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film nthe film runs at short minutes but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn issacs return excruciatingly boring nplot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklins unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion neveryone and everything involved with children of the corn issacs return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along with director kari skogland should crawl under rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash nthe bottom line horrible horrible horrible nanother attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat nand what with that title nthe devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film nlets pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series none of the worst horror films in years
bits fact that good thriller or action movie does nt need violence to be good or worth watching nall it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails nand what kind of violence could be more efficient than global thermonuclear war nand potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon na computer whizkid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades nbut after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants to be the first to play it ninstead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad nwith the help of jennifer girl in his biology class he starts to play nice game of nuclear war with wopr war operation plan response topnotch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer ni remember being and watching this at the cinema nit was very efficent at giving you scare in those days and that has nt changed nof course nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in ni would nt be surprised if this gave people nightmares ni hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon nbroderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains mystery nbut the rest of the actors are by no fault of their own restricted by the script to play onedimensional grownups ndavids parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the movies like secret admirer porkys or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove nif for no other reason you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days ndavid uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers nthe modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on nfar from any modem my guess is that its some kind of bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum nthe big computer at norad has lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sfmovie but its hardly impressing compared with what you can get today nwhat are the lessons we can learn from wargames nmake sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers thank you whoever it was for giving us graphical user interface when we use our computers
bwhen you ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies guess you try video games nwhy did go to see mortal kombat annihilation nthe quest to seek an answer to this query may prove better movie that the one just saw nthis film was bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack nthe plot is fairly simple portal has opened between our world and the outworld allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn brian thompson to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity nthe good guys led by sorcerer rayden james remar and human mortal liu kang robin shou must take the fight to outworld where the fate of both worlds will be determined nheres the catch they must reunite princess katana talia soto who on the good side with her resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander who on the bad side for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanitys safety for another generation nhow this is supposed to work still have no idea but liked katanas line knew love would keep us together since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and got good laugh nthere are some seriously stupid things in this movie ntake for example transportation system which utilizes the inner winds generated by earths magma flows nyou get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast nhow fast nas katana says you will be moving so fast it will be as if you are not moving at all nwhat nlater sonya blade sandra hess goes to find jax lynn red williams otherwise known as saber on tvs american gladiators at medical research facility on the island of oahu nhow do we know this is where she went ntheres sign on the facilitys perimeter fence that reads medical research facility oahu hawaii nremember this is not caption but an actual sign ni guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are ntheres lot of major flipping action too nthe first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another ndo they land and immediately get into the fighting ndoes one of them land first and catch the other off guard ndo they collide in midair nno apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away nwhy did they need those metal balls to travel neveryone could have just flipped from point to point ni have to admit the fight scenes are pretty good although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics nthe movies thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly ouch was the most common expletive heard when screened this one nyou could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights not plot would be the main draw since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next nit seems that all there is in this movie nmaybe it is nas had mentioned the acting is bad ntheres not one solid performance in the film although williams as jax was pretty funny nafter fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling jax says you look good in mud nno really you do nremar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang nbrian thompson who has played good guys bad guys and even an alien on tvs the xfiles but always some musclebound behemoth is your average evil demigod but its more the scripts fault than his own that he does nt have anything original to say nthe one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and half nanother thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking blood only appears in one scene nall in all mortal kombat annihilation is loud violent shallow and marketed toward kids nhey just like the video game

dangerous escape for italy ncan they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred nthey show the destroyed lives families that have been split up and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson his producer and flynn have befriended nthe group of twentysomethings reside in bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living

bwho would have thought njim carrey does drama nwhen first saw the advertisement for the truman show thought what hilarious idea for movie nhowever it was an even better premise for drama nthe truman show takes us into world that revolves around one man nthat man is truman burbank jim carrey ntruman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly cristof wants to keep it that way nchristof is the god of this madeup world nhe keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles nthere were few attempts to tell truman about his world but they failed and life went on as normal nthe opening parts of the film introduce to trumans world nwe see what he is doing at his current age then we get flashback at his past nit may seem tad boring but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start nthe film can be described in one word weird nit seems like such simple idea yet it is something that majority of us would never think of but andrew niccol did nit seems like warped idea but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it njim carrey actually lived up to the hype nthe hype whether good or bad always focused on carreys ability to do drama nno one doubted how extraordinary this film could be the only thing they doubted was carrey nand he showed them all up njim carrey was snubbed at the oscars ni do not think he was the best actor but he deserved the nomination nhe plays truman burbank the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world nhe has lived normal life for almost thirty years but then strange things start happening nhe ventures into the wrong elevator na light crashes in front of him nhis father comes back and is then pulled away nwe are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is show but truman does not nand it is just constant progression that never gets sluggish ncarrey is able to shed his comedy to play major role in major drama nlaura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife nshe plays her role as advertiser and budding star to point npeter weir does not make the cast perfect and their flaws eventually lead to trumans escape nthe story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down ndespite carreys greatness the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris who plays the god of trumans world nhe displays the pressure he is under the world he has created nhe becomes so paranoid that he believes he is god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of life nthe action moves at good pace and rarely gets sluggish nbut the main point of the film is how it looks like television show nit really makes you think nmaybe your brother is an actor maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show nsome of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking nor when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival nand when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon noah emmerich delivers his dramatic line nall of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative ni was not only enjoying the film was overwhelmed by genius of it noverall the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood njim carrey shows that he is not just man of million faces but legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best nandrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection nthe truman show is must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film
bonly year after the initial release of scream the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters nwhile the tongueincheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film its really sideshow to broader commentary on violence and the media and more conventional horror story nthe first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant nthe premise of scream is that series of copycat killings begin when movie called stab based on book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening ni had heard about this scene before went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy nits conclusion in which bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think its publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else nthe satire in scream thus takes on broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general nalthough resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well neverything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there are nt any wes carpenter jokes this time nmore importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroines life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show nunderstandably scream does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense and what we have is pretty darned good horror movie in its own right nwe do nt just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of crazed murderer lurking around the corner nwhile have not seen any of his other work its easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing nunfortunately scream occasionally reverts to the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window nfor example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion nthere are also few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in situation such that he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction nas for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor nwell its hard to say ni gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as lighthearted sendup scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment nim not sure which is the better movie but did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck
bthere are times when the success of particular film depends entirely on one actors effort noften single performance can turn what might have been rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile nwhen one of these comes along usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewisons the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to film belonging to director nbut though he does decent work jewison can not claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington nwashington plays carter boxer who in was convicted of latenight shooting in bar njailed for years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after second trial and countless appeals nthe situation changed when group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter nthrough the efforts of that group and carters lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted nthe film details carters childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of racist cop dan hedaya nwhen he finally got out of prison for good carter became rising star as middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned nflash forward to when lesra vicellous reon shannon young africanamerican boy living with group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison nthe book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes to the injustice that was carters life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer nlesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal the hurricane leans on denzel washington nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly nits probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely for the film nthe actors work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arms length nwe feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost nwashingtons is performance of weight and emotional depth nhe does nt merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level nhis work is masterful and for half of this film realized that the scene was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor nnorman jewison directs the film doing reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing nhis boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage njewison puts together particularly nice scene by utilizing pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for days when he refuses to wear prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell njewisons best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again nsadly though the films chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts to round the pike this winter nthere is much to interest viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets chance to take the most clich route possible it does ntake look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil ncarter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is stereotype nthe canadians are good nthe cops are bad nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their loveydovey commune and it is commune despite the films failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison nloves gon na bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from madefortv lifetime special nits too bad nthe cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often ni wanted real reason for the cop to hold grudge against carter other than he racist pig ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice nin short wanted to see the film through less distorted lens ncriticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved nfor example the film gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner nmost accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly nfurthermore much of carters criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained nof course the hurricane works mainly as fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues do nt remove one fact the hurricane is highly flawed film nonly one actor could have made schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and its good thing the hurricane has that actor ncarter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but he not the only one nwashington makes this film look good ndenzel washingtons the hurricane nsounds pretty good to me
bwhat great film nwhat stunning touching heartwrenching heartwarming lifeaffirming miraculous film nfrom its opening moments life is beautiful walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy na car with no brakes speeds through the town and guido roberto benigni motions people to move out of the way nthey mistake him to be the fascist president traveling to their town that day nheil nheil nhuh nshortly thereafter the president drives through and people stare with blank faces nthis is standard but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff the clown who is also jew triumphs over the antisemitic society in which he lives ngranted the great dictator comes to mindcharlie chaplins almost masterpiece ni think lib which benigni wrote and directed trumps gd in one essential point chaplins jewish barber gives great speech at the climax but to do so he had to break completely from character nbenigni is given similar situation he is mistaken as fascist dignitary and must explain to classroom filled with schoolchildren on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race nbenignis guido stays in character and delivers the speech keeping the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept nit is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema nthere are many other scenes especially in the first half which are bright and loopy and funny and silly nslapstick reigns and although the film is subtitled there was no doubt that universal language was being conveyed nand although its focus is on the courtship of guido to dora played by nicoletta braschi benignis real life wife silent undercurrent creeps in nthis is clearly racist society evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others and it will soon affect him and his family nthe second half of the film takes place five years later in an unnamed concentration camp where guido dora by her insistence and their fiveyear old son giosue giorgio cantarini are deported nguido seeing the horrors is desperate to protect his wife and child nfor his wife who is separated from him he must find ways to communicate to her that he is all right nfor his son and this is the most controversial part of the film he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game its rules include hiding being very quiet and learning to not ask for seconds nwhich raises the big questions how do we deal with pain nwith persecution nwith injustice on the worst level nits said that tragedies bring out the best in people finding strengths they did not realize they had nother times they deteriorate become overwhelmed with little strength or incentive to swim nsometimes even people giggle in these moments as if there were vacant emotion behind them yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds nbenignis guido realizes this nhe is the clown but he is not fool nhe sees the slurs and the vandalism and while feeling the weight of the verbal attacks he still has the audacity to see if everyone around him perhaps even the antagonists laugh nhis liberty is stripped but not his dignity and certainly not the dignities of those around him nits obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation but does so with grinning joyful demeanor nperhaps that is form of denial nperhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster not unlike the very different brazil nor nperhaps this is an example of great fortitude with no weapons but wit nwhatever his purposes is subject to debate but also sure sign that this is one of the great threedimensional characters stranded amidst terrifyingly risky concept nsurprisingly it works nit is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust nits not that the atrocities are trivialized far from it nthey do nt have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horrorless is more ni believe that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone and like the theory that it is guidos alternate reality that were seeing nhowever any criticism that this is rewriting history that the holocaust was nt as bad as it seems is simply offtarget nbenignis film has won audience awards at cannes at toronto and is definite shooin for best foreign language film hopefully for best picture as well nhe has been made an honorary jew by jerusalem film society nit swept the italian academy awards ncontroversy notwithstanding it is one of the great films this year and as of this writing the one to beat for best film nmasterful nmiraculous na mustsee
bnote some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers nbe forewarned nits startling to consider that it was only few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut wide berth nthe lion king had just cracked million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history continuing to build on sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast nsince then though disneys animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns with pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and this years hercules successively proving less and less potent nwith the once seeminglyimpregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from foxs anastasia disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation the little mermaid nwhile the animation for the film is as is typically the case for disney films unquestionably topnotch the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music nthe films storyline is fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man except in this case the chaperone is crab the teen is young mermaid and the object of her desire is human prince nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric she resolutely smitten and she such pure and endearing character that one ca nt help but invest their heart with her nthis simple but touching love story coupled with healthy dose of smart humour makes the little mermaid remarkably captivating picture none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it the voices cast for its motley crew of characters nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue which started to certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams muchheralded turn in aladdin by the release of the lion king and henceforth the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities nwhile its understandable that animated features lacking the namerecognition or drawing power of disney say baltos use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda or even anastasias showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products its unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy ndo we really need to hear say demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame nis the films entertainment value really augmented by hearing recognizable voice rather than voice which best suits the role not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan nfortunately the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid although perhaps more obscure are impeccably cast nchief among them is jodi benson tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you who voices the films heroine ariel to perfection with wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor and gorgeous singing voice ms benson provides most engaging anchor for the film she the only reason even consider catching flubber nsimilarly samuel wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian the weary guardian crab nhe easily milks his lovable characters comic moments for all they re worth and his rendering of two of the little mermaids big tunes under the sea and kiss the girl have become the stuff of legend npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil seawitch ursula while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariels father king triton nin large roles and small edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef the little mermaid is impeccably cast nof course the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken music and howard ashman lyrics who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr ashmans untimely death nnot only are mr menkens tunes unbearably catchy but mr ashmans charming lyrics are fully integrated into the films storyline so that the songs are virtual extension of the characters dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film nmr menkens score for the film is equally topnotch the sequence where eric voiced by christopher daniel barnes and ariel tour his kingdom in horsedrawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr menkens fine score nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypsostyled under the sea as joyfully crooned by mr wright which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song indeed one of the many little joys in screening the film during its rerelease was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune but my favourite is ms bensons heartfelt rendition of the ballad part of your world an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope wonderfully lyricized by mr ashman which accompanied by the films most dazzlingly polished animation sequence packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes nduring the songs reprise which builds to crescendo with ariel arching on rock as wave crashes in the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history nas of this writing november has come to an end as has disneys limited day rerelease of the little mermaid ntheres no question that the primary motivation for if not the films reissue itself at least its timing was to reinforce disneys dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to foxs costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture anastasia nin every respect the rerelease of the little mermaid appears to be success the films grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic million mark the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video pulling in close to million in its opening weekend and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressivelymarketed anastasia in headtohead competition it siphoned enough from the fox films opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot allowing for disneys odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away nbut although disneys motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were selfserving and protectionist the real winner is the public nany reason to put this film back into theatres is good one and its true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disneys modern animation renaissance and one of the greatest animated films ever made
minutes not rated though suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language nmamoru oshii is name that probably is nt very wellknown to most american audiences but perhaps it should be noshii was the director of last years bestknown japanese animated film import ghost in the shell and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films with deep philosophical bent none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series nin its many incarnationsgraphic novels manga two different runs of madeforvideo episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and television series running to nearly fifty episodespatlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan nset in the very near future though it was somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus nas whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century nwith the rise of labors however has come new menacelabor crime nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors to fight labor crime nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv who through no fault of their own have acquired bad reputation for destructiveness nsometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers nthe story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization nhowever the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead nshinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out with new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by nthis hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over of the nations labors including the patrol labors of sv nsince that installation dozens of labors including heavilyarmed military model have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos some wags have compared this to windows nits up to asuma shinohara labor command officer with sv and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries to find the source of these problems before more laborsincluding svs ownfall victim to them and before hos drags his fathers company down with it nas was the case with ghost in the shell if you just want nobrainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you npatlabor the movie is more of psychological thriller technological suspense drama nit is closer perhaps to chrichton novel than to an action movie crichton novels that have been made into action movies notwithstanding nthere are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar to sequences from ghost in the shell nthis movie is fraught with symbolismin fact large part of it is based on christian symbolism npatlabors nearfuture setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar to our own present day nthe film uses this setting to make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new nthis is question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabors alternate setting nas far as the technical aspects of the film go referring to the subtitled version as that the only one ve seen the film transfer is clear almost phenomenally so nthe animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful bettersuited to humor the movie however makes everyone look great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going to be for the most part deadly serious storyline nas far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in patlabor the movie ni do nt think can recall ever seeing fisheye perspective used in any other animated film save for ghost in the shell another oshii film or indeed in many other movies at all nthe cinematography is wellsuited to the storyline emphasizing what it needs to though couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange to western audiences nthe audio track of patlabor the movie is in glorious hifi stereo and should be used to demonstrate home theater systemsit is that good neven without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to come from that side ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming nthe sometimesunderstated sometimesblaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery nas far as the subtitles go have to say that they re among the most easilyreadable subtitles ve ever seen for anything nlarge enough that they do nt strain the eyes but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen nalthough it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion patlabor is foremost not an action movie nalthough it is superblyrealized film it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story and that could detract from some peoples enjoyment nmy
bit is movies like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch nbased on the late television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover nhowever things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion nof course the ads make it seem like so much more nquick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like nsounds like cool movie does it not nafter the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not nthe mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply is nt enough nthe film is best described as cross between an hourlong cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half nand with it comes every single clich nit does nt really matter that the film is based on television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching nunfortunately even he not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters do nt do much apart from occupying screen time nwith the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset ndespite an american rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset ninformation on the characters is literally spoonfed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable nthe way the film progresses you likely wo nt even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because you ll know they are nt nbasing the show on television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one that missing finger or two nthe number of times that checked my watch six is clear indication that this film is not one of them nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teenflicks that we ve been seeing as of late navoid this film at all costs

bthe realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge nsuch popular and

more thought that the escapism they achieved nit really was nt until producer george pal took charge of robert heinleins novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that scifi as it

sort of real chemistry ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation nand the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better nhes just having too much fun here to give damn nthe script has few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship nalso when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone nsubtlety is nonexistent here nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely nafter the opening introduction of the characters which lasts full minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface nthen there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity nthe film could lose about minutes and actually gain some momentum nthere are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to dead stop nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with level of realism that has nt been seen since space odyssey nthe visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth nthe only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of plastic model kit than something from another world ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film nthe opening sequence alone in seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost minutes an homage to hitchcocks rope as we are introduced to all of the characters nscenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution nbut the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang nsadly it is not ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting nbut its the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction na disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals
bthe one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film nsince june have nt been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out ahas take on me in his yellow miata nwhy would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine nhonestly was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually front for decently funny movie nman was wrong ncorky romano is one of those throwaway clich ridden tvstartofilm vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots nfortunately for chris kattans precariously positioned career corky does have some good laughs even if most of them are of the lowestbrow variety nkattan plays the title character the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has penchant for sunshiny tunes bright ties and banal coffee mug slogans you do nt have to be crazy to work here but it sure helps nwhen his mob boss dad peter falk is about to be put away on murder charges his bungling lughead brothers peter berg and chris penn rope in innocent black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence npredictably hijinks ensue nif the basic plot sounds bad wait until you get into the innerworkings of this clunker nthe writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity ncorkys fbi agent identity is named corky pissant that pronounced peesahn nits french nhe becomes firstrate agent by accidentally stumbling mr magoostyle onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations which plays like something out of sitcom nand not good sitcom mean nthe romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face nand in scene taken straight from there something about mary corky gives dachshund mouthtomouth resuscitation nbut its not complete disaster nthe manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments including bit featuring cat in fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren german shephard and kilo of cocaine nplus berg whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope gives great turn as the illiterate brother paulie nand its nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work nunfortunately for those out there who ca nt truly appreciate animal or fart jokes corky wo nt have much to offer you nso the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv asking who is corky nyou can simply reply who cares
bplot peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and does nt quite know what she wants out of life none day she falls upon something and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others nshe starts with the people around her but when she suddenly falls for her own guy she ca nt act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature ncritique clever quirky original french flick set in picturesque paris featuring an endearing lead with giant imagination much loneliness and little bit of love for everyone nthis is feelgood kind of movie fairy tale for grownups who are bummed out about life nit does nt pretend to be deep it does nt weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters its basically just cute movie in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year sham on so many different levels you might as well slap this film up for consideration also since its quite bit better and much more original than the former none thing that this film is nt though at least according to me is the best film of the year it was bestowed the honor of best in at least different film festivals so far this year nit actually managed to stagnate little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long its little over two hours but it felt even longer with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters all of whom were nt as interesting as the lead and lot of indecisiveness from ms amelie herself which got frustrating nthankfully this film does nt bog itself down with too much of that stuff and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kindhearted french girl non the whole its lot of fun and it carries beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man nthe lead audrey tautou is perfect for the role and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film nunfortunately the rest of the cast is nt as welldeveloped and even though most of them are pretty appealing couple could ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plotwise by the films end what happened to the guy in the caf who was spying on his exgirlfriend the whole movie nnow have nt seen too many recent french films will admit but if this is the kind of scene that they re developing over in le pays du vin would nt mind catching more of their flicks in the future crimson rivers was another french film that saw earlier this year which really liked ironically that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz who is the costar in this film ngranted the english subtitles got little tough to keep up with at times speak and understand french also but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head especially since the films visuals were so intriguing that you just could nt help but constantly gawk at them but the general idea the background music the nifty french neighborhoods the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the storyline from the start were all very easy to appreciate and for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world nin fact recommend it to anyone looking for jolly ol time at the movie house with particular emphasis on folks with lot of imagination little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts nand this guy directed alien resurrection nget outta here nnote especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loveshates of everyone with exact mentions in the film nit was very original very well shot and very nostalgic as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described ngood stuff nwheres joblo coming from nchocolat crimson rivers ghost world like water for chocolate brother where art thou pay it forward rushmore woman on top
bwhat is freedom nhow does one determine who is free nin those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now nyet the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations nthat is in essence what steven spielbergs gripping drama amistad is about nthrough its various dramas spielberg presents case about group of africans who after being seized from their home were forced onto ship and sent to the united states aboard la amistad non their way there the slaves led by cinque djimon hounsou rebelled killing off part of the crew nhowever the ship was still directed towards the united states where the africans were brought to trial under murder nin the court various factions claim ownership of the slaves and therefore try to seize them away nthe united states government led by president martin van buren nigel hawthorne and secretary of state secretary forsyth david paymer try to ship the africans to spain where an year old isabella ii anna paquin wants them back nthe two spaniards who own la amistad want the slaves for themselves nthe american ship that found the slaves also wants them nin the midst of this are two abolitionists stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman who want the slaves to be free nthey enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey who tries to free them nthrough various legal proceedings the case appears before the supreme court where it is argued by expresident john quincy adams anthony hopkins nthe film itself is visual wonder nspielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in dark somber mood when appropriate and visual setting when appropriate as well nat times the film is very slow and very methodical nhowever spielberg is not at his finest here because the courtroom scenes have tendency to lag nthe film is in essence courtroom drama one whose events are oversimplified nthe characterization is also weak displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin mcconaughey and especially morgan freemans abolitionist nbut spielbergs finest work in the film the opening scene scene of cinques family and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america is altogether stunning nit is this emotional force that carries the film nmcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans hopkins is sensational as the old adams freeman is outstanding when used spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents and the rest of the cast is stellar nthe movie however belongs to hounsou nhis emotional intensity is brilliant nspielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou and the films extraordinary power is simply captivating nthe film is flawed for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard nbut that does nt matter nthe story is gripping one and one of extreme importance nkudos to spielberg for finding it finding the right men for the job and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque na good job all around

mission to mars is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie all five minutes of it mission does give you payoff but when it does come its too little too late mission has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dimeadozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboardcutout roles nim sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm nglances do nt communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end nthe film spends an hour on this kind of stuff building to its climax na lot of it is cliched glorification of family relationships marriage friendship unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap nthere are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film and give it points for trying to stay true to the science know trying is the key word here nthe sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching but as mentioned by then were so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over ngreat design good intentions but no cigar nif you re not die hard scifi fx or jerry oconnell fan his character is the only one who has some semblance of character do nt waste your eight bucks on this nand what the hell tim robbins died halfway through the movie in stupid way too nthats just unforgiveable
flubber is the second best example of how to take all the life out of film remake an adaptation and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney nits the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids but anyone else will feel left out as its boring slow and incredibly lifeless nwhat could be film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water and its shame because it could have been great film nhypothetically mean flubber as you probably know is remake of the disney classic never saw the absent minded professor where well absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as flubber you know flying rubber nthe new one keeps the basic plot but appears to have added lot else like more absentmindedness on the part of the proffessor some more villains and several showstopping moments like big rumba with the flubber and some more elaborate setups none which really make it any better but instead make it worse nthe basic plot revolves around college professor philip brainerd robin williams who creates lots and lots of inventions but is sadly absent minded nin fact he forgotten his wedding to the colleges president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times before he forgets it again at the beginning ndoesnt this warrant some kind of mental treatment nanyway on his wedding day the third one he invents the flubber which not only bounces off of everything like super ball on speed but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in the abyss nphilip believes that this invention once fully realized will save his college which is in threat of being shut down by millionaire tycoonvillain chester hoenicker raymond barry which is ironically enough the same college his brat son will wheaton thought he was dead goes to nthrough plot twist hoenickers goons named smith and wesson ha ha what great sense of humor this film has who are played by clancy brown and ted levine both who needed the pay check discover it the hard way and try to steal for hoenicker who wants it just cause he evil enough na subplot involves philips attempts to win back sara who angry at him and with good reason but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing the hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole once again nand in another subplot philips daytimer robot weebo voiced by the oneandonly jodi benson falls in love with him nyuckityyuck nwhats most pathetic about this film is how dull it is nyou do nt need to be cynical college student to be able to see right through this film which is another in long line of cheap attempts at making quick buck by disney who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry halfassedly remixing classics or nonclassics for distribution to the general public who sadly eats it all up nearlier in they released jungle jungle an adaptation of really awful french film un indien dans la ville which yeah improved over the original but not by much ndisneys in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now only creatively nin the rush to ship out film for distribution disney has forgotten to give this film little thing called magic nsuch scenes as dancing flubber flying car basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze delight or even cause people to laugh ni sat there the entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice and shaking my head at all the bad jokes nwho could really laugh at scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ndidnt think so nit does nt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable nphilip is not lovable absent minded professory just really dumb man being played by robin williams nwilliams is brilliant comic actor okay brilliant actor in general but here he given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something and other times act sad nthose times he not bad nbut what are we supposed to think of man who forgotten his wedding thrice nmaybe it was funny andor respectable in the ni like disney and usually enjoy their films not only animated but live action and their recent films save for hercules which was good but not great have been worse than lackluster they ve been pathetic jungle jungle is probably the worst film saw last year flubber probably second nwhat do they need to do nperhaps create something new nget writers who can write something that universally entertaining nfilms like the parent trap and mary poppins are films that are live action or in the latter case mix of both but even can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children but to be fun to adults nwhats more torturous that taking child to film that insults you and annoys you at every turn nand my god could nt they have done something else with edie mcclurg

bapparently when crap calls jim carrey answers nhere he is mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time his second goaround in the role of pet detective ace ventura nthat means more talking asscracks penis jokes and cries of alllllllllllrighty then nit all adds up to sequel that makes the original resemble schindlers list in terms of dramatic merit or lack of ngranted there are few laughs amid the constant barrage of preschool humor but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle nits painful experience for anyone with brain nace is distraught after accidentally dropping racoon into canyon in parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallones cliffhanger jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like college professor in terms of intellect or lack of and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain higher level of consciousness or in his case level of consciousness nbut he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of to retrieve sacred white bat for an african tribe nwhy africa nso carrey can disguise himself nude inside fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as tourist family watches look the rhinos about to give birth nif that seems like heehaw humor to you by all means see the movie nif not claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us nobviously there are quite few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie like the first ace ventura film use the word film only because it was filmed not because there any level of artistic merit huge success nin fact carrey only has career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture nyou may say to me but andrew look at jerry lewis nhe was born with negative nand look how popular he was thirty years ago nmaybe but still say jerry lewis is notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in movie of rabid bulldog biting off mans testicles nlewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over
bit has been years since terrence malick film hit theaters nhis new film the thin red line is strange beautiful enigmatic mess of movie nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast nit is filled with abovethetitle stars nthe cast for the most part gives great performances njohn travolta whose role is nothing more than cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve ngeorge clooney whose role became cameo in editing gives strange performance none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through characters narration nthe rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic nthese actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick nterrence malick is cinematic legend nhe has often been called the salinger of cinema nhis two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures nafter he made them he disappeared for years nthis film marks his return nwhat he made with the thin red line is film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment nthe narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such ofthemoment thoughts as scared nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as canvas on which many stories are painted nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on hill na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult because the story is fractured nmany stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately fault nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into box shook the box and poured the results onto table nthis basically creates mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed nim not declaring that the film has no structure nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about minutes of combat nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display mastery of filmmaking nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice nthis film uses color and light in such fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video nultimately malick has crafted film that is movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature nwhile some have said that the antiwar message and pronature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it can not ever honestly be called childish nafter seeing the thin red line was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again
bit seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality nits exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh njim carreys signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth nsuch protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just could nt take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie is nt funny nits not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them nthis of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy is nt above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks nsome have suggested that this is nt problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor does nt require plot to work ntheyre wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort there something about mary outside providence was technically an earlier project nthe brothers earlier film was nt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleightofhand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes nbut they have nt come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the getgo think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you have nt already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value its no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it has nt been elevated to another funnier level and it has nt been dropped either nthats too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions nthis does nt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on so they do nt have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script does nt go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nits great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey does nt pull any stunts we do nt expect him to pull and the farrellys script does nt give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting are nt set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellwegers irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut do nt believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ill still consider me myself irene to be highcaliber misfire
bthe most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike movie it is ni mean that as the highest compliment nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle yearold romance want to run and hide nthe sex scenes would be handled as farce producers would shed years off the characters ages so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence nalong with charming romantic story the australianbelgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas charles bud tingwell learns that his true love claire julia blake lives nearby nthey decide to catch up on old times but soon find themselves in reinvigorating affair ncomplicating matters is andreas frail health and claires longtime husband terry norris who ca nt understand why he suddenly become obsolete nin my mind the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire than the feelings of everyone involved njohn claires husband endlessly questions what he did wrong nclaire initially insists she grownup but admittedly behaves like child prospect that thrills and disappoints her nandreas an agnostic begins to question his fate message cox delivers in memorable dream sequence ncox litters the movie with flashbacks including the repeated vision of roaring train nits reminder of andreas and claires past love as young lovers they met by train but as it recurs we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed na pall is cast on the whole affair na master of the understated cox strings together series of memorable moments nin andreas dream sequence amidst the roar of the train and conversations we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love nwe also get glimpses into john and claires relationship nduring silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward claire admits to john about her indiscretion telling more than any monologue could nall that heard is the scraping of forks against plates nthe characters are unlike anything ve seen they re people nso many times movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky nor they re reduced to comedic buffoons nordinary people with pile of emotions claire and andreas are nt sure what the next step is nthey do want to be happy which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they ve known throughout their adult lives nbravo to cox who wrote the script for not making john monster so that claires affair is automatically justified nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult to accept nwe feel for him nhes decent man nsure he may have become complacent but he never expected this especially now nwith so much presented to the audience its only expected that the material gets little drawn out and repetitive which it does nhowever in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers cox displays skill and lan is nt likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
bjamaica is hot vacation spot nthe exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth approximately jamaican dollars to one american the sea is brilliant blue the air is warm but lacks humidity nand as tourism is unfortunately jamaicas biggest trade foreigners enter and leave with sense of relaxation nlife and debt takes brassy look at life inside this impoverished country nwhile normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music this film guides the viewer with sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface nthe voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid nit guides the audience along tourists journey and the story of the native inhabitants ninstead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen it quips you do nt see what happens after you flush the toilet nthis engages viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there nthis strong sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film nstephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals nthis is nt just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life npeople are interviewed from all sectors of occupation from field to factory as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country nthe variety of discussion perpetuates compelling internal dialogue with any viewer whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not nof course as can be expected the united states is slammed owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank nofficials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaicas economy will help the country back on its feet but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word nthe next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the is forcing on the citizens nadmittedly some of the back and forth between the businessminded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument nbut jamaica is nt against the united states and this documentary does not accuse the of being the sole perpetrator of its grief nif anything it begs for better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations
living out loud is the type of motion picture we do nt often see it is film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grownup clothing and parade around acting like immature sevenyearolds njudith holly hunter fortysomething living in new york city has been having difficult time with life lately nshe is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband martin donovan who had been cheating on her nshe can not sleep haunted by terrible memories often imagines offthewall things to try and make the world seem like better place and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers liz bailey queen latifah perform at local club njudiths life does start to brighten little when one night when she gets home to her apartment late strikes up conversation with the elevator operator pat danny devito lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently nboth of them create sort of emotional connection with each other seeking comfort with the other person but while pat starts to form deep love for her judith only wants to remain friends living out loud which was written by richard lagravenese the bridges of madison county who is also making his directing debut here is wonderful film from beginning to end one that is honest genuinely funny and poignant nthe three central characters that of judith pat and liz are all written to be freethinking complex human beings and are all likable but flawed people who are constantly interesting as is the film itself none highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen nsometimes it results in comedy and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching none sequence that stands out is when judith is at restaurant by herself reading novel nan older woman comes over to her mentions that that is great book she is reading and then goes over to join her own friends nas the woman sits down she looks over to see judith by herself and motions for her to come join them ninstantly we realize this was simply in judiths mind as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends nholly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here nhunter of course was brilliant in the piano for which she won an academy award but in this film she is even better think nshe finds the right note for each scene and holds it nand devito has never had such humanistic role before which was surprised about nusually he is used as the butt of joke or as caricature but in this film has livingandbreathing sympathetic person to play ntopping it all off is latifah also singer who is quickly turning into respectable actress herself and has juicy natural supporting role as in some ways judiths role model nanother joy of the film is that it does not somehow form contrived happy ending but in staying with its realistic tone manages to be upbeat but truthful nthe last shot is an especially powerful image nnothing is said but just the image of someone walking down sidewalk says it all nthe relationship that results between judith and pat is truetolife and sincere nas we watch these two people talk and get to know each other all that we wish for them both is to be happy even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved nand as living out loud which is one of the best films of the year proves sometimes friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for
brated for strong language sexual dialogue drug use crude humor violence and brief nudity nstarring ben affleck matt damon linda fiorentino salma hayek alan rickman chris rock kevin smith jason mewes jason lee george carlin alanis morissette nrunning time minutes nbeing huge fan of kevin smith was expecting lot out of his newest project dogma nit might just be kevins best work to date nits very funny with smart and foulmouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ it actually tries to tell people that there is such thing rather than that there is nt nin little movie premiered at sundance nthis little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become huge video sensation nyou really ca nt meet person on this green earth who has not seen clerks nit was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon sequel is coming nin kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly thought it was not the best movie ever made it was pretty good little flick nit was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in chasing amy came out and was kevins biggest success to date nnow in we get great little movie by the name of dogma nwow what cast nok here is the plot in this movie linda fiorentino plays regular woman who works at an abortion clinic none day at her house metatron the voice of god appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels matt damon and ben affleck from getting back into heaven by ways of church nok now get this she is told to find two prophets one who talks lot and one who does nt however she gets jay and silent bob instead who give us great performances nnow on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the th apostle falls out of the sky chris rock and helps guide her to find these angels nsalma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way nazrael jason lee who is demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win nbethany linda fiorentino has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith nwhat movie it is everything rolled into one an offensive offbeat smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has great message at the end and ends up being feelgood movie nwho would have known kevin had such soft side on him that could make us know that he is faithful person himself nnow for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart nyes it may target the catholic community and bash them lot but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven it actually goes with god and kevin gives message that there is god nthis review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie nkevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie nof course the best and funniest of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob nprobably the best characters in movies that like nthe starstudded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after while nthe script was written by kevin smith with many fwords in there of course and strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what is nt and makes us laugh at the same time as we think nchris rock gives hilarious performance and gets into his character very well with some classic lines nlinda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is nof course jason mewes and kevin smith do great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay as well as silent bob nalan rickman jason lee salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles nbeing oscar winners for the classic good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just little held back and to me did not give it all he could nben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story nthe movies only big flaw is that it has few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it nhowever the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members dogma stands as new classic and think can safely compare it to clerks nwhile being funny at times in the end it becomes serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but ca nt deny it ndogma will offend people especially deeply religious people but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you nall kevin smith fans must see
