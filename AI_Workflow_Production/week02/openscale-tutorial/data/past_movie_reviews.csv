"b'can you say "" dated "" ? \nyou can if you\'ve seen rosemary\'s baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . \n "" mystery science theater 3000 "" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the "" good "" ones too . \nrosemary\'s baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . \nit all seems so harmless in the beginning . \nmia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . \n ( there\'s also a skull in the living room , but it\'s only for decoration . ) \ntheir elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming . \nall\'s well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors\' chocolate mousse and passes out . \nwhen she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen . \nit seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it . \nand everyone\'s helping with the pregnancy . \nthe neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who\'s been in the business 66 . 6 \nyears . \nmeanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight . \nbefore too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries . \nthat\'s when you know your health\'s failing . \nthe only person in the movie who\'s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . \nby about the two-hour mark i felt the same way . \nrosemary\'s baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that\'s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie . \ni guess someone put a spell on this movie . \n'",0
"b'where do i begin ? \nokay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . \nin fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years . . . \nor even a decade . \nthis is bad beyond belief . \ni would * not * suggest paying money to see this . \nthere\'s a good chance you\'ll regret it . \nif you see it for free , you could still want to walk out . \ngo right ahead . \nthe movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of . . . buenos aires . \nhere we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life . \nbefore long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined . \nthey train . \nthey strut around nude for no reason whatsoever . \nafter an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs . \nthe big bugs look nice , even though their design is only "" okay . "" \nunfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway . \ncue more agony . \nthen some characters have sex . \nthen some more die . \n * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * \ncue more agony . \nthe movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home . \nunfortunately , after that torture , they can\'t think straight , don\'t pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks . \nyou remember how batman & robin was bad ? \nwell , batman & robin kicked this movie\'s sorry butt , people . \nstarship troopers does not succeed as an action movie . \nit does not succeed as a drama . \nit does not succeed as a war movie . \nit does not succeed as a comedy . \nit does not succeed as a satire . \nit does not succeed as a parody . \nit succeeds as being horrible . \nterrible . \ngut-wrenchingly bad . \ni wanted to run away from that movie every minute . \nbut i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . \nso i stayed . \nit never got better . \nfrequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * . \nthe movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it\'s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 . the whole thing feels like a movie that only three-year-olds could enjoy . . . \nexcept for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity . \nit\'s written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it . \nof course , i recommend the same for everyone . \ndon\'t go anywhere near it . \nverhoeven\'s got a streak going now . \nhis last movie was showgirls . \nhe seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming . \nshowgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it\'ll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross-wise . \nis it really * all * bad ? \nwell , no . \ntroopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the "" do you want to know more ? "" \ncommercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . \nso that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture . \ni\'m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie . \nbut i do admit it . \nso , if you\'re willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it . \ni don\'t know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own . \nfeel free to give it a shot . \nof course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don\'t recommend it . \nbut guess what ? \nalien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away . \nthough opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it\'ll be difficult to find someone that * won\'t * like alien resurrection when they\'ve seen it . \nthis is possibly the year\'s best intense action film , or at least * one * of the best . \nif you really want to see alien warfare that\'s played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection . \nplease , avoid this . \n'",0
"b'seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . \nif there\'s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . \nand if there\'s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , "" tomorrow never dies "" is it . \nopening sequences almost always make or break action films . \nwhen done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . \nthis film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . \nfirst there\'s a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . \nthere\'s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . \nwhen the scene ends in tragedy , it\'s clear there\'s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? \nthe film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . \nas the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . \nhe single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! \nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . \nit\'s not about the payoff because it\'s obvious bond will escape , instead , it\'s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . \nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term "" villain "" sounds passe ) . \nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . \njonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . \nthrough some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . \nnot only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . \nsurprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . \nthe film\'s hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . \nthe story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . \nsomehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . \nthe chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . \nthe two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . \nalthough "" tomorrow never dies "" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . \n'",1
"b'call "" hush "" "" stop or my mom will kill . "" \nor "" mommy fearest . "" \nor "" the hand that robs the cradle . "" \ncall it whatever you want , but certainly don\'t see it unless you\'re in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . \nchalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given "" hush "" a send-off that\'s downright infuriating . \nit\'s too bad that "" hush "" is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . \npaltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family\'s horse farm/estate kilronan . \njackson\'s mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . \nbut it seems that martha\'s friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she\'s what you\'d call someone who loves too much . \nmartha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she\'s concerned . \nif there\'s one reason to catch "" hush , "" it\'s lange . \nshe treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field . \nwhen she delves into martha\'s dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn\'t there , poking a hole in helen\'s diaphragm so she\'ll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it\'s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . \nveteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson\'s wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . \nthe rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow . \nbut can you really blame them ? \nthe character relationships in "" hush "" hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . \nidiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( "" why did you yell ? "" \nhelen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . \nyou can see through a great deal of martha\'s actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? \ndoes nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? \nif any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , "" hush "" would be a really short movie . \nand then there\'s the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . \nafter a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . \ni won\'t spoil what happens next except to say that it\'s contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i\'m no doctor ) medically impossible . \nthe final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever . \nit\'s just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . \nno one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . \nperhaps "" hush "" \'s title is a plea to silence its audience\'s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater . \n'",0

"b'this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . \nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . \nit is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . \nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn\'t mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . \nthe introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . \nray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . \nray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . \nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . \nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you \nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don\'t make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . \ndesperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a "" sure thing "" at freehold raceway . \nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . \nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . \nhe is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . \nso when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? \nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . \nas for ray\'s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . \nhis buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . \nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . \nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . \nbecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . \n'",0
"b' "" virus "" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . \nstrangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , "" deep rising , "" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . \nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989\'s "" leviathan , "" 1989\'s "" deep star six , "" and all four "" alien "" pictures . \n "" virus , "" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn\'t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . \nbased on a series of comic books , "" virus "" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . \nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . \nonce the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . \nafter turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . \none survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . \nif "" virus "" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you\'re correct . \nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn\'t appear to have a brain in its head . \nthe film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the "" creature "" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . \nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . \nin her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . \nalthough 1998\'s "" halloween : h20 "" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . \ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994\'s "" the puppet masters , "" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" where he was fabulous . \nthe last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . \nbasically , "" virus "" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . \nit is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? \nas long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never . \n'",0
"b'synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs . \nin the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper\'s obituary column , and kills her cat . \ncomments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . \none wouldn\'t think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( "" saturday night live "" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . \nnot only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . \nwhat was she thinking ? \nnever talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . \nshe receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . \ntwo men woo her ; tony the "" security consultant "" wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . \na lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . \n86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . \na good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . \nwhy would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? \nthat\'s one of the film\'s mysteries which are never answered . \nregardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . \nthey also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that\'s * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . \nalso , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they\'re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they\'re out playing in the snow before having sex . \nthe filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah\'s "" character development .

"b'tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . \nall those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . \nif you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . \nit\'s hilarious . \nhow does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? \neasy . \nwrite an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . \nwill and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . \nat night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . \nthe only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . \nthe script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . \ntheir flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . \ngrieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . \nwhat follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . \nthe music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez\'s born to be alive . \nthe choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin\' alive . \nit is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . \none of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will \nand chris don\'t have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . \nan art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . \nit\'s a scene that\'s an approximate parody of the vinegar\'s own rolf luedeke\'s editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . \nted "" unabomber "" \nkaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . \nof course , the script wouldn\'t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . \nnevertheless , will\'s father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . \nduring the wedding ceremony , will\'s heart isn\'t exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . \ndefinitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . \ni found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi\'s head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . \nthe scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . \nmore art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . \nthe idiots\' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks \ndon\'t play well anymore ( she\'s a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . \ni recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in \nneed of a lot of laughs . \ngo with a date . \nbrandi laughed non-stop , as i \ndid , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes . \n'",1
"b""well , what are you going to expect ? \nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \nin this movie , they're both . \nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \nthere are no standout performances here . \neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \nabsolutely ridiculous . \na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \neeeewwwww . \nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \nno such luck . \nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \n""",0

"b'the "" disney stick-to-what-you-do-best "" rule states that disney\'s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids\' entertainment , they will fail miserably . \nthis goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? \ni\'m still trying to forget ) . \nthat rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children\'s film . \nit will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . \nit\'s films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . \njust as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "" role "" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . \nhe dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . \nbut after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . \njohn breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda\'s father . \ndr . brenda has been working on a "" gadget project , "" which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime . \nfeeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . \nnow , when he says "" go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] "" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . \nin the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor\'s father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown\'s worst nemesis . \nclaw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . \nhughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . \nstate of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . \nhad they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . \nwhat we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . \npart of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . \ncan kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams "" hey ! \nyou ran a stop sign !

"b'i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984\'s "" the company of wolves , "" to 1992\'s "" the crying game , "" and 1994\'s "" interview with a vampire . "" \nhis latest film , "" the butcher boy , "" is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming . \ntold through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . \nhis father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore . \nfrancis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder . \nthe premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works . \nfrancis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . \nthis is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well . \nthe fact that we don\'t get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay . \nthe supporting characters are no help , though . \nrea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter . \nhe usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout . \nshaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . \nand singer sinead o\'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . \nthe pacing is all off in , "" the butcher boy .

"b""do the folks at disney have no common decency ? \nthey have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . \nwasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? \nobviously not . \ninspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . \nyounger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . \nthe movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . \nall the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite . \nas a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . \nin the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . \nwe never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . \nas a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . \nwith the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . \nrupert everett ? ! \nonly now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . \nhe sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version . \nit helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . \nwhen all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . \nhe does still have his cat , though . \nin the title role , matthew broderick looks lost . \nthe actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers . \nbroderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . \nhe has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . \nbut one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . \njohn courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . \nin a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . \nand so is born inspector gadget . \nas bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . \nbroderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . \nand there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' \nalas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . \nthere are so many tired plot additions . \ngadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . \nhughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . \nboth are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . \nwell , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . \nand don't even get me started about the villains . \ni didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . \nthe characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . \npenny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . \nthe special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . \nthe problem here lies solely in the script . \nperhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . \nhere is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway . \n""",0

"b' "" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn\'t help but be won over by the material . \nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone\'s terror , she is killed . \nas robert puts it : "" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . "" \nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \n "" okay , there is only one option now . \nyou can forget about calling the police , "" he says . \nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \n "" very bad things , "" which is actor peter berg\'s feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , "" there\'s something about mary , "" wanted to be . \nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn\'t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \nthere\'s more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , "" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , "" i couldn\'t help but crack up at how "" balls-to-the-wall "" this film had become . \njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern\'s wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \nit is at this level that , "" very bad things , "" was so entertaining and surprising . \njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : "" very bad things , "" is not a movie for everyone . \nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and "" safe "" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \n'",1
"b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\'s story . \nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\'s length . \ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \nthe viewers don\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy . \nonly a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\'ve worked from a different approach . \nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \n'",1

"b'[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh\'s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . \nas it happens , it didn\'t take long . ] \nis there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? \nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968\'s romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . \nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . \nit might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . \nat first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . \nthe hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . \nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . \nthe plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . \nit is zeffirelli\'s genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . \nin this italian master\'s hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son\'s worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . \nafter all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? \nwhat seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . \nwho could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a "" lethal weapon "" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? \nfranco zeffirelli , that\'s who . \nand it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . \nwhat gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . \nhis line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . \nhis movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . \nthis is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film\'s end . \nglenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet\'s mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i\'m still trying to understand the character as written . \n ( zeffirelli\'s incestuous interpretation of hamlet\'s relationship with his mother doesn\'t help . ) \nalan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . \nby and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . \nof special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . \nboth support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare "" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! "" \ni particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . \nperhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare "" definitive .

"b""you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \n""",1
"b'dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . \nto boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . \nmovies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . \nalex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . \nat times it moves beyond film into artwork . \nit is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . \nthese aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . \nthey are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . \nduring this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . \nwithout a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . \ni don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . \nit ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . \nmurdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . \nshadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . \nwe see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . \na great entrance . \nhowever , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . \nthe city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . \nblade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . \nit is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . \nother science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . \nwe ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . \ndark city is not so easily explained away . \nas the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . \nwhere is reality ? \ndark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . \nperhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . \nanyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it . \n'",1
"b'look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . \nsome sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . \n>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . \nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \nmaybe that\'s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\'s why there\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\'re completely unaware . "" \nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\'s it\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \nthe "" road not taken "" approach isn\'t just a plot device , either . \nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \nshe doesn\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\'s infidelity . \njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \nit shouldn\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\'s in . \npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . "" \nbut it\'s not all in the dialogue . \nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \n'",1
"b'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \noh , and it\'s rated g . \nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \n "" did you do it ?

"b""this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . \neddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . \nliving in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . \nmaureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . \non his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . \ntheir manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . \nlike a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . \ntheir relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . \nshe wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . \nduring one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . \nshe leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . \nshe lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . \nhe lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . \nduring this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . \nher life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . \njoey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . \nshe chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . \nbut the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . \nmaureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . \nperhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing . \n""",0
"b'i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . \ni\'m big fan of perry\'s subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley\'s on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . \nso naturally , when the trailer for "" almost heroes "" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . \na soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley\'s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry\'s big breakthrough . \ni was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley\'s best , in spite of david spade\'s absence . \ni was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . \nsadly , none of this came to pass . \nthe humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . \nperry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it\'s his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . \nand the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it\'s a farley flick . \nthe movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . \nperry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . \nand farley\'s classic humor is widespread , too . \nalmost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . \nguys , let\'s leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? \nstick to "" tommy boy "" , and we\'ll all be "" friends "" . \n'",0
"b'having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \naside from the fact that it\'s a milestone in animation in movies ( it\'s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it\'s also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger\'s mind back on work . \nmaroon thinks that roger\'s wife , jessica\'s , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake\' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger\'s good name . \nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who\'s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . \' \n`who framed roger rabbit\' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins\' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit\' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

"b""some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch . \nthen there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . \nthe real mccoy is both . \nit's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . \nthe real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job . \nsix years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight . \nshe soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen . \nj . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him . \nschmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery . \nthis time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son . \njust when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . * \ncontrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . \nleading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins . \nthere is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in . \nkaren's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility . \nit would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment . \nsmall world , eh ? \nthen there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage . \nhowever , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day . \nbut the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne . \nthere is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character . \nkaren is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material . \nschmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture . \nonly kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . \nin fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot . \ni might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . \nvarious scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor . \neven the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes . \nthere is no tension in the scene , just tedium . \nrussell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room . \nthere are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones . \nlike karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing . \nlike a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later . \ntempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation . \n""",0
"b'i am a steven seagal fan . \ni only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\'s been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \nhe\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\'t broke , why fix it ? \n ( more on this disappointed person\'s dashed expectations later ) . \nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing . \nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \nit\'s the other changes that disappoint . \nfor example , although there\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\'s "" in living colour . "" \nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \ntoo much . \nseagal\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \nthat\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \nwe trusted him . \nwe got to know him . \nnow , betrayal . \ni don\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\'s going to try to be funny again . \ni\'ll try , but it won\'t be easy . \nif you haven\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \nit\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \nafter all , if we can\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \nmufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . \neverybody makes mistakes once in awhile . \n'",0
"b'aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads . \nthe skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again . \nwhen sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson . \nwaiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang . \nas he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence . \nrandolph kret\'s script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film\'s producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance . \nthe film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can\'t help but be disgusted by the events presented within . \ni\'ve seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher\'s film was trying to define a generation . \nkret\'s film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one . \nif fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w . \ngriffith ( thematically speaking ) . \nthere is not a single likable character in the film . \nthe skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) . \nthe african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost . \neven gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads\' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects . \nthe main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge . \nwhat all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society . \nthe cast of this film is absolutely remarkable . \ndamon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can\'t seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful . \nhis initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend\'s suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film . \ndavid lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) . \nwilson\'s character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly . \nsadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage . \nward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed . \nnote : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism . \nthe message about hatred couldn\'t be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation . \nthere are no "" winners "" at the end of this film either . \nno character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began . \nwhere american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah\'s band of twisted souls . \nit is this bleak ending that carries the film\'s most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely . \n'",1

"b""this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . \njoseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . \nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . \nthe beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . \nthe beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . \nthis is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . \njoshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . \nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . \nthe plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . \nhis answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . \nthis search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist . \nnow , that's a smart kid . \nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . \none of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . \nthroughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) \nquestion about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . \nnothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . \nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . \nthe film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) \ntells him his grandfather is all right . \nhis quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . \nmaybe that's for another film down the road . \nthis part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . \nas this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . \nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . \nwell , god bless him , if he can do that . \nthis is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . \nit's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . \nand that family of his , they're too good for words . \nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . \nfor those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . \n""",0

"b""it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . \nwhy ? \nthe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . \ni got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' . \nbut no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster . \nthis is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . \nyou have been warned . \nof course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . \nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . \nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . \nof course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . \nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . \nthat term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . \nif i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . \nsinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . \nthe academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . \nafter a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . \nsuddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . \nfor some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . \nthe team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . \nimmediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . \nlet's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . \nit is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . \ni'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . \ninstead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . \nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ? \ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? \nstill , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak . \ndepalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? \nc'mon ) . \nthere's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . \nit's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . \nas mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . \nmaybe even cheated . \nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . \nothers muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked .

"" \nsure , "" starship troopers "" qualifies as cinematic junk food , but that\'s forgivable when the junk food is this tasty . \neveryone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall\'s onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and "" troopers "" does the job admirably despite its flaws . \nfor its first hour , "" starship troopers "" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of "" saved by the bell "" and "" g . i . \njane . "" \nin the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up . \nbut there\'s temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny\'s is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) . \npersonal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny\'s parents and destroying his home . \nour weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens\' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good . \nbut the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy . \nthe exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans . \nonce we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , "" starship troopers "" really kicks into high gear . \nits last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show . \nthe creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point . \nit\'s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren\'t too derivative of the titular menace from "" alien . "" \nthese monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that\'s all sharp talons and even sharper legs . \nthey attack in packs of hundreds , and it\'s a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess . \nit matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying . \nthe occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member\'s death , the final resolution to johnny\'s love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how "" starship troopers "" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters . \nthese bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm\'s length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la "" star wars , "" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality . \nthe acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on "" beverly hills 90210 "" and/or "" melrose place "" -- and it occasionally shows . \nvan dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable . \nin smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny\'s best friend and jake busey ( gary\'s son ) as johnny\'s sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see "" the frighteners "" or "" contact "" ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana . \n "" starship troopers "" is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn\'t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994\'s howler "" the puppet masters . "" \nbut the overall familiarity to the "" alien "" trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer . \nits own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation "" alien : resurrection "" opens in a few weeks . \nwe will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . \n'",1
"b'way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . \none of the good ones is ryan phillippe\'s surprisingly halfway decent performance . \nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year\'s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he\'d fallen for his "" target "" . \nit was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film\'s director could negotiate . \nbut he seems to be trying and that shouldn\'t be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn\'t required to do much but look pretty . \nhere , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory . \nit\'s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . \nunlike ben affleck\'s puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . \nas for the plot , well , that\'s one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she\'s carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . \nthe kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . \nbut the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . \ndirected by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . \nunlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn\'t seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i\'ve seen before and worse , it feels like it . \nthe film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . \nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . \neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn\'t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it\'s even more self consciously "" dramatic "" . \nusual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . \nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . \nthus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn\'t see it coming , and i smiled . \nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . \nor substance . \nit\'s just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . \neven the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction "" are clever . \nat one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass "" . \ni\'ve seen porno with better dialogue . \nand some with better plot lines too . \nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . \ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . \nbenicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . \nspeaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . \nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he\'s only kept around for his cold presence . \ntaye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . \nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo\'s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . \nit\'s vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about "" faggots "" migrating to los angeles . \nyou know the routine . \nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . \nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder . \njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry\'s fetishized smith and wesson . \noh how far we\'ve come . \n'",0
"b'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \nwilde\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \nand that\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \nit\'s been said that todd haynes\' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that\'s true . \nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \nstructure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \nthis is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn\'t aspire to be : it doesn\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \nthere\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \nthrough discussions with slade\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \nhaynes demonstrates that he\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby\'s on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\'s , have a rare visual flair that\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \nwith brian eno\'s famous "" needle in the camel\'s eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \nit has a distance that\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \nthis movie\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \nthe music is especially notable . \nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\'s manager ( who challenges slade\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \nrhys meyers\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \nbale\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him . \nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . \ntheir story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . \nthe story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he\'s the everyman , and when you can\'t totally identify with the everyman , your story\'s in slight trouble . \nas a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good . \nit never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . \nit\'s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . \nthe beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . \nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? \nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . \nstill , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn\'t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you\'ve lived it , what else is the point when you\'ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) . \nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . \n'",1
"b'devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven\'s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein\'s novel than it is a literary satire . \nthe author\'s jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . \nand i suppose that\'s exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . \nheinlein\'s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . \noutlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it\'s basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . \nsometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . \namong those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . \nwhile carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from "" beverly hills 90210 . "" \nso if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? \nfor one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . \nthe very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . \nif starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . \nit\'s a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it\'s a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it\'s worth . \nthe no-name cast also plays into verhoeven\'s treatment of heinlein\'s most controversial conceit . \nin this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . \nverhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era "" why we fight "" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . \nthese characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . \nit\'s not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . \nin fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . \nverhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he\'s making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . \nif that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it\'s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . \nthere may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody\'s business . \nverhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . \nit is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn\'t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . \ni wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn\'t work out that way . \nthat would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . \n'",1

"b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \ndunne doesn\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \nit wasn\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\' character and another train passenger . \nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \nalso very impressive is the film\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\'s dinosaur ) . \nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers . \nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\'t seem to figure out why he\'s been depressed for the last few years . \nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\'s tutelage . \njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \nrobin wright penn\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \nout of all the characters , jeremy\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending . \nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" \nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \nit\'s not that the ending is bad , it\'s just that the ending doesn\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\'s did . \nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\'t reveal the ending here , but you\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \nas long as it isn\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \none thing seems clear , though . \nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \n'",1
"b""long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . \none of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . \nthis opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . \nhitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month . \nstopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there . \nnovalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . \na wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . \nthen the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . \nthis film is terrible . \nthe directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . \nwe get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . \na disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . \na subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . \nan embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . \ntaking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . \naltogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . \nhowever , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? \nno one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . \n""",0

"b' "" through a spyglass , i could see everything . "" \nking louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer\'s the lady and the duke observes from afar . \nconsider it a view to a kill made abstract . \na proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . \nthe maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , "" i don\'t know , "" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . \nwhat we don\'t see might not be able to hurt us . \njust close your eyes and think of england . \nduring times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \nadapted from elliott\'s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer\'s latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace\'s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king\'s hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke\'s sister-in-law on a stake . \nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \nwhen grace sees her friend\'s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer\'s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman\'s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist\'s escape . \ngrace doesn\'t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \nthe duke is called to vote on the king\'s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \nthat\'s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer\'s characters occasionally become didactic . \nrohmer\'s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer\'s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \nit looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron\'s debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . \nwhy ?

"b'it seems that i\'ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch . \ntake payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like . \nhowever , it\'s horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood\'s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . \nit was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn\'t his own . \nmel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn\'t like the ending and had another director reshoot it . \nwhat a crock . \nif you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . \nwhy film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don\'t like the ending . \nyou\'re fired . \nlet\'s get someone else to do it . \n- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . \nthe end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . \nwhich is to say that it\'s happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . \nin this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson\'s prize is a blond and money . \ni miss originality in film , i really do . \ni think audiences are so starved for it that they\'ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . \npayback\'s tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . \nwhile gibson\'s character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn\'t kill in front of children and protects his blond woman . \nthere\'s nothing bad about him - he\'s a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life . \nand gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . \nthe story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 . \ngibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less . \nhe makes a point of it that it\'s strictly 70 grand . \na real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest . \nthis idea is completely stretched out . \ngibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . \nwhat i didn\'t understand - this is the chicago mafia . \n$70 , 000 is like spare change to them . \nthey\'d probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . \ni think they\'d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 . \nmaybe i\'m being too hard on the movie . \nperhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . \ni read roger ebert\'s review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . \nthat\'s why we\'re allowed to root for him . \nand it\'s true - gibson walks the movie as if he\'s smiling at a joke he just heard . \nbut he\'s wrong here . \ni wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn\'t a comic , just an ass kicker . \nas a side note , i\'ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . \nafter this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? \nreally , i don\'t care . \ni\'m just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can . \n'",0
"b""lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by . \nmost are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot . \nperhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about . \nthe latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level . \nit's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back . \nalthough director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun . \nthat vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed . \nenemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie . \nenemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch . \nthe movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) . \nreynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee . \nreynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera . \nby an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies . \nit's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things . \nthe acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around . \nsmith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role . \nsmith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not . \nthe supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas . \nthis is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking . \n""",1

"b'in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . \nhe shows us how it isn\'t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . \non a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \nhowever , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \n "" i don\'t know who i\'m taking to , "" he tells her . \nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\'s pain , but also his own . \nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \nhe doesn\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \ncentral to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it . \naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \nof all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \nwhat egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous . \nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \n "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \n "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \nthe actual bus wreck itself doesn\'t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . \nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . \ncertainly one of the best films of 1997

"b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\'t a very good film . \nit\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \ni didn\'t hate it -- it\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\'s now caulder\'s job to find out of he\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\'s not acting , that he\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \nthe character himself isn\'t very interesting -- he\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\'s obsessed with his work ) . \nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\'s fine . \nthere\'s also the prison guard subplot . \nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \nthen there\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\'s because they\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\'s nest had . \nashton\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\'s in the shawshank redemption . \nhopkins\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \nand then there\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers , "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\'s in a compelling film . \nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \n'",0
"b'first troy beyer wrote the critically panned "" b . a . p . s . "" \nnow she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . \nthough not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . \nthe basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . \njazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . \nshe and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . \nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . \nthe fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . \nthere are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \nin a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . \nthat is not the case here . \nthe script suffers from random plot developments . \nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" \nat one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . \nwe are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don\'t care if she and her mother get along . \nwe\'ve never seen her mother before . \nwe never see her again . \nwho cares ? \nwhat\'s worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . \nat another point , a character announces that she can\'t have children . \napparently , this is devastating . \nwe wouldn\'t know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . \nthe scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . \nthese scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . \ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . \none scene is a lover\'s spat between two minor characters . \nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . \nthinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . \nbut it does . \nfirst , it is original . \nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . \nit\'s something i don\'t think has been the subject of a film . \nsecond , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . \ntaken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . \nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman\'s real experience . \nneither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . \nat some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . \ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their "" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , "" but on the whole , it\'s pretty bad . \nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \ni\'ll give beyer one more strike , and then she\'s out . \nrated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . \n'",0
"b'martin scorsese\'s films used to intimidate me . \nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \ni learned from scorsese\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \ni don\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \nit shouldn\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \nthe movie\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . "" \nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \nit\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\'s life is in danger if he stays . \nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \nthe story doesn\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \nit just doesn\'t fit that mold . \nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \nfor those who don\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \npeople won\'t be flocking to kundun for it\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \n'",1
"b""there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \nit is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \nbut i doubt that . \nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \n""",1
"b'_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . \nif you haven\'t heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven\'t seen it -- well , i suspect you\'re in a small minority ! \nfirst thing\'s first ? is it all it\'s hyped up to be ? \nwell , yes ? and no . \nit\'s a good film , and there\'s a lot to like about it , but it\'s not without its problems . \nwhen i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain\'t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \ni mean , what\'s happened to hollywood\'s script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn\'t alone in that respect . \nit\'s when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who\'d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \ni didn\'t see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn\'t think i\'d enjoy it much . \ndid i ? yes and no . \nmainly yes , i\'m happy to say . \nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\' course ! \n : - ) ) . \nwell , it\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \ndoes it work here ? \nin script form it doesn\'t add all that much to the story . \nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \nit\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\'s "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \nit\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \nthere\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\'s not going to be a happy ending . \nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \nwe all knew it was coming . \ni\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \nand it is an hour . \nmy goodness , we don\'t miss a second of that hour ? \ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\'s standards , i\'m sure there\'s been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films . \nbut i certainly wasn\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \nnot that i\'d expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" ) . \nis it overdone ? \ni thought so . \nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\'s second half . \nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \nyou really couldn\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\'s hand , while promising she\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \nso , we\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \nhaven\'t mentioned the script . \nplot-wise it\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\'ve a feeling that\'s to the actors credit if anything . \nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \nit\'s a period drama . \nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \ndid they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! "" \nback in the turn of the century ? \ni doubt it . \nwould someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? "" . \ni doubt it . \nis such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now "" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \nyes it is . \na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \nstick with directing , dude . \nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\'t she win that oscar ? ! \nafter all , they were throwing oscars at "" titanic "" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \ni haven\'t even mentioned james horner\'s beautiful score . \nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \n ; - ) \ni\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \nhell , don\'t talk to me about oscars . \nbloomin\' farce . \nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \nnope , i don\'t think so . \nit\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\'ve ever seen , but i don\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \nand as for the fact they\'re reportedly making a "" titanic 2 "" ? well i guess that\'s typical hollywood for you ! \n'",1
"b'being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . \nafter all , it\'s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . \nso one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . \ni was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . \nbut now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . \nafter watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . \nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . \nlawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o\'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . \nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . \nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . \nshot in panavision\'s famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . \nit is absolutely breathtaking . \nusing stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . \nevery shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . \ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . \nafter watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , "" i\'ve got to do a remake of this film !

"b""starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . \njunior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . \nthese are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . \nso foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . \nso much for hopes . \nschwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . \nunfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . \nstill believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . \nso , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . \ntheir theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . \ndoes the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? \nwell , it must have to the producers of junior . \nadmittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . \nperhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . \nbut it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . \nthe sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . \nschwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . \ni kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . \nbetter yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? \nanything would have been better than this mess . \ndanny devito is wasted in this movie . \nhis part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . \n ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) \nemma thompson is wasted here as well . \nwhile thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . \ntoo bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . \nam i being too hard on this film ? \ni don't think so . \nschwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . \nwith a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . \nthey certainly managed here . \nmaybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . \nif you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents . \n""",0
"b' "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\'t belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\'s jim stark does . \nnot only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \nthis is because times change and in response people change . \nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \neven if "" rebel without a cause "" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \n'",1

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \neast meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney\'s parade of annual animated feature films . \nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . \nthough not for lack of trying . \nin many respects , mulan is among disney\'s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . \nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child\'s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan\'s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? \nin an instant , idealistic mulan\'s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . \nthe film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family\'s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . \ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney\'s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film\'s vocal work , there\'s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can\'t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it\'s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it\'s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan\'s land . \nat its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \nas such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan\'s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine\'s character-defining opening half-hour . \nit\'s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \noff to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \nthey\'re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \nat training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \neverybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \nthe romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story\'s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \nanother staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \ncomposed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- "" i\'ll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \nonly "" reflections "" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre\'s most wondrously pure voices . \nnonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \nwhile the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they\'re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \nbriskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \n'",1
"b'anyone who saw alan rickman\'s finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . \nhowever , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock . \nnevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman\'s feature debut as a director , the winter guest . \nthe film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . \nthe result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . \nthe winter guest isn\'t about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it\'s about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . \nthe winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . \ninstead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . \nthey represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . \nwe see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . \nthere is comedy and tragedy . \nmost importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth . \nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . \nit\'s so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . \nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . \nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . \nthere are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest\'s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . \nthe first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . \nthese two have a stormy relationship . \nthey love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . \nmuch of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . \nfrances\' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . \non this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . \nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . \nonce they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don\'t go exactly as planned . \nlily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . \ndeath is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . \nit doesn\'t matter whether or not they knew the deceased . \nit\'s the ceremony that they\'re interested in . \nsam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . \nunlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . \nthey are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . \nthe acting is strong and believable . \nthe mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . \nthere is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . \nand , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . \nthe winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . \nfour of the film\'s principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . \nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . \nthe rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . \nin fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman\'s microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . \nif you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater . \n'",1

"b'based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won\'t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . \ncan you say . . . the \nthird times not a charm ? \nplot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation\'s top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . \ncritique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . \nwhen you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that\'s not a very good sign . \ni also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . \nwhen you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . \nand when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster . \nit blows . \nor as they say in french , "" eet blows "" . \ncould it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? \nmaybe . \ncould it be that most of the special effects don\'t show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don\'t see anything that its trailers hadn\'t already given away ? \nperhaps . \nor could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? \nnaaaaaaah ! \na bad movie is a bad movie . \non a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . \nbranagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that\'s pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . \nsmith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . \ni would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . \nthen again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh \nyeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997\'s summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996\'s independence day ( 6/10 ) . \nhe once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . \nkevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . \nthey have two kids together , greta simone and owen . \none of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has "" kasdan "" written on it . \nlawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . \nsalma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . \nshe made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders\' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez\'s desperado opposite antonio banderas . \nsince then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez\'s films . \nshe stands 5\'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . \none of the actresses cast as branagh\'s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . \nanother is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world\'s most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper\'s bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . \n'",0

"b""although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . \nbilly crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) \nben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . \nbut ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . \nall done in a comic fashion , of course . \nalthough never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . \nbilly crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . \nhe's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny . \nrobert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . \nhe's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . \nlisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen . \nthe supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) \nthe film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . \nit sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . \nspoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . \nthe italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . \nthere's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . \nit is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . \nunfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . \nharold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . \nall the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . \nthe script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . \nthe film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . \nanalyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . \nrobert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) \ncrystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . \nit's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated . \n""",1

"b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \n "" dr . \nstrangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \n "" men in black "" ) . \nwhat\'s unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \nif there\'s anything that affects americans the most it\'s politics and showbusiness . \nin this age of information and technology , we\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \nthat\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \nbrean , along with the president\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \nthey pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it\'s a country no one\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\'s riffing satire comes into play . \nwe\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \nthe characters\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \nsince it\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \nthis demonstrates the film\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \nbut then there\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , "" this is nothing ! "" \nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and "" wag the dog "" at least succeeds in this respect . \nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \nthen again , it\'s a valiant effort . \n'",1
"b'notting hill\'s trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . \nthe movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . \nand it apparently worked . \nperhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill\'s opening weekend success , but the film\'s staying power is based on word of mouth . \nallow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . \ngrant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . \ninto his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . \na common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . \ndays later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . \n ( aside : notting hill\'s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) \nonly anna\'s celebrity-or william\'s lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . \nrichard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture\'s "" beauty and the beast "" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . \nas with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it\'s william\'s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . \ncurtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple\'s situation is not enough to fuel two hours\' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill\'s finest moments revolve around william\'s eccentric friends and family . \nby now , dear reader , you\'ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans\' performance as william\'s imbecilic welsh flatmate . \nyes , he\'s a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . \nin the movie\'s best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max\'s latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . \nthe scene ends only as a british writer would end it . \nif anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot\'s dramatic impact . \nroberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings\' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they\'re lonely . \n ( worth noting in roberts\' and grant\'s favour : the ubiquitous "" i\'m just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her "" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) \nnotting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell\'s playful changing-of-the-seasons number . \nif only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . \n'",1
"b'in 1994 , an insider\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \ngovernor stanton\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby "" the dustbuster "" holden ( kathy bates ) . \nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\' wild performance alone . \nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \nin fact , most of the "" bad guys "" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\'s current troubles ) . \nprimary colors\' chief problem is its length . \nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \nthe scene\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \nthe extra length isn\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \nit\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \n'",1

"b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn\'t . \nit\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn\'t about the lack of these elements . \nit\'s about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\'s needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn\'t the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\'t even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\'s head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn\'t that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn\'t that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\'s acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don\'t even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! "" \nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \n'",1

"" \nwhich is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney\'s friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . \nthe cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . \nalso good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( "" the fonz "" ) as the school principal . \ni took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends\' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney\'s rival because she covered her mother\'s disappearance . \ni hate that show , i hate those actors . \nthey\'re untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn\'t . \n'",1
"b""`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . \nfor a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . \nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . \nbut , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . \nin these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . \n`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . \nin addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . \n`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . \ntykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . \nwith it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . \neven more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . \nas a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . \nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . \nmeanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . \nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty . \nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . \nthe other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . \nadditional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . \n`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . \nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . \nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . \nmost are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . \nbut , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . \na few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . \nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . \nperhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . \nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . \nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting . \n""",1

"" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it\'s not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i\'m surprised i didn\'t walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit\'s very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it\'s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser\'s attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn\'t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won\'t do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i\'m afraid that immature men might respond to the film\'s violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i\'m just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou\'ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid .

"b""salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . \nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . \nproof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . \nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . \none day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . \nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . \nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . \nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . \non the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . \nmartin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . \nunfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film . \n""",0

"b'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler\'s list . \nhowever , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . \none of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . \nunfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . \nalthough both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . \nwhen spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . \ntogether with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . \nironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy . \nbut in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . \nalthough very personal , spielberg\'s screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . \nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . \nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . \nthe story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . \nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . \nbecause of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . \nin the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . \nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . \nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . \ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . \nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . \nthe slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . \nbut , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . \nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . \nthe last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . \none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . \naliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . \nit is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks\' thing and byron haskin\'s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . \nspielberg\'s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . \nbut , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . \nthere lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . \nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock\'s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . \ndespite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . \nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . \nmelinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary\'s long-suffering wife ronnie . \napart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg\'s semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . \nthe aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . \ntoo convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . \naccording to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . \nso , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . \nthe result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . \nanyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . \n'",1
"b'in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . \nit angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . \nit ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . \nhaving endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . \ndoes men live up to its press ? \nwell , yes it does . \nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \nhoward is chad\'s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \nthe reason ? \nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \n "" it\'ll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says . \nhoward , helpless against the force of chad\'s will , agrees to the plan . \nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \nyou can guess which one she falls for . \nsoon a tragic lovers\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she\'s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \nhis evil is as subtle as a viper\'s , and as easy as his smile . \nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine\'s heart . \nhis character would be a joke if he wasn\'t so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \nhe\'s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won\'t describe . \nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \ncould it happen in the real world ? \nprobably not . \ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \nmaybe it\'s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \nthe marvel of labute\'s multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men\'s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \nby the end of the film you\'ll feel as if you\'ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn\'t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \n'",1
"b""at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . \nnow my view has completely changed . \nit's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . \nthe story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . \nthey meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . \nof course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . \nthus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . \nthe movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . \ni don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny . \nall the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . \none such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . \ncreative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . \na person can only take so much . \nwe do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . \nit's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . \nit's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . \nspeaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . \nsigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . \nit's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . \nit just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . \nalan rickman however was not so lucky . \nafter his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . \nit's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . \nwhen the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . \nlike many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . \ntimes it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . \nwhen will it stop ? \ni am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . \nit may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . \nis that too much to ask ? \nobviously it is . \nwhen galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . \naside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre . \nit's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining . \nthe only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond . \n""",0
"b'here\'s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler\'s list is to jurassic park . \nin 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\'s list as the director\'s "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \nthat film is amistad . \nalthough not as masterful as schindler\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \nwatching schindler\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\'s not a surprise . \nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\'s dramatic force . \non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \nthe first men to come to the africans\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\'s cause . \ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\'s success . \nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\'s seemingly-strange "" rituals "" . \nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \namistad\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . "" \nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \nfinally , there\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\'s list is this film\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \nschindler\'s list had ralph fiennes\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \nthere is no such figure in amistad . \nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \nit is to spielberg\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \namistad\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\'s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \n'",1

"b""notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \nif you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . \nstarring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \nexotica is very much worth seeing . \nit opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . \nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . \n""",1
"b""one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \n""",1
"b'eyes wide shut isn\'t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick\'s final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . \nit\'s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur\'s trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year ) . \nin an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . \nthey play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . \nhe is an m . d . , she\'s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . \nat the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . \nwhen they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . \nhe ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . \nthey proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . \nshe admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . \nbill is jolted by alice\'s story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient . \nthis turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . \nthe daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . \nhe almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . \nthen , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . \nerotic dread mounts as cruise ( who\'s not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider . \nmuch hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . \nwith the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating . \neuropean viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . \nroger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations . \ni am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene\'s mystical atmosphere . \nthe first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . \nthis is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . \nfrom the giant mansion used in the film\'s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford\'s apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . \nto boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . \nat the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . \nit looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . \nit\'s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . \nat the end , it seems , bill\'s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . \nkubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . \ntom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . \nnicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she\'s headed for an oscar nod . \nthe movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford\'s mysterious friend . \neyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . \nstill , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick\'s best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'",1
"b""near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \n""",1

\ni\'m sure that somewhere right now there\'s some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn\'t mean i need to know about it . \nyes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there . \nyes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn\'t look like we expect him to . \nyou said all that in 1995 . \nmove on . \nthis film serves no purpose . \nit doesn\'t entertain , it doesn\'t teach us anything , it doesn\'t make a statement beyond the obvious "" this stuff is bad "" approach . \nonly if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . \nthat\'s not likely to happen , though , so "" 8mm "" is indeed a scummy waste of money . \norson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , "" to movies . . . to \ngood movies "" . \nif only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . \nlike "" snuff "" films , "" 8mm "" should never have been made . \nnow , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . \nuseless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . \nhe used it in "" batman forever "" , in "" batman & robin "" , in "" a time to kill "" , in "" falling down "" , and it\'s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . . \n'",0
"b' "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . \nit takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that\'s totally believable throughout . \nthis isn\'t an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble\'s perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble\'s wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don\'t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble\'s innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn\'t spend much time on the details of kimble\'s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it\'s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . \nmost of the film deals with richard\'s complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy\'s script and davis\'s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don\'t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe\'re so relieved when justice is served . \nit\'s not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it\'s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . \nwatching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . \nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this . \n ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : "" nick of time "" ] \n'",1
"b'dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \ntotally trustworthy , right ? \nnot a chance . \nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \nbut neither side is trivialized . \nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : in "" sooner than you think "" america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs . \na dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them . \ncomments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? \nwhy , they\'re all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! \nthey also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron\'s aliens . \nyes , it\'s blade squad , the fox network\'s wednesday night movie of the week . \nthis "" movie , "" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars . \n "" how can a movie have guest stars ? "" \nyou may ask . \nwell , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . \nblade squad is dumb . \nblade squad is loud . \nblade squad is obnoxious . \nblade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . \nwhy not ? \nafter all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . \nso , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? \nto be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . \nthe film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . \ni\'d imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . \ni tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . \ni can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 . \nand , although this isn\'t saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book\'s terrific two-year beginning ) . \nbut , i digress . \ndespite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . \none , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer\'s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . \noh yeah , dylan\'s "" knockin\' on heaven\'s door "" and bowie\'s "" i\'m afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste . \ntwo , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . \nthe substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . \ncharacters\' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . \nduring one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . \nwhen a character spoke , the song\'s volume dropped but did not disappear . \nas soon as that character finished speaking , the song\'s volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . \nthis sounds trivial , i\'m sure , but it distracted me immensely . \nfinally , this is commercial television . \nfoul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . \nthus , don\'t use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . \nin an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . \nwhen the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car\'s horn off-screen to muffle the word out . \nin a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . \nperhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics\' 2099 series of comics . \nmake up a bunch of new bad words for the future . \nthis way , you don\'t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . \ncompared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . \nwhen compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs . \n ( review written august 12 , 1998 ) \n'",0
"b'ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? \nyou remember , he was the title character in that 70\'s sitcom , "" welcome back kotter . "" \nalways trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife\'s tuna casserole . \n "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" \nmr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . \nthat\'s right . \ni\'m not sure if it\'s his main source of income , but from what i\'ve heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . \nand there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . \nyou silly goose . \nwell , gabe kaplan isn\'t in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler\'s life . \nbut rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . \nsorry about the segue , or lack thereof . \nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . \nhe\'s been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . \nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . \nin the beginning of the film , he\'s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . \nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . \nmike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . \nmonths later , he\'s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . \nwhen mike\'s best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . \nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . \nto make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . \nthis is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . \nrounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . \nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent aren\'t very glamorous at all . \nthere\'s a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \nwe\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \ned norton\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\'re worth . \njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \nhe\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \nshe\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\'s reactions instead . \na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\'t find time for humor . \nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \n "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \nluckily , we\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\'s going on . \nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \nit\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \nwait ! \nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \nhang on ! \npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \nokay , i guess that\'s enough . \noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\'s mother . \n'",1
"b""this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . \na fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . \njason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . \nwhile he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . \nthe plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie . \nthe reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story . \nbut for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . \na bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp . \nthey are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids . \nsadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer . \nat this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . \nsince i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive . \ni will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries . \nif you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . \nthe only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work . \nusing as many methods of murder as they could . \nnone of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife . \nnope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . \none fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again . \nthe main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning . \nif not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan . \nfriday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot . \n""",0
"b'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\'t . \ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \nthis is the first star wars film i\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \nbasically , the film\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\'s ship . \nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \nwhat a klutz ! \ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \ni can\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \nthe film is a treasure to look at . \nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \nnot since 1997\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\'s classic silent metropolis . \nhowever , all the sets are so original . \nthe original star wars movies can\'t even match the grandeur of this film\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \nwhether its queen amadala\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \nas for john williams\' score , i don\'t think he\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\'t even remember . \nit is as epic as his schindler\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \nit is the best "" fun "" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \n'",1
"b'i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . \nit\'s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . \ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . \nin a word , it\'s the same thing that\'s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . \nmore to the point , it\'s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you\'re telling a story about a relationship . \nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we\'re expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they\'re attractive and pleasant . \nin this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o\'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . \nit\'s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . \nconvinced despite his reservations that it\'s time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . \nanne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . \njimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . \nthere are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy\'s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . \nit\'s a wacky , brewster\'s millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film\'s better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . \nat least that would be the case if jimmy weren\'t already a world-class altruist . \nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn\'t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . \nfrom the outset , jimmy\'s motivation isn\'t cash ; it\'s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . \nit\'s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor\'s plot development . \nby any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . \nand that\'s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . \nthere\'s never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there\'s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . \nthe blandly nice o\'donnell couldn\'t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don\'t even let him ; zellweger\'s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . \nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . \nthe parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they\'re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . \ni\'ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov\'s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . \nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . \nyou\'re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that\'s not the real problem . \nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it\'s leading up to . \nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there\'s no spark , no energy , no humanity . \nit\'s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer\'s digestions . \nwe\'ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don\'t even have a pulse . \nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins . \n'",0
"b'if you\'re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you\'re going to love the hunt for red october . \nyou\'ll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you\'re a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan\'s earlier films , die hard and predator . \nin fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . \nthe hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy\'s best selling novel . \nset in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october . \nthe nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . \nthe red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . \nramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . \nhe takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . \nis he planning to start world war iii ? \ncia analyst jack ryan doesn\'t think so ; he\'s convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . \nthe characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . \nbaldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . \nsam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery\'s somber first officer . \nit\'s ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , "" ace of spies . "" \nthe large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . \nthe special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . \nscreenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . \nthey keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . \nthe movie doesn\'t get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . \nthe finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler . \n'",1
"b'in roger michell\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\'s name to the film\'s title . \none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \ni don\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\'s beginning , but there it is . \nif there were ever a clear case for "" less is more , "" this would be it . \nthe film is told nearly first person from william\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \nin fact , much of notting hill\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \nwilliam assures her he wouldn\'t say a word , then adds , "" well , i\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\'d never believe it . "" \ngreat stuff . \nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \nwe\'re constantly exposed to william\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\'re not sure what she\'s been thinking all the times in between . \nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\'s film hands down . \nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\'s unpredictable behavior . \nanna doesn\'t get a lot of our compassion . \nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \nit\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \nroger michell\'s use of visuals doesn\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying "" eight months later , "" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \nwe\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\'s eye view of the ground below . \nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \nit\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \nnotting hill\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\'s not so bad , now is it ? \n'",1
"b'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton\'s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle\'s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who\'s half man or the man who\'s half boy . "" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon\'s mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money\'s worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island\'s dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile\'s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams\'s score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",1
"b'writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s . \nyes , that\'s right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) . \nnow with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing . \nand guess what ?

"b""there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \n , \n""",1
"b""whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days . \nlike the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . \nthe result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message . \nthe message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) . \nbored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate . \nnot part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus . \nyou can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name . \nwhat makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message . \none of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly . \nit'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot . \ndistracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view . \nyou'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens . \nthis film camera is just another one of the guys . \ntiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across . \nbored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares . \ni don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be . \nthat said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted . \nif that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film . \nstay at home and rent up close and personal . \nand what's a buzz without tunes . \nfrom pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film . \ngood and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message . \nevery once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict . \ntrainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations . \ndom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago . \nhe has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago . \nnowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production . \nhe is currently finishing a couple of small projects . \nwith his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations . \n""",1
"b'the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey\'s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . \nin case you\'ve been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . \nhis life seems so perfect , however , because it\'s controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . \nthat\'s right , burbank\'s life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it\'s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \ntalking of carrey , he\'s perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \nhis character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey\'s persona . \nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . \nhe\'s not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . \ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . \nquiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . \nunfortunately , he\'s barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen\'t appear at all ! \nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhone\'s character sylvia . \nshe plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . \nthe supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it\'s creepy . \nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . \npeter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . \nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . \nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . \nsadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . \nalso , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . \nthe screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . \nwhile christoff\'s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . \nalso , there\'s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . \noverall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . \ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . \nit offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes \n'",1
"b'the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo\'s own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . \nthe story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . \nplot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant\'s radical activities . \nhe is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . \nramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this "" assignment "" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) \ncritique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . \nadmittedly , i wasn\'t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn\'t expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . \nthe first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . \nquinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn\'t offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . \nsutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they\'ve played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . \ni didn\'t like performance put forth from quinn\'s wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn\'t show up in most of the film , so that wasn\'t so bad . \ni did however enjoy director duguay\'s interesting style and cinematic vision . \nthis thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . \ni thought that was neat . \nhaving said that , i didn\'t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "" fake "" jackal met with the "" real "" jackal\'s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . \nlittle known facts : ben kingsley\'s real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 "" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982\'s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . \nmany scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo\'s haven of restfulness ) . \ndonald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . \n'",1
"b""hollywood has a . 750 \nbatting average with elmore leonard adaptations . \nlast year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . \nsteven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . \ngeorge clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . \nhe plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . \nnowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . \nclooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . \nclooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . \nin the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . \nof course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . \nit's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . \nclooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . \nmeanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . \nunintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . \nrhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . \nhe's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . \nthe relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . \nthe leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . \nalthough they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . \nout of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . \nthis is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . \nthe entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . \nhere's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . \nserving america for almost 1/20th of a century ! \n""",1
"b'nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) \na film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson \nthis extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker\'s "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . \ninspired by f . w . murnau\'s 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog\'s film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . \nthe original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . \nuntil now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . \nboth of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . \napparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . \nthe german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . \neveryone knows the story of dracula . \nor do they ? \nhis story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won\'t hurt . \njonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker\'s hometown . \nupon seeing a photo of harker\'s wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . \nlocking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . \nupon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . \nthat is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker\'s tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . \nnosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . \nthe film\'s surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . \nthere is much to enjoy , but i\'ll limit my praise to a few key points . \nholding the film together is kinski\'s remarkable performance as count dracula . \npast screen portrayals , including bela lugosi\'s famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . \nbut kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . \naided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula\'s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . \nthis man is dreadfully lonely . \nhe lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . \nkinski\'s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . \nwhen he dies , you almost feel as if this man\'s tortured soul has been freed at last . \nthen there\'s the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . \nit is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it\'s quite impossible to imagine the film without it . \npopul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . \nwhen i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . \nthe one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . \nit\'s a testament to the music\'s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . \nthe album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . \nthis is a timely re-release by anchor bay . \nafter francis ford coppola\'s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker\'s tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog\'s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . \nto some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . \nwithout a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . \ndon\'t miss it . \n'",1
"b'it\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \ni\'d saw that it\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\'m hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train . "" \nyet it\'s almost as good . \nit\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\'t flaunt anything they don\'t want to flaunt , they\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \n "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these . \na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \nbut , as austin powers would say , that\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \nthere\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" \'s "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\'s ever done ) . \nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \nthere\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can\'t do this , can they ? "" \nstreeming through my head . \nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\'s [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \nagain , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\'re not totally laughing at him . \nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \njacob\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\'s ever given and further proof that he\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\'t been in the same year ) because he\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\' amiable town sheriff . \neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \ni won\'t reveal it , but it\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\'t already too much of that anyway . \nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\'s like if in "" crime and punishment "" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\'m at all comparing "" a simple plan "" to dostoevsky . \nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \n'",1
"b'first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don\'t happen to watch it . \nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \nfor us non-fans , there\'s nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \non a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn\'t you know it , he turns out to be right . \nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . \nfive people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . \nthe two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . \ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth . "" \nthe plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired . \ni got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \nit didn\'t . \nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \nit\'s a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high . \nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \nward russell\'s cinematography is very good . \nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film\'s plot . \nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \ni don\'t know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \nthe movie\'s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip \nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . \nin one of the movie\'s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . \nthe visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . \nthere was no question as to who the movie\'s stars would be . \neven so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . \nboth are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . \nthere is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . \nthey are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . \nthere might be some romantic interest , but for now they\'re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . \nno single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . \nbut enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . \n'",1

' \nopening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . \nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . \nhowever , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) \nthey also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) \nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . \nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . \nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . \nthere's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . \nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . \nthere's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . \nthe script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . \nthere's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . \nthe two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . \nqui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . \nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . \nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) \nanakin is annoying and unlikeable . , \ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . \nit's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . \nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . \nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . \nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . \nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . \nagain , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . \nthe actors don't help the movie much either . \nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . \nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . \nthe casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . \nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . \nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . \nthere's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . \nhe's not even very 'cute . ' \nthe main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . \nthere's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . \nthe cgi takes away much of the human element , however . \nthe battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . \nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit's got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . \ndisappointing is barely the word . \nrating= \n""",0
"b'the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid\'s point of view is , in a word , "" dark "" . \nyou wouldn\'t expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson\'s novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal . \njekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate . \nmary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times . \ndirector stephen fears\' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them . \nthe lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white . \nthe direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid . \nscenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry . \n ( except there\'s no red , of course . ) \nthe look is so moody and melodramatic that you\'ll be shocked when you leave the theater . \ni saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward . \noften the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts . \nhere the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless . \nhis alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience . \ntwo parts that make up a whole . \nneither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable . \nthe differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude . \nwhen we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands . \nroberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles . \nboth are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film . \nthe only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents . \nlife and color maybe , but this is not close\'s best role . \nshe seems little more than a cardboard cutout character . \na beautiful film in its own dreary way . \nyou\'ll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don\'t expect to leave in an upbeat mood . \n'",1
"b'forget get carter . \ninstead . . . \nget me a cup of coffee . \nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? \ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980\'s -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don\'t mean new york city . \nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80\'s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \nget carter is a simple story . \nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \nwhen frank\'s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter\'s way "" . \nhe talks tough with his brother\'s wife , lends a helping had to his brother\'s daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \nwhat a minute ! \nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \n'",0

"b'hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\'s rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai\'s boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit\'s not until club owner silk (

guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\'s death . \n "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather "" . \nthe relationship between jet li\'s han and aaliyah\'s trish o\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\'s "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o\'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\'s son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet\'s u . s . debut ) didn\'t allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\'s "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n\'rmd\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\'s films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx "" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\'t let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in \'romeo must die\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like "" the replacement killer "" and , currently "" romeo

"b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \nit\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \njim carrey\'s signed on too ? \neven better . \nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth . \nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\'t funny . \nit\'s not for lack of trying . \nthe farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \nsoon enough , charlie\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \nthis guy isn\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \nsome have suggested that this isn\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\' brand of humor doesn\'t require plot to work . \nthey\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\' last effort , 1996\'s "" there\'s something about mary . "" \n ( 1999\'s "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . ) \nthe brothers\' earlier film wasn\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \nin "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \n "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \nhaving been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \nbut they haven\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \nyeah , me too . ) \nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \nbut by the end of the film , they\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\'t been dropped either . \nthat\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \n "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities . \nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\'s actions . \nthis doesn\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\'s condition early on , so they don\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" \nit\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \ncarrey doesn\'t pull any stunts we don\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\' script doesn\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\'t set up in any meaningful way . \nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \nzellweger\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film . \nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \nafter viewing the shapeless mess that "" me , myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \nbut i don\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\'ll rebound just fine . \neven after that happens , though , i\'ll still consider "" me , myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire . \n'",0
"b'if there\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\'s major studios , it\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\'s obvious there\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . "" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\'s envy . \nfor daniels , it\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\'t . \n'",1

"b'it\'s terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\'s unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office . \nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama . \nadditionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \nand where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary . \ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \nfinally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? "" \napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike "" the sixth sense , "" this young child isn\'t the focus of the picture . \ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \nshe didn\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \n "" stir of echoes "" isn\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\'s "" dream with the fishes "" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "" sleep . "" \nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\'s "" to die for , "" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , "" i wouldn\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\'s dead gives one pause . "" \nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\'s "" intersection "" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\'s "" whatever , "" as morrison\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \nif the resolution of "" stir of echoes "" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \n "" stir of echoes "" isn\'t as good as "" the sixth sense , "" but why should it need to be ? \nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and "" stir of echoes "" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \n'",1

"b'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \n ( note that , in the 1970\'s , we really didn\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \nwhitaker\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\'s "" counselor cleavage .

"b'it\'s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director\'s cut of the film . \nfilms such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker\'s integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . \nthe advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . \nthe dvd release of the original international version of luc besson\'s 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director\'s cut . \nfor years , i have heard of an "" international "" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . \ni even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors\' cuts - including l ? on . \nbut after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . \nuntil now . \nthe film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . \nhe lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . \none day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . \ntaking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . \nmathilda learns of l ? on\'s hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on\'s footsteps as a "" cleaner . "" \nshe then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . \nat this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . \nthe international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed "" too explicit . "" \ni assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . \nthe best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda\'s and l ? on\'s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . \nthere\'s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson\'s la femme nikita , and killing zoe . \nwith these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda\'s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . \nthe most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . \nthe film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . \nmy advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . \ndirector/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello \n'",1

"b""so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . \nthe first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . \nnow comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . \nthe classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . \nif they survive the night they get the money . \nif not well you get the jurisdiction . \nhaving not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . \nbut sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . \ngeoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . \nhis wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . \nsteven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . \nsomehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . \neddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . \nwhat he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . \nif they can they get the money , if not well they don't . \nthe house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . \nyears before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . \neveryone who was in there burned to death . \nnow it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . \nwhat starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . \nthe deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . \none-by-one the people start to disappear . \nconspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . \nthe people find rooms , which once held mental patients . \nrooms which once had people dying . \nrooms which may still contain these people . \nnow these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . \nsince i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . \ni can say however i liked this movie . \ngeoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . \nfamke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . \nali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . \nchris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . \npeter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . \nthe plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . \nthe movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . \ni found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . \none thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . \neven though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . \nthe movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . \nthe ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . \ni must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . \ni was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . \ninstead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . \nhouse on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . \nthough it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . \nbut besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time ! \n""",1
"b'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters . \nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \nput simply , brooks\' comedy is intelligent . \nmother is albert brooks\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\'s life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do . "" \nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \nit\'s the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . "" \nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \nthere\'s always the big but . \njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \n "" a great experiment "" , he calls it . \nbrooks\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \nthere\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don\'t want to stay at a hotel . "" \nshe still doesn\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \n "" you\'ve named the ice ? "" \nasks john . \nhe\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \n "" the freezer was a good invention , "" says john , "" but it\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \nthat\'s why it\'s smaller than the refrigerator . "" \nit\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \nwhen they\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! "" \nyou don\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \ni don\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \njohn\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \nin a way , he\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\'s hard to get mad at her character . \nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\'s disease . \nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\'s boy . \nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \na solid connection is not really made between john\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \nbeatrice : you must think i\'m some kind of moron . \njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\'m a moron . \nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \n'",1
"b""billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . \njacob and lou want to pocket the cash . \nhank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . \neventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . \nthings start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \ndisaster is sure to strike . \ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \nscott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \nalar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \nif there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long . \njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \nwhile this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife . \nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \n""",1
"b'as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year\'s dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . \nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn\'t mainstream and it\'s been retread to death . \nsecond , the sex is just bad . \ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there\'s nothing even remotely tantalizing . \nthe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . \ncultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes\' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he\'s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv\'s core audience is the high school demographic . \nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv\'s "" dawson\'s creek , "" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \nthere\'s not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there\'s not much to like about it , either . \neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn\'t , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . \nthis is certainly missable . \n'",0

"b'surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless\'s brittany murphy , don\'t say a word looked full of promise . \nhell , when i hear that "" i\'ll never tell "" whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine . \nalas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller . \ndouglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) . \nafter a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean\'s koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago . \nbut with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth\'s head in order to get the goods inside . \nthe catch - nathan only has until five o\'clock to solve the puzzle ! \nwhoa , the suspense is almost too much . \ndon\'t say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . \nmurphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . \nand the only real "" crazy "" to be found in the film is director gary fleder\'s ( things to do in denver when you\'re dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . \noliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . \nadditionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan\'s every move is downright unbelievable . \nhow do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? \ndespite its flaws , don\'t say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you\'ll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . \namericans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . \nsomeone get me my lithium ! \n'",0
"b""and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \n""",0
"b'here\'s something to chew on : what\'s the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? \nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that\'s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . \ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . \nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . \nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . \nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . \nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . \ni suppose deep rising\'s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn\'t do much for me . \non the surface , and that\'s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . \nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . \nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . \nin fact , it\'s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron\'s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . \nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? \nprobably not , since it\'s easy to guess , but i\'ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . \nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . \nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there\'s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat\'s pilot , who\'s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o\'connor ) , the inept sidekick who\'s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . \ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . \nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . \naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there\'s no one on board . \nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . \nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad\'s cinque ) . \nwilliams , once a "" can\'t miss "" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . \nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . \ngiven her limited acting abilities , it\'s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . \nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . \nmeanwhile , kevin j . o\'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . \nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . \nthis is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . \nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . \nnow , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it\'s impossible to tell where they end and where "" reality "" begins . \nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . \nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn\'t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . \neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won\'t be the last of its kind . \nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . \nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \n'",0
"b'saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn\'t too impressed . \nthis film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . \nsound cliche ? \nthat\'s only the beginning . \nbilly zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character . \nhe was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him . \nthen he goes "" crazy "" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . \ni\'m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . \nbut it didn\'t all come together . \ni think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . \nbut once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn\'t react too logically to many of the situations . \nthere was very little logical development in these characters . \nmy biggest problem with this film was it\'s tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . \nthey began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . \nand of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . \nnow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that\'s what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . \nso some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn\'t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the "" real life "" feel of covert operations in panama . \na word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . \nthe jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . \nand the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . \nmany have seen the slowed down "" bullet-cam "" following the projectile to its target . \nthis was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . \nit was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but \nit seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then \nit just seemed silly . \nall in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . \nbut the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn\'t form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics . \n'",0
"b'well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . \nhe has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . \nin a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . \neraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . \nbatman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . \nnow in 1999 , "" end of days "" ( not "" the end of days "" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . \nis this the end of a powerful action star\'s long-lived career ? \nwill arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( "" terminator "" , "" terminator 2 : judgement day "" , "" predator "" ) ? \nor an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( "" commando "" , "" red sonja "" , "" true lies "" ) ? \nit doesn\'t look that way . \n "" end of days "" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan\'s baby the hour before new year\'s of 2000 . \nfortunately for the movie\'s sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . \nit\'s an action film\'s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . \nimagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . \narnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . \nif the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . \njericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . \njericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name . \narnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . \nhe shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . \nin one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; "" you are a @#$^% ! & \nchoir boy ! \nyou are a choir boy !

"b'synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn\'t look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . \nafter a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . \ncomments : "" alan smithee "" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled "" fatal bore "" or "" fatal crap "" . \nif you find out that a film you\'re about to see is directed by "" alan smithee , "" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . \n "" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . \nfrankly , i\'d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the "" alan smithee "" moniker for this film . \nwhere to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? \nlet\'s start with the acting . \nit\'s pretty bad . \namanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don\'t ) , even though her performance isn\'t exactly stellar material . \nshe\'s also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . \nher scenes with valerie\'s mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . \nthe two look as though they\'re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn\'t understand . \nchristopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . \ntrying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . \nif disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn\'t cut it here . \nearly on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . \noutside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . \nthey constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . \nfatal charm\'s storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . \nthe script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . \nthis suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . \neven for the idiots who didn\'t consider the movie\'s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . \nso , the audience must wait ( if they haven\'t already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . \nthe video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an "" erotic thriller "" . \na thriller it isn\'t , and neither is it particularly erotic . \ni can\'t imagine , if someone were in the mood for something "" erotic , "" that he\'d be happy after watching this fluff . \na few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they\'re supposed to be valerie\'s fantasies -- how creative ) . \non a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . \nit\'s no wonder why she hated high school so much . \nas an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student\'s bad poetry ( of course , it\'s valerie\'s ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem\'s inspiration . \ni guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . \nfatal charm won\'t charm anyone , unless there\'s someone that\'s charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . \nif you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on . \n'",0

"b' "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" \n--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . \nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . \nin the early 70\'s , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o\'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . \nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . \nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . \nthe film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \nand immediately tanked at the box office . \nwhether it was because fox wasn\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\'s mad schemes . \nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \nit goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film . \neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \nwhat those who haven\'t seen the movie don\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \nmy personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy . \ntim curry\'s vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed . \nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don\'t dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i\'m going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \nthe film\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \no\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \nif you are one of those people who can\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes "" . \nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\'s story lab . \nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the "" behind the music : rocky horror "" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung "" hot patootie "" . \nthe "" behind the music "" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\'brien\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \none of which is just the "" superheroes "" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called "" once in a while "" . \na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\'s pants ) . \nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is "" a different sort of jaws "" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for "" toucha toucha touch me "" and "" sweet transvestite "" ) . \nfox\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( "" you\'re lucky . . . \ni\'m lucky . . . \nhe\'s lucky . . . \nwe\'re all lucky ! "" ) . \nit\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . \ni raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition . \n[r] \n'",1
"b""to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . \ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . \never since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . \nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . \nfrank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) . \nfrank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance . \nthe first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain . \nthe second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . \nand finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . \ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \ndoes `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? \nonly occasionally . \nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . \nthose expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . \n`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . \nschrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . \nthe exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . \ngoodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . \nwatch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . \n`bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . \nscorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . \n""",1
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \namong my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there\'s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky\'s darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . \n ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) \nwhile i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn\'t comment with any authority , it\'s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would\'ve already figured it all out ) . \nthe difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character\'s psychosis . \nit\'s also vastly more convincing with its argument . \n "" mathematics is the language of the universe , "" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture . \nsince nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i\'m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . \nobsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . \nsullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . \nthe story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it\'s a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one\'s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max\'s all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . \nit helps matters that he\'s not a particularly likable protagonist . \nall attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn\'t the time to indulge in pleasantries . \nfor a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we\'re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we\'re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it\'s more disturbing journey than quest . \nstill , we do care about max\'s fate . \nteetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . \nas we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show\'s laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it\'s always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . \npi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . \nthe repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max\'s claustrophobic perspective . \nin this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky\'s striking direction . \nit\'s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist\'s warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . \n ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) \nusing savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max\'s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . \npi\'s raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch\'s early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . \nthe film\'s sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . \nstill , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . \nat one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . . \ncomputer chip . \n "" isn\'t it beautiful , "" she coos . \na showcase for mr . aronofsky\'s technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it\'s since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell\'s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn\'s attention . \ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \nmcfarlane\'s "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \nthe early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \nwith the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros . \'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \nwhat happened ? \nwhy is spawn so bad ? \ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \ni don\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \nspawn\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \nmcfarlane\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \nmore time needed to be spent on white\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \nsheen\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that "" how much of [spawn\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , "" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\'s "" long hard road out of hell "" effectively compliments spawn\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\'s "" ( can\'t you ) trip like i do "" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \nfor as good a comic book as it is , "" spawn "" did not spawn a good movie . \nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\'t be appropriate for the very young . \n'",0

"b'you know something , christmas is not about presents . \nit\'s about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . \nat least that would seem to be the message of "" the grinch , "" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . \nhollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . \nyou know the plot : there\'s this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . \ndown below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . \nthe movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children\'s book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . \nit\'s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that\'s the case when jones\' version is compared to ron howard\'s . \nthe tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff\'s soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing "" mr . grinch "" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch\'s wide , toothless grin . \nby contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . \nfirst , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . \nyoung wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . \nshe begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . \ncindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . \nare we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? \nthe grinch isn\'t even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch\'s rival for martha\'s affection . \nnot only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . \nthe casting choices aren\'t any better than the screenwriting decisions . \njim carrey seems woefully miscast . \nwhile his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . \nhis accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from "" south park . "" \nnot knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch\'s home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . \nneedless to say , his wise-cracking antics don\'t quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . \nlittle taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . \nshe would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding "" santa "" in her living room stealing the tree ) . \nhowever , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . \nbottom line : when you\'re stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . \n'",0

"b'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \nit is the latest entry in this decade\'s dubious revival of the \'70s disaster film , and the first of two "" the sky is falling "" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \nits tagline , "" oceans rise . \ncities fall . \nhope survives "" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( "" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \nis together "" ) , but it\'s every bit as treacly . \nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening "" roll call , "" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \nthe most prominent of the "" personal "" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\'s ostensible main character . \nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\'s peak , but there\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \nhaving passed the "" er challenge "" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \nthere\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon "" fish "" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\'t as deep as hoped . \n'",1
"b'confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind . \ni don\'t know why , really . \nhaven\'t wanted to check it out on video , haven\'t been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen . \nso right up front , i\'ll admit that i don\'t know what the heck i\'m talking about , but here goes . . . \nis titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990\'s ? \nmaybe that\'s going a little bit too far . \nas good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they\'re no clark gable and vivien leigh . \nbut . . . \nthe parallels are there . \ngwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor . \ntitanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . \ngwtw places america\'s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic\'s most legendary tragedy . \nthey both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . \nok , maybe that\'s not enough parallels . \nso titanic\'s not in gwtw\'s league . \nno matter . \ntitanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . \nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . \nthe money was obviously well-spent . \nthe costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . \ni especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . \nbut writer/director/producer james cameron\'s real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn\'t just costuming and set design and special effects . \ncameron\'s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . \nhe succeeds masterfully . \ncameron does two things that work incredibly well . \nfirst , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that\'s just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you ) . \nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . \ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . \nstuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . \nsecondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . \nthe way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . \ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . \nthe supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there\'s no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what\'s he been in . \n ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . ) \nthe love story itself is rather conventional . \ni think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . \nthe performances are the key here . \nzane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . \nhe\'s smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he\'s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible . \nat the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not "" can i save this little girl ? "" , \nbut "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? "" \ndicaprio is a revelation . \ni hadn\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\'s hard not to like him . \nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \nwinslet\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \nat first , she\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \nwe know from the narration that she\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \nit\'s at that moment where winslet\'s character really comes alive . \nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \ncameron\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \n'",1
"b' "" with all that education , you should know what happiness is . "" \nstarring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung \nevery country has , eventually , its new wave . \nfrance had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on . \nsome waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery . \ntaiwan\'s new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang\'s first feature--is central . \nit created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering . \nlater works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence . \nthat day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation\'s attempt to find a voice . \nit does not lack ambition . \nit anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling . \njia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents . \nno one is happy . \njia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age . \nat the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li\'s marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other . \nbut it goes wrong . \nthat day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . \nthe film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\'t . \nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \nthe film\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \nindeed , it\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\'s mistress--but they are brief . \ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\'s leading cinematographers . \nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\'s inexperience or yang\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \n'",0
"b'the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies . \nconsider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . \ntop-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . \nbased on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story\'s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . \ntold in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan\'s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . \nthe author is even on record as applauding egoyan\'s changes . \nin the press notes the book\'s author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children . "" \nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \nthey and the rest of the town\'s children come into harm\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \neach little aspect has its own fascination . \nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\'s numerous faults . \nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \nwell , single parent billy\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \n ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \n "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back . \nmitchell\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \nmychael danna\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \n'",1

"b'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \n "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine "" . \nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \ncomparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable . \nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \n "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider\'s story . \nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser . \nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\'s life isn\'t even mentioned here . \nglossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack . \nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( "" goodfellas "" , "" taxi driver "" , "" casino "" ) has shifted gears . \nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his "" the last temptation of christ "" , this is his slowest film yet . \noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \nphilip glass\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\'t many of these . \neven with its problems , the "" kundun "" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \nmany people who saw "" seven years in tibet "" will have a "" been there , done that "" attitude . \nit\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \n'",1

"" \ni am only vaguely aware of the show\'s premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube . \n "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre . \nneve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show . \nso too is jennifer love hewitt . \nlo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line . \nthough the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater\'s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout . \njennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting . \nshe just isn\'t convincing in this film ( and she wasn\'t in the original either ) . \nthis puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she\'s very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure . \nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience . \ni\'ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason . \ni still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses . \nnothing else here is original or interesting . \nthis movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter\'s vampires seem like stunning works of high art . \ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture . \nthe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer\'s hook . \nthey may as well have huge targets painted on them . \nlike scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief . \nunfortunately , i still know\'s characters aren\'t all that funny . \nin particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn\'t die soon enough . \nthe death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film . \nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie . \nthis , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for . \nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ? \ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . \ncome on , the guy looks like the gorton\'s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . \nthough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that\'s * really * saying something . \nso , all that\'s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . \nboth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . \nhewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . \n . \n . titillating . \nthis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . \notherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . \nearly in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . \nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . \ni needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . \noh , and the film\'s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! \npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know\'s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . \nboring ! \ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . \nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . \nit\'s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don\'t seem to mind participating in a mass "" mystery science theater 3000 "" -type viewing . \ni still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . \nif it weren\'t for the main actresses\' revealing wardrobes , i\'d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . \ni can\'t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn\'t recommend it to people , unless they\'re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . \ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . \nwhat a depressing thought . \nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . \nrated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . \ni\'d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn\'t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film\'s target audience . \n'",0

"b""damn those trailers . \nhad it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . \nas it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . \nmarie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . \nshe takes a nap while he goes for a swim . \nwhen marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . \nshe contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . \ndid he disappear to start a new life ? \nwas he killed by accident ? \ndid he commit suicide ? \nmarie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . \nit's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . \nthe film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . \nit's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . \nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . \nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . \nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . \nshe can't quite get over him . \nthey've been married for twenty-five years . \nthe other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . \nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . \nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . \nwhile it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . \nozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer . \n""",1
"b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\'s schindler\'s list shows . \nmost of today\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . "" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\'s doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\'s charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\'s mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe\'s definitely a driving force in homer\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n'",1

"" \nstylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn\'t use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . \nat the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . \nprogressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom . \n "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself . \nonce seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . \narguing in the airport lobby , alex\'s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . \nas two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . \ncarter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . \nalex\'s best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can\'t because of his fearful parents . \nthe teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . \nonly outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex\'s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . \nthat is only the setup of "" final destination , "" and the less said about what follows , the better . \nsuffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . \nthe setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and "" final destination "" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . \ngraphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don\'t know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . \ndevon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999\'s underseen slasher-comedy , "" idle hands , "" is even more of a charismatic presence here . \nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn\'t meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . \none scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . \nali larter ( 1999\'s "" varsity blues "" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . \nthe other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . \nthe movie is mainly sawa\'s , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . \ntony todd ( 1992\'s "" candyman "" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . \nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . \nultimately , what is so good about "" final destination "" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today\'s horror films . \nif anything , it\'s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again . \n'",1
"b'i\'m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream . "" \nmaybe it\'s because they\'re both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me . \nbut this is not the next in line with the "" scream "" flicks as well as the "" i know what you did last summer "" soon to be flicks . \nit owes less to "" halloween "" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . \nand it should have been . \nthis is basically a rehash of "" the stepford wives , "" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i\'ve been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives . \nor something like that . \n "" behavior , "" starring katie holmes of "" dawson\'s creek , "" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers . \nsuck-ups . \npreppies . \nit actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like "" beautiful girls "" and "" things to do in denver when you\'re dead "" ( as well as "" con air "" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit . \nalas , it\'s not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as "" the movies with potential that blow it . "" \ni remember a film called "" white man\'s burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it\'s potentially brilliant premise . \nhere\'s another one . \nit could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves . \nit\'s a stage , and this film does in fact realize that . \nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly . \nnow it just needs to work as a film . \nwhich it doesn\'t . \nit\'s too sloppy and too contrived . \nit paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then \nlets it lie . \nit brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then \ngives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal . \nisn\'t it scary enough that they\'re like this , and can\'t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? \nthe film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they\'re not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who\'s having trouble at home because he hasn\'t gotten over his brother\'s ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don\'t recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from "" dawson\'s creek "" ) , who\'s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from "" the man without a face "" ) , who\'s the most interesting because he\'s the only character who\'s given some dimension . \nin the film\'s best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one\'s fetishes and hang-ups , and it\'s the best scene in the movie because it\'s witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn\'t . \ngavin suspects there\'s something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he\'s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . \nhere , we have another case of "" the idiot plot , "" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . \nthe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but \nreally , we don\'t care anyway . \ni probably shouldn\'t mention that this was directed by david nutter , who\'s works for "" the x-files , "" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . \nlike the show , he\'s good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . \nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . \nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . \nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don\'t get the hell out of there . \ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there\'s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . \nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . \nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . \nif he\'s so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn\'t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? \nthe film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . \nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it\'s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one\'s mouth , especially mine . \n'",0
"b""plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . \nnaturally , this got me worried . \nwould jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? \nif it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . \nif it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . \nunfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . \ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . \nas the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . \nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) \nhot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . \nplunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . \nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . \ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . \nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . \nthe five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . \nalso , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . \nthe story is a bit of a mess , frankly . \nthe performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . \nher irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . \nshe looks nice , though . \nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . \nken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . \ni didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . \nalthough a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . \nbut production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . \njake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . \nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . \nplunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . \nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel . \nthere's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . \nalthough it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . \nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . \ngive it a miss . \n""",0
"b'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the "" meet cute . "" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n'",0

"b'more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \nduring the 1950\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \n "" ben-hur . "" \n "" cleopatra . "" \n "" the robe . "" \n "" sparticus . "" \n "" the fall of the roman empire . "" \n "" quo vadis . "" \nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\'s ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" ) . \nyet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now . \n "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\' place is never explained . ) \nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\' wounds . \nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \nthe similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \nalso , like mel gibson\'s epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\'s anger . \nit\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \n "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? ) . \nthere\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\'s love or pride . \nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \ni\'ve been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper . "" \nthis role doesn\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l . \na . confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \nmy only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look . \nseveral scenes are tinted . \nwe\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix . "" \ni don\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \nin "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\'etre of the roman epic . \n ( perhaps it\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \nwith a more realistic look , "" gladiator "" could be even more satisfying than "" braveheart "" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \n'",1
"b'the yet-to-be-released krippendorf\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . \nthis movie can\'t make up its mind . \nis it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? \nor is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? \neither way , "" unbalanced "" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . \nthe premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years "" getting over "" the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . \nnow it\'s time to show what he\'s achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . \nwith a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald\'s . \nbut when his "" discovery "" becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . \nwith the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the "" shelmikedmu "" tribe ( named from the first half of each child\'s name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf\'s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . \ndespite the professor\'s wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf\'s main assistant . \nhungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . \nkrippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . \non the opposing end is krippendorf\'s arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . \nit\'s a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf\'s tribe could\'ve been a real winner . \nsadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a "" family comedy "" ) just aren\'t the right tone for this film . \ncut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you\'ve got a good start . \nat the state it\'s in now , you\'ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . \ndoubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that\'s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . \nthe overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of "" average "" , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . \nmost of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . \ndirector todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . \nit\'s stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . \nit\'s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it\'s a brutal drop . \na strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she\'s holding his penis ? \nyes , it\'s put that bluntly ! \njust be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame . \n'",0
"b'bill condon\'s "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics "" frankenstein "" and "" bride of frankenstein . "" \nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man . "" \nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \nclayon agrees , and doesn\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \n "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a "" motion picture director , "" rather than a "" horror director . "" \nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \nit is evident that whale\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the "" on-again-off-again "" friendship at the film\'s center is fairly predictable . \nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \n "" gods and monsters "" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \nwalking away from "" gods and monsters , "" it was ian mckellen\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \nit is a sad testament when a person\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\'s business in the first place . \n'",1
"b'in my review of "" the spy who shagged me , "" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \n "" scream 3 "" provides the latest proof of this rule . \nin los angeles production has begun on "" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , "" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and "" stab "" cast members turn up stabbed . \nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3 .

"b""when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . \nhowever , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . \nhowever , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . \nhowever , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . \nso , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . \nin the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . \nalthough it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . \nnobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . \nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . \nhowever , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day . \n""",0
"b'when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . \nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out . \nmuch like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever . \nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact . \n "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making . \nit has altered the way films will be viewed . \n "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i\'ve lost count . \nsure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s . \nin this review , i hope to change all the people\'s minds who have criticized it for it\'s excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn\'t really that graphic ) . \nthe most brilliant aspect of tarantino\'s masterpiece is the screenplay . \nit is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn\'t already . \nthe story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . \nthe first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace\'s wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim\'s . \nthey talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . \nafter giving marcellus\' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment "" . \nthey also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell "" . \ni won\'t reveal the rest of the story , but i\'ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . \nthe second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . \npreviously in the film ( like i said , it\'s told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . \nas it turns out , he not only doesn\'t take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . \nhe takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend\'s apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . \non his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . \nthe two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig ! "" \nscene from "" deliverance "" . \nthe last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . \nthey seek help with a friend of jackson\'s ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . \nthey end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . \nin the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . \nif you haven\'t already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . \nit features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . \nearlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . \nwhat the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . \nthat version cut out , like , half the movie . \nwhat i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . \nfor instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . \nthis might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . \njust a theory . . . \none of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . \n "" psycho "" "" kiss me deadly "" , "" deliverance "" , etc . ) . \nbut why shouldn\'t he ? \nit\'s not like he out-right and blatantly stole . \ngive the guy a break . \nin case you haven\'t already noticed , i believe "" pulp fiction "" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as "" casablanca "" and "" the godfather "" ) . \ntrust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . \nand besides , it\'s one hell of a ride . \nnote : if anyone knows how i could get a "" bad motherfucker "" wallet , please e-mail me . \nany help would be greatly appreciated . \n'",1

"b'adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . \nunfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . \nhe\'s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . \nhe\'s certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . \nthe year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . \nadam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . \nrobbie\'s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . \nhowever , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . \nshe\'s the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she\'s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . \nso , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . \nas far as plots go , it\'s a pretty thin and tired one . \nto fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . \nfrom boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik\'s cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . \nand then there\'s the music . . . \nlearning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele\'s high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . \nas a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives\' eyes : the wedding singer vols . \n2 , 3 , and 4 ! \nwhile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . \nat least last year\'s my best friend\'s wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person . \nhere , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . \nbarrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . \nwhich leaves us with adam sandler . \nhe\'s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . \nwhen he\'s in full nice-guy mode , he\'s more pathetic than endearing . \nthe film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . \nbut none of them work well at all . \nbuscemi\'s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . \nlovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . \nthe only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film\'s finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) \nadam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . \nwhile he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . \n'",0
"b'slavery is bad . \nafter hundreds of years , we\'ve finally figured that one out . \nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\'s latest "" serious "" film . \nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners . \nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \ntheir masters ? \nthe spanish government ? \nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \nthe us government ? \nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \neven that doesn\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\'s for spielberg . \nmuch like his "" shindler\'s list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \nit\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \nwithout that question to ponder , the director\'s job is more difficult . \nhe has to make the story interesting . \nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \ntappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans . \nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \nthe rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \nthe film\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \nthe former model\'s first major role is a winner . \nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) . \nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \nthere are some other great moments . \nespecially impressive are the african\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \n'",1
"b'after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don\'t think any of the romances i\'ve seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\'s direction . \nfrom the very first bird\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the "" return to me "" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\'re in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don\'t act that way ; real people aren\'t that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\'s wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n "" return to me "" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of "" the x-files .

"b'i\'ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . \nthe part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . \nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . \nhe\'s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . \nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . \nthe dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . \nthe millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . \nhe wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . \ndude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . \ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . \nit is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . \nnot only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . \nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . \neach person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . \nthe characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . \nit\'s not what they do that\'s funny , it\'s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . \nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that\'s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who\'s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . \naside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . \npeople lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . \nthey sound natural . \ntaken with fargo , the coen brothers\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . \nethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he\'s also good at technical directing . \nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . \nperhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . \nbut the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . \nall around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . \noutstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . \n'",1
"b' "" sometimes the \'green mile\' seems sooooo long . "" \nindeed . \nand any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . \non a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . \nthe mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to "" old sparky , "" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana\'s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . \npaul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you\'ve got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row . \nkeeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . \nit is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they "" talk to "" the convicts instead of yelling at them . \nthis practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . \ninto his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . \nimmediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . \nperhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . \nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he "" takes back "" paul\'s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . \nbased on steven king\'s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner "" fry "" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he\'s witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . \nwhile it is mr . hanks "" everyman "" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . \nall involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . \nif only the story were more credible . \nwriter/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . \nmr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . \nwas it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? \nby not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts\' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . \nthis is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . \nmuch has also been made of coffey\'s christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey\'s powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like "" i feel your pain "" transference . \nin contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . \nthe genuine "" gifts of healing "" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . \ntrue spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . \nsuch believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god . \n'",1

"b'the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . \none was _gattaca_ . \nthe other was _the thirteenth floor_ . \njust as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . \nhowever , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . \na cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . \nhis associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . \nalong the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . \n_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . \nthe result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . \nfirst , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . \nsecond and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . \nno wonder it fell through the cracks . \ndone in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . \nmany audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . \ni recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . \ndespite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . \nin that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . \nthe moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . \nin its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane\'s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . \nalthough there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . \nin fact , hannon fuller\'s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane\'s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . \nthis is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . \nthe tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . \nthe major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . \nbierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . \nd\'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . \nthe lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . \nher voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . \nthis could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . \nsome minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . \nthere are one or two instances of jerky editing . \nthe script takes the edge off the film\'s climaxes . \nthe atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . \none wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . \none can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : "" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy .

"b'i\'ve noticed something lately that i\'ve never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni\'m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we\'re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient\'s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth\'s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it\'s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit\'s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren\'t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it\'s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit\'s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn\'t know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n'",1

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nthe teaser trailers for my best friend\'s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \nthe heroine of my best friend\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\'s age , julianne realizes that he\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \nthe setup for my best friend\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \nfor example , there\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \nmy best friend\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\'s everyone says i love you ; i\'d even assert it\'s a more successful one . \nmy best friend\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\'s life , she\'d actually like her too . \nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \nmy best friend\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \nthis isn\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\'s weddding . \nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \nshe even sings - i won\'t soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don\'t know what to do with myself "" . \nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \nwhen julia roberts\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america\'s sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \nwhile that didn\'t quite work out , it\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \nmy best friend\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \n'",1
"b'when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people\'s first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . \nmoreau ) , but he was dreamworks\'s choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . \nthe selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn\'t in the casting department . \nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . \nin the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . \nanimated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . \nlet me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . \ndreamworks\'s antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . \nthe prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . \nlike antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar\'s a bug\'s life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . \ndanny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . \nyou can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . \nthe movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff\'s notes version of demille\'s the ten commandments . \nthe script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses\'s life . \ndemille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . \nat less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn\'t establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . \nwe meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . \nwe watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . \nmoses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . \n ( "" all i\'ve ever known to be true is a lie , "" moses complains . ) \nafter finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . \nafter leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses\'s people go . \nthis leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . \nit is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . \ndrawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . \nthe construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . \nthe most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . \ndone with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . \neven though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . \nthis awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . \nthe prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . \nit is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . \nhow old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it . \n'",1
"b"">from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . \ninstead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . \nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian . \nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . \nthe movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . \nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . \nfollowing one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . \nit's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . \nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . \nwithout giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . \nand it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . \na grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . \ndrawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . \n""",1
"b'plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . \nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . \noh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? \nkewl ! \ncritique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . \nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . \ni mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! \ni also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . \ni especially enjoyed bonham carter\'s performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth\'s bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . \nplot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . \ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . \ni also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn\'t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won\'t ruin it here but c\'mon guys . . . you \ncoulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . \nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . \nthis dude didn\'t seem to give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn\'t really care about what happened to him either . \nnow i\'m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . \nvisually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . \nthe "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn\'t really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . \nso overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn\'t appreciate the film\'s lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . \nbut i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . \nps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn\'t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he\'s suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house !

"b'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \nit\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\' 1988 film wings of desire . \ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\'t a rip-off of its source material . \nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \nthat\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . "" \n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \nsince i love this film so much , i\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\'t perfect . \nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \nhe\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \nhe\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n'",1
"b'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \nand if there wasn\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \n ( a heist comedy ? \nyup . \ndeniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \nwag the dog succeeds because it\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \nok , maybe it\'s not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless . \n ( any average person who thinks that they\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \nand because we\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \ninstead , david mamet\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \nit\'s all : "" what do i love ? \nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \nbaseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \nit\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\'s so excited that he can\'t even shut up . \neven on the edge of disaster , he\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \ninsiders note that he\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\'t . \nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the "" fad king "" , who handles the profitable "" back-end "" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\'d go see it . \nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious "" ballad of the green berets "" parody . \nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated "" hero "" of the albanian conflict . \ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\'t . \n'",1
"b'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \nthat day doesn\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \noscar and lucinda isn\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \non more than one occasion , it\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\'t go anywhere . \nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \nthematically , the film is also strong . \nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \noscar and lucinda don\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \nthere\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \n'",1
"b'underwater science fiction stays submerged \nsphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . \nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . \npsychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . \nwhen he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . \nhaving written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . \nhis group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . \nunfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . \n "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" \nlead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . \nonce there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo . \ndiscovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . \nwhen adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . \na storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . \n "" my name is jerry . \ni am happy "" flashes across the screen . \nthis is unsettling for the psychologist . \n "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks . \nbarnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can\'t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . \nthen the situation turns bad . \ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere . \na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . \nlethal sea snakes attack goodman . \na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" . \nthe suspicious scientists turn against each other . \nthis has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man\'s science fiction film . \nhowever even the finest ingredients don\'t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn\'t seem to care about his product . \ndirector barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn\'t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . \nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . \nit\'s much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . \nit doesn\'t get any better when the action scenes begin . \nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . \noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . \nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . \ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . \neven goodman and halperin\'s ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . \nher psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . \nthere\'s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . \nwhen an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what\'s going to happen . \nthe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . \nchapter headings that divide the movie have no function . \nthe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . \nmuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . \nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn\'t . \neven a science fiction film must be internally consistent . \nthere\'s too much here that doesn\'t make sense . \nare the manifestations real ? \nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . \na scene in the sub suggests that it\'s illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it\'s not . \nnot everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . \nwhere the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . \neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . \nthe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . \nafter pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . \nit\'s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . \nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . \nthe weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn\'t have been much left . \nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there\'s nothing special on the screen . \nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . \nstealing from "" alien "" , "" the abyss "" and the disastrous "" event horizon "" , this film has learned nothing from them . \nremarkably levinson and hoffman\'s other currently showing film is "" wag the dog "" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . \nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word . \n'",0
"b'after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . \nthis is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . \nin fact it\'s not even a comedy . \nit\'s a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . \nbased on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity\'\' is a wry and likable story about a man\'s quest for fulfillment and happiness . \nrob gordon was a dj . \nit seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . \nnow he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . \nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . \ndecimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what\'s right and what\'s important . \nhe starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists "" . \nand the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . \nthough you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn\'t seem that way and all rob\'s relationships were different versions of that first . \nwhere did he go wrong ? \nwas it he that screwed up ? \nor maybe life just stinks ? \nwhile he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . \nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . \nalthough a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . \nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . \nhe is simply superb . \nit is as much his movie as it is frears\' . \nthe film would not be the same without him . \ncusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . \nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . \nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears\' message simply can\'t be ignored or overseen . \nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . \nboth ______ and jack black are fabulous . \neven catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . \nhowever , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob\'s co-worker and friend dick . \nthis is such an impressive achievement that it\'s almost worth a oscar-nomination . \nhe is simply a joy to behold . \notherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears\' colorful blend . \npretty much like edward norton\'s "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn\'t follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it\'s dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . \nit\'s a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . \nnothing seems unreal or staged . \nit reflects reality as a mirror . \nas you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . \nyou feel and think and reflect . \nthis effect has become a rarity nowadays . \nalthough it\'s primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity\'\' is secondarily about pop music . \nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . \nmusic is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . \nand so does the movie . \nit is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob\'s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . \nin the end , you have gained something while watching it . \nit\'s not the film of the century or even of the year . \nit\'s not an special effects extravaganza . \nit doesn\'t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . \nit\'s a small movie about the big things . \nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . \n'",1

"b'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it\'s their predictable endings . \nthe devil\'s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \nunfortunately for the devil\'s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \ni don\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \nthe devil\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \nhis life seems to be on the rise . \nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\'s real father . \nis it all just a big nightmare ? \nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\'s life ? \nthe devil\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\'t expect . \nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \nif so , the devil\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \ni went into the devil\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\'t like the ending ? ) . \nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \nthe devil\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \neverything occurs from his perspective . \nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \ni don\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \nit earned its r rating for a reason . \nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \nthis film really isn\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \ni don\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \nsomething the devil\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \nthe cast of the devil\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\'t expect . \nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \ni have never seen him more believable to date . \nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\'s past . \nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \none familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \nthe devil\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \n'",1
"b'i want to be involved in show business one day . \nand i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . \nthis movie proves it for me . \ni was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . \ni also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . \nthey didn\'t . \nkilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can\'t stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . \nthis film is different . \nthe cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he\'s one of those directors who\'s good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn\'t really give an impressive cast anything to do . \nthe cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o\'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could\'ve casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy . \nthe major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze . \nhis accent is so heavy , you can\'t understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody\'ll notice . \nthat\'s the trouble with me , * i * notice . \nschwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does . \npatrick stewart was the person i\'d heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would\'ve been so much better . \nor sean connery , but not arnold "" i\'m not an actor , but i play one in real life "" schwarzenegger . \ni realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would\'ve been nice if they\'d casted a star that had talent for the role . \nakiva goldsmith\'s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film . \nin a regular batman film , they\'d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson\'s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is . \nthere is talk of a fifth batman movie . \nmy interest to see it is low , but i hope it\'s better than this . \nif you don\'t want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster . \nany other . \n'",0
"b'a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . \nin the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko\'s script or direction makes you care much about either character . \nliving in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . \nthis uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . \n24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine "" frame .

"b'ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \nthe review \njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that . "" \nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme\'s recent film choices any better . \nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \nsoldier\'s kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger\'s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it\'s amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn\'t leaving without her story "" . \nwhatever . \nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \nwhen fuelled by don davis\' loud , driving music score , the film\'s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol\' jean-claude moves . \ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \nif only jean-claude weren\'t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \nto place the blame squarely at van damme\'s feet , however , is an injustice . \ni\'m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano\'s script sound good . \none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \nhe cringes , looks down and mutters "" uh . . . uhm . . . \nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \neh he he he "" the script\'s and indeed the entire film\'s only saving grace is goldberg . \nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like "" i really don\'t like that guy "" every time he fails to kill luc . \nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \n'",0
"b""i don't box with kid gloves . \ni don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . ' \nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit's almost as much fun as the film . \n""",1
"b""michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . \nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . \nso in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . \ncongo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . \nit a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . \nthe film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . \nseveral years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . \nthe plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . \nnow that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . \nsuddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . \nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . \ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . \none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . \nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances . \ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . \nthe problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film . \nit has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . \nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . \nthat could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film . \nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . \nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't . \nhoffman's acting seems muted . \njackson seems to laid back . \nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads . \nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance . \nand why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a \ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . \nlook how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . \nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects . \nlevinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . \nperhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium . \nthe result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n""",0
"b'i\'ll be the first to admit it . \nwhen you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . \nyes , it\'s a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \ncertainly , the experience wasn\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\'ll \ngonna tell it the way i remember it . "" \nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \nok . . . maybe \nthat\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini\'s records in the opening scenes of the film . \nand that\'s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn\'s motorboat , but i digress . \nanyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he\'s a really swell guy . \nand then the plot moves on . \nenter miss havisham . . . or \nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \nperhaps it\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\'s nothing . \nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\'s character , and couldn\'t care less about the two characters . \nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \nthere\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \nwithout a strong estella , finn\'s obsession seems baseless . \nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \nfinn\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \nwhat\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \nalthough it\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \nfinn\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\'s romeo+juliet ) . \nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . \nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . \nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you\'d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film . \n'",0

"b'this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . \nbut lo and behold , here comes "" switchback , "" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as "" kiss the girls "" and "" i know what you did last summer . "" \nbut "" switchback "" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . \n "" switchback "" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she\'s watching . \nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . \nhe is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn\'t keep him from offering pursuit . \nlacrosse\'s most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . \nin a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . \nalong the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . \nthis tangent isn\'t a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . \nor is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . \nin a sense , that\'s half of the basic problem with "" switchback .

"b'the general\'s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . \ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . \nwhat\'s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \nbrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth\'s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . \nsoon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . \nebert\'s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . \nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it\'s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . \non a story level , the general\'s daughter is ineptly constructed . \nthe film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille\'s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and "" shocking "" plot developments . \nhaving not read the novel , it\'s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . \nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . \n ( sunderland actually asks brenner , "" why was she killed ? "" \nto which i would have answered , "" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . "" ) \nonly after we\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \nthis would have been bad enough without the west\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \nthe general\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \n'",0
"b'synopsis : a humorless police officer\'s life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist . \nunfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . \nmeanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie . \ncomments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz\'s bestselling novel watchers . \ntechnically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles . \n ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) \nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . \nthis really isn\'t a good movie . \nhave you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? \nwell , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he\'s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . \nthey\'re awful . \nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio . \nscott baio ! \nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up ? \nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \n "" maybe it won\'t be * that * bad "" he may say to himself . \n "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! "" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \nit\'s definately not a koontz book if there isn\'t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people\'s eyeballs . \nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it\'s arguably the most popular of koontz\'s books . \nthe idea behind koontz\'s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target\'s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \nsilly but kind of neat too . \ni\'m sorry . \ni don\'t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \ni suppose i just don\'t want to talk about the movie itself . \nthis turkey is really cheesy . \nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it\'s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \nthe cheese factor is only increased when he\'s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she\'s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \nand the creature ! \nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it\'s okay . \nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat\'s another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film\'s campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film\'s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it\'s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \nfinally , i couldn\'t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as "" bot fodder "" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , "" mystery science theater 3000 .

"b""the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \n""",0

"b'numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \n'",0
"b""the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \nit's director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n""",0
"b'it\'s hard not to recommend "" the others . "" \nthe supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . \nthe cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . \nbut the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . \noverall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child\'s toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . \nwatching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! "" \nas much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same . \nset at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . \nanne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . \nat the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . \nthe two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . \nto make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . \ngrace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . \nthat\'s essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . \nearlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . \nthe visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . \ni also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . \ngrace is a christian and answers her children\'s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . \nwhen mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . \nbut those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . \n "" the others "" sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . \n'",1

"b'i was pleasantly surprised by this film . \nwith a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century\'s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . \nhow much could you dress up the sets ? \nhow many models and computer effects could you use ? \nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? \noh , if i\'ve just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . \nafter having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . \nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i\'ve seen . \ntitanic tells its story in two time periods . \nit starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . \nwhat they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . \nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . \nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team . \nin 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society\'s upper class , boards the titanic for the ship\'s first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . \nshe is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . \non board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society\'s expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic\'s stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it\'s referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . \nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose\'s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . \nthe story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . \ndicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . \nhis is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . \ngirls are going to swoon over him . \nwinslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . \nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character\'s upbringing . \nsimply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . \nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . \nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . \nhis features are such that even when he smiles , there\'s something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . \nhe\'s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . \nlike dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . \nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal\'s personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century ) . \nno matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . \nadditionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack\'s friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . \nnice to see dr . bombay getting work . \nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . \nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship\'s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . \nin this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . \nyou don\'t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . \nas i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . \nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . \nwith regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . \ncameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . \ncould\'ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . \nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . \nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . \nthese technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . \nin all , james cameron\'s titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . \nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer\'s attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie\'s intriguing beginning to it\'s satisfactory ending . \nin box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship . \n'",1
"b""a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . \na prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . \nless successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . \nnow comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . \nlike 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . \njulia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . \njosh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . \no was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . \nthe movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? \n- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . \nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . \nand that is how it should be . \nof all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . \nkaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . \nthe young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . \nplus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . \nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic . \nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . \nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . \nthe performances in o vary . \nphifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . \nhe also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . \nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . \nstiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . \nthe film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . \nalso desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . \nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . \nit is irrational . \nbut these are minor carpings . \noverall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . \nif nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . \n""",1
"b'airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . \nafter all , it\'s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . \neven if most people don\'t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . \nbut although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! \nremains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . \nin the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . \nfilms like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . \nthere was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . \nand so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . \nthis time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . \n . \n . \nit had to do with bad fish . \nairplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . \nunable to stop living in the past , ted\'s world fell apart . \nhe spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . \nin a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . \nunfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . \nin the midst of it all , something happens . \nsomeone gets sick . \nthen another . \nthen another . \nsoon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . \n . \n . \nand when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? \n ( gee , i wonder ) \nof course the main draw here is the non-stop "" whiz-bang "" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . \nalthough i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . \nthe most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . \nhe\'s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . \nin a film like this , you\'re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can\'t complain about the amateurish quality . \nwhat you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . \nthis character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . \ni don\'t know why he was put in there , and i don\'t think anybody will find a good excuse . \nand when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . \nyou gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . \naside from that , airplane ! \nis really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . \nit would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven\'t seen it . \nand if they ask what the plot is , just tell \'em "" it\'s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that\'s not important right now .

"b'there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \nit is an important scene for several reasons . \nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 ) . \nthe angels here are stark and believable . \nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\'s not enough . \nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human . \nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n . y . p . d . \nblue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\'s haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire . "" \nwenders\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\'t suffer extensive damage . \nthis may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it . \nand yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie . \nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \nwhat is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \nit\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \nit doesn\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n____________________________________________ visit "" charlie don\'t surf !

"" ) . \nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \nalthough he doesn\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \ncomplicating matters , cameron\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \nas you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\'t even mentioned , such as kat\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she\'s all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you\'re vapor "" ) . \nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \naside from a good screenplay , it\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the \'60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? "" \nat another point , bianca and kat\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\'s like to be pregnant . \n "" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \'90s . \nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \nby the film\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about "" 10 things i hate about you , "" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \n'",1
"b'uncompromising french director robert bresson\'s "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory\'s "" morte darthur . "" \ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . \nchivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal . \nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin\'s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ\'s blood . \nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \nthe opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \nsince the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn\'t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \nbut , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \nrather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \nlancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \nthe greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur\'s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \nwhen sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot\'s defense . \nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men\'s hearts and minds . \n "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \nhe uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \nthe music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film\'s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \nlike most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \nall the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \ninstead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \nin some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn\'t . \nthe final montage of arthur\'s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \nhowever , other times bresson\'s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \nfor instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses\' legs . \nhe does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \nwhile there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \nnevertheless , "" lancelot of the lake "" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . \nbresson\'s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . \nby re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns "" lancelot of the lake "" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . \n'",1
"b'a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . \neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . \ndan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed "" mission from god "" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . \nas we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother\'s death in prison years ago . \ncompletely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . \nbut elwood isn\'t completely without family . \nit seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . \ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . \nworking as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother\'s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . \nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . \nevan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . \nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . \nmeanwhile , cab\'s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . \n>from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . \nthose hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . \nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . \nfor those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . \nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . \nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . \nmany , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don\'t have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you\'ll be bored out of your skull . \nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd\'s self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . \nand seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . \nunfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film . \n'",0
"b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) "" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space "" , and is monitoring nelson\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\'s sidekick , tv\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen "" this island earth "" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\'s standards , are less than impressive . \nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\'t particularly funny , but at least they\'re fairly short . \nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of "" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies "" it does well . \n'",1
"b""of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . \nthink about it . \nfrankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . \nif you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . \nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . \nthere's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . \n ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . ) \nbut you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . \nyou can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . \nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . \nwere it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . \nany day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . \nor , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . \nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . \nin this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . \nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . \nblade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . \nhe is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . \nyet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . \nlike any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . \nfor some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . \n ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) \nunfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . \nthe replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance . \nblade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . \nwith a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . \nas it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying . \n""",1
"b'robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . \nthe film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city\'s police force . \n1991\'s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . \nto make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . \non murphy\'s first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . \n ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) \nafter the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . \nrecruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program . \nusing the remains of murphy\'s body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . \nthe cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . \nengineers have erased murphy\'s memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . \nwith his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . \nenvisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit\'s problems . \nthe remainder of the plot follows robocop\'s crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . \nas a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . \ndutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . \nseveral sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . \nbecause robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . \nalthough the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . \nrather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . \nthe movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . \nthese news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . \nthe satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . \n1990\'s america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . \nthe humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . \nverhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . \nunfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . \nthe movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . \nrobocop\'s main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy\'s character . \nwe never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . \ndoes murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? \nthe script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . \nmoreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . \nrobocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . \nas you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . \nin many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . \nhowever , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off . \n'",1

"b'john boorman\'s "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \nof course , wood\'s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) . \nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn\'t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 ) . \nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \nif boorman is anything , he\'s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it\'s in grand fashion . \nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \n "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman\'s . \nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie\'s plot . \nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \nit\'s more middle ages than space age . \nthe world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \nlike "" the wizard of oz , "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \n ( this flying head is one of the movie\'s opening images , and it\'s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can\'t procreate and take up more resources . \nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , "" the gun is good . \nthe penis is evil . "" \nthat line alone is worth the movie\'s cult following . \none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz\'s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \nonce there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \ni say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is . \nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor . \nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \nhe got exactly that in "" zardoz , "" and it\'s a wonder it didn\'t end his career . \ni\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \n'",0

"b'it\'s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of "" award-winning "" tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . \nthat said , hayes\'s feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . \nbut occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . \nthose moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film\'s two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother . \ngyllenhall\'s sweet-natured delivery of jimmy\'s hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld . \nhis mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he\'s befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door . \njimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss . \nbut when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love . \nthe offensive bits have little to do with jimmy\'s rare handicap ( regardless of what the film\'s protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . \nbut even if you find stereotype humor funny , it\'s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags . \nthey even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks . \nbut a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called "" bright \'n shiny , "" led by the inimitable fabio . \nunfortunately , a few giggles can\'t make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . \nhonestly , it\'s a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i\'m not just saying that because it\'s so mediocre . \nhow odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn\'t seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many . \nand now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney\'s wondering the same thing . \nhope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile . \n'",0
"b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \nit\'s confounding . \ni can\'t believe a film can be this bad . \nand yet , it\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\'t want to kill himself . \nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\'s good to help people . \nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \nso patch decides that he\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \nevery scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \nwe don\'t know patch yet , but there\'s sad music , and it\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\'s sad . \nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \nreal drama is character-based . \nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \nwe don\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\'s simply a vehicle for patch\'s greatness . \nreal drama doesn\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \nthat\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\'s sickening musical score . \nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \nbut it\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \nyou see , patch is a really great student . \nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\'s cheating . \nbut patch doesn\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \n "" why don\'t we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds . \nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \nmost of us have to study . \nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\'t be too successful in preventing death . \noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! "" \nyes ! \nthat is true ! \nand you can not do that without studying . \nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \nfollow the rules ? \nbah ! \nwho needs the rules ! \nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \nand then there\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \na free clinic . \nin the middle of the forest . \nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \nfor free . \nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \nwill it have an emergency room ? \nor is it just for mental patients ? \nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\'t explore or challenge patch\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \ni know nothing about him . \nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \ni won\'t tell you that you can\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \n'",0

"b'the general\'s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we\'ll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . \nit\'s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . \nthat , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . \nthe punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general\'s daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . \nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army\'s criminal investigation division . \nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . \ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . \ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . \nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain\'s past that make the case ever more sordid . \nif only the sordidness were the worst of the general\'s daughter\'s problems . \nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . \ndirector simon west likely thinks he\'s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film\'s fatal flaw . \nit\'s a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story\'s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . \ncharacters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell\'s still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . \nwest just can\'t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general\'s daughter . \nhe even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . \nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . \nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell\'s mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . \nthere\'s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . \nindeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" shouldn\'t you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? "" ) . \neven the lame device of brenner and sunhill\'s sexual history provides a few winning zingers . \ngoldman\'s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you\'ll find in most so-called comedies . \ndialogue , unfortunately , just isn\'t enough to make a quality script . \nit\'s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . \nby the time the general\'s daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west\'s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . \nit\'s silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . \ngoldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . \n'",0
"b'the idea at the center of the devil\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- "" the last humanist "" . \nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , "" vanity -- by far my favorite sin "" . \nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( "" lemme givya a piece o\' inside wisdom on god . . .

"b""is evil dead ii a bad movie ? \nit's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . \nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . \n`well what's it about ?

' \n`it's funny to see people die ? \nare you sick or something ? ' \nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \nan example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \nsure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \nbut it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . \n""",1
"b'the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam . \n ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . ) \nwhile driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt . \nmaj . archie gates\' ( who\'s steering ) command requests a beach boys tune . \nthese men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles . \nour three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don\'t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it\'s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . \nthey are gates , new father sgt . \ntroy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt . \nchief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt . \nconrad vig ( music video director jonze ) . \nat story\'s start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends . \nbarlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion . \ngates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt . \nditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy . \nso is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam\'s men are threatening the dictator\'s detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence . \nwhen gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help . \n ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . ) \ngates convinces the vault\'s guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck . \nthe situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges . \nbut the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces . \nthe result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . \nbarlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . \nhis interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child . \n ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . ) \ni liked these scenes best , because the political became personal . \nit\'s one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it\'s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib . \nrussell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man\'s affair with his bedridden mother . \n ( it\'s great . ) \nhis second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish . \none could argue that it\'s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence . \nwhen barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we\'re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast . \nthree kings is russell\'s first visually arresting picture . \nstylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas . \nnewton thomas sigel\'s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate . \none practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen . \n ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it\'s like having sand in your eyes . "" ) \nthis also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade . \n ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . ) \nrussell throws plenty at sigel\'s camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell\'s previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film\'s most realistic , even the most poignant . \n ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) \nif anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us . \nits climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell . \nsubsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow\'s post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status . \n ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . ) \nclooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , "" let my people go ! "" \nhayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell\'s filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture . \n ( it\'s not spoiling much to write that . ) \nthen again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ? \n ( there\'s already enough cynicism in the film\'s mentioning of kuwait\'s oil-infested waters . ) \nrussell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared . \nif he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded . \nwith flair . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . \neven with a handgun , however , he can\'t take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . \ncomments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . \nnot only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . \nthis will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn\'t show in this mess ) . \nhenstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . \n ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) \nhow on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . \nadrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . \nboston has changed dramatically in those ten years . \nit is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors . \nsome guy has a really bad virus , and he\'s killing people because of it . \nso , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . \nthat\'s it . \n76 minutes never seemed so long . \nthis is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . \nthe plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert\'s character and very little about henstridge\'s character . \nthe dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . \na subplot does exist involving henstridge\'s character\'s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . \nin her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . \ntwenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . \nin a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . \nthis fake passport drops to the ground . \nlambert\'s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . \nmust not have been a good fake . \nthis emphasizes another fault with the film . \nthings just defy common sense . \nlambert\'s cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . \nadrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn\'t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . \ni found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . \ndon\'t fear the rush . \nfear the movie . \nwatch something else . \n'",0
"b""this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \ntarzan continues this trend . \nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \n""",0
"b""saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . \nstarring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . \nit may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . \ntom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . \naction , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . \nafter the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . \ni'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . \ntom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . \nthis time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . \noccasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . \nedward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . \nspielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . \nand what battle scenes they are ! \nthey're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . \nthe battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . \nthe gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . \nthis film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . \nother factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . \nthe cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . \nit is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . \nbut while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . \nit is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . \nthe film never really makes any profound statements . \nthis is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . \nstill , the script could of been a lot better . \nthankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . \nsaving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . \nthis film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . \nit really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie . \n""",1

"" \nquinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . \nso , what\'s a kickboxing mercenary to do ? \nquinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . \nwith crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman\'s lite brite locks , "" double team "" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . \nbut too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . \nthe numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what\'s going on in the movie . \nand much of what\'s going on is just wacky . \nthere\'s a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . \nand the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn\'s baby boy ( who\'s in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . \ndid i mention "" double team "" is strange ? \nwhen it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . \nrodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . \nbut we didn\'t need "" double team "" to tell us he could do that , did we ? \n'",0

"b'the postman delivers but not first class \nthe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \n[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . \neven worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable . \nread the following with those particular grains of salt . ] \nit\'s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . \ndue to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . \nalthough this is the future , it looks like a western . \nas the film opens , kevin costner ( his character\'s name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . \ngiving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . \nrunning into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . \nthe rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the "" clan "" \nafter a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . \ntaking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . \nonce he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the "" restored congress of the united states of america "" . \nthis scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . \nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . \nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . \nalthough the postman knows he\'s running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids\' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . \nthe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists\' tyranny . \nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . \nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . \nit\'s derivitive of costner\'s own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns . \nthere\'s little here that we haven\'t seen dozens of times before . \nthe film is often down-right corny . \na scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . \nthe film\'s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . \ndespite the film\'s excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . \nwhat was the war about ? \nhow did civilization change so rapidly ? \neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? \nthe "" law of eights "" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? \nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn\'t made their way west to help or conquer ? \nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn\'t appear to make sense . \nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . \nthe evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" , but why ? \nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? \nwhy is the general named "" bethlehem "" ? \nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ? \nsometimes the movie feels like a joke . \nan army of postal workers armed with guns ? \nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . \nit\'s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . \ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it\'s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film\'s nationalism . \neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . \nit\'s doubtful that "" the postman "" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . \nbesides we\'re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the "" michael redman "" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . \nperhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner\'s postal service . ) \n'",1

' ) . \nthere's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks . \nit's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) . \nultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . . \nand i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations . \npros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head . \ncons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg . \nyoung children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) . \nrunning time is a bit short . \nwould you recommend this to friends ? \nnot to my friends , but to the movie-going public i would . \nscore : or with no 0 rating ) . \n""",1

"b' "" america\'s sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \n "" america\'s sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \nit\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy . \nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\'s solo films have tanked . \nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \nwhat lee doesn\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \nthe "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \nwhen they do deal with journalists , the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed . \ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \nlee certainly isn\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in "" america\'s sweethearts "" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \nso what about the cast ? \njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "" comic relief "" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed "" too broad . "" \nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \ncome to think of it , "" little to work with "" is the operative phrase for this movie . \nas a hollywood satire , "" america\'s sweethearts "" is toothless . \nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been "" much ado about nothing .

"b'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \n "" get new jobs ! "" \nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\'s nothing he hasn\'t done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\'s "" the short happy life of francis macomber "" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \n'",0

"b""one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . \nif a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap . \nbut if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent . \nboogie nights falls into the latter catagory . \nthe director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . \nmark whalberg , a . k . a \nmarky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . \njack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . \nafter running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . \nin the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . \nwe learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . \nbut the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . \nthe direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . \nthere are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . \nthe writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) \nboogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) \nthe soundtrack is also excellent . \nlike american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . \nalso , the costumes are great . \nthe clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . \nthe film , although excellent , does have some flaws . \nfirstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . \nin both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . \nbut the rest of the cast are excellent . \nburt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) \nanother flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . \nit seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . \nit's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . \nbut they're small niggles really . \nboogie nights is an excellent film . \nsuperb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . \nwhatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights . \n""",1

"b""the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . \nwhat does takes place is more based on character development . \nthe film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . \nwhat they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . \nnick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . \n ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) \ncarol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . \nobviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out . \nit's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned . \nand why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years . \nset in a small ( fictional ? ) \ntown in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . \nthe name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . \nparticularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . \nnot an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future . \ninteresting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it . \n""",1

"b'while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens\' "" blood simple . "" \nboth are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . \nthe body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \nboth films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they\'d accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \nas the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . \na man named hugo moves into the apartment\'s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . \njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \nother than the obvious question of why they don\'t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \ni will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn\'t give away too much of the plot . \nbroadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo\'s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \na police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \ndavid , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \nwhile i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \nthis could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \ngranted , this isn\'t really a "" happy "" ending , but it\'s still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \ni really shouldn\'t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \nyes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i\'d been cheated . \nstill , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \ni guess i just can\'t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . \n'",1

"b'i still can\'t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . \nnow before you go assuming i\'m some sort of high brow snob , who can\'t appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \ni thought there\'s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler\'s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \nit\'s really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it\'s just that so far he hasn\'t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \nthe team\'s somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \nyou can figure out the rest from here . \nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \nfairuza balk plays sandler\'s leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a "" coaching for dummies "" -style book to help him get through games . \nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler\'s overprotective and overbearing mama . \neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \nwhich is sad , because i can\'t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \nit\'s obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \nit\'s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \n'",0

"b'if you\'re debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? \nthe only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph\'s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . \neveryone else--and i\'m hoping that\'s most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . \nactually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover\'s exit 11 motor village in midland city . \nnot only is he a huge success as a businessman , he\'s also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . \nwith a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he\'s not . \nhis wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny .

"" \nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \nhe\' s awfully one-note , but it\'s not as if he\'s given any more notes to work with . \nthe rest of the cast does even less . \ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \nphillips broods . \ncruz flirts with the computer . \nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\'t paying much attention by then . \n "" supernova "" is pretty awful , but i\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \nthat\'s it . \nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\'t going to save the film . \nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\'s what "" supernova "" is . \n'",0

"b""not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . \nin fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . \nyet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . \nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . \nboth musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . \nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . \ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . \nthe performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . \nthey contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . \nthe frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . \nthe script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . \ncottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . \nthe latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . \nsome will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . \nnevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around . \n""",1

"b'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \nthe other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\'s films as it is here . \nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella . "" \nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \nyou honestly don\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \nyou\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\'ve seen on film in the 1990\'s . \nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \nplaying sex symbols throughout the \'80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\'s well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989\'s "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \nafter "" pretty woman , "" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released "" runaway bride , "" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n "" pretty woman "" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\'d expect , and wouldn\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie\'s overall fulfillment , "" pretty woman "" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n'",1
"b'i didn\'t realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what\'s g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . \n "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . \nit\'s brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . \nit tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . \nregardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they\'re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . \nthe movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . \nit contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . \nas with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . \nbut , that\'s the movie . \nnow back to the preview . \nprior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . \nthere was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn\'t one of the seven words you can\'t say on tv ) . \nexcept for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . \nhmmmmm . \nwhen i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone .

"b' "" desperate measures "" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \'97 . \nfor some reason , it was delayed until hollywood\'s traditional dumping ground : january . \nnow that it\'s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it\'s a simple yet highly entertaining film . \nmichael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who\'s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . \nkeaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . \nhe succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . \nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . \nthe film definately has it\'s flaws . \nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . \nalso , after keaton\'s escape , garcia\'s captain barks at him "" how many men have to die to save your kid\'s life ?

"b'there\'s good news and bad news about mulan . \nthe positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . \non the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . \nbut mulan is a step in the right direction and disney\'s best animated feature since the lion king . \nafter giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . \nmulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . \nthat\'s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . \ncartoons . . . \nmeanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . \nsince mulan\'s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . \nshe pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . \nthat\'s chinese culture for you . . . \nso imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father\'s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . \nthe movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . \nit should have been called g . i . \nchang . \nmulan calls on her ancestors for help . \nthey decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . \nvoiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . \nmurphy\'s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they\'re going to have . \nyou ain\'t never had a friend like mushu . \nspeaking of songs , mulan doesn\'t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . \ndisney songs about war probably wouldn\'t go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it\'s off to war i go . . . "" ) , and the ones they do have aren\'t memorable . \nthe best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song . \nyes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . \nsung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan\'s platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . \nit makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that\'s ended badly ? \ni only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . \nfor the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . \nall she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . \nthe deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . \nbut she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . \nas a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . \ni saw the movie yesterday and i don\'t remember the man\'s name . \notherwise , mulan is a good movie . \nthe animation of the characters themselves isn\'t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . \neddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . \nhell , george "" mr . sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan . \nyou get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let\'s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . \nwho can you think of ?

"b""the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 ) \nstarring : tim curry and susan sarandon \ncult films are never mainstream . \nthe casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ?

"b'michael robbins\' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . \nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic "" big game , "" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . \nall that\'s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \ni can\'t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . \nout of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . \ninstead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . \nreeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . \nthe drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . \nand maybe , just maybe , they\'ll play in the big championship game . \none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle\'s non-fiction book , is that there aren\'t any . \nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \nthat wouldn\'t be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \nmost of the kids\' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \nthere\'s little that\'s naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can\'t find the right words to express myself . \nthe adults also don\'t fare well . \nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves\' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \nit\'s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , "" these kids trust you , and they don\'t trust anyone ! "" \nthen there\'s d . b . \nsweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves\' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you\'ve seen before and hope never to see again . \ni wanted hardball to be good . \nrobbins\' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . \ni haven\'t seen robbins\' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that "" macho man "" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . \nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . \nhere\'s hoping that happens in the immediate future . \n'",0
"b'jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\' king kong . \nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \nhush is one such example . \nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \nthe film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama . \nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\'s a declaration of war . \nhush has three very simple problems : it\'s incredibly dumb , it\'s incredibly boring , and it\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\'s bare buttocks . \nfrankly , it\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \nhere , it\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \nof course , since schaech\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \nmaybe someone should ask him if he\'s familiar with oedipus . \nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \nhow do we know she\'s evil ? \nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \nthe evidence for this is that she\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \nthat\'s about it for character development . \nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \ni can\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\'t especially good . \nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \nin general , however , they\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \nthat\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \n'",0
"b""in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . \nin the second , he was avenging his daughter . \nin the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . \nfourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . \nhowever , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . \nthis time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . \nkersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . \neven such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . \nwhite's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . \nthe plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . \nfourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . \nhowever , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . \nhowever , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . \nthere are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . \nthe script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . \nthere are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . \n ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . \n""",0
"b""it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . \nand no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . \nreally , i don't . \nnot at all . \nthe plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . \nthe center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? \nin the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . \nshe immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . \nhe , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . \nafter a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . \nkate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . \nto add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . \nsupporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing . \ntheir purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . \nto do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . \nrarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them . \nthis is the love letter's damning error . \ncapshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional . \nbecause of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . \neven worse -- it's a bore . \ni liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . \nthere is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing . \nthis is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities . \nbut it's far from profound . \nthere isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . \nreally , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . \nbut bad , it is . \nawful , it also is . \nthe love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n""",0

"b'so much for sweet returns . \nafter smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80\'s slasher movies , starting with 1996\'s "" scream , "" and followed by "" scream 2 , "" "" urban legend , "" and the original , "" i know what you did last summer , "" a film like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" was bound to be made sooner or late . \nit is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . \nit has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . \nsince then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . \nwhen julie\'s friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla\'s horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn\'t show up . \nwhen they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . \nof course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren\'t the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . \nit is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" is made . \ni am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to "" ikwydls , "" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a "" friday the 13th "" movie . \nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn\'t return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , "" i still know . . .

"b'the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn\'t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \nbille august\'s high-profile adaptation of victor hugo\'s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \nfor those not familiar with hugo\'s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean\'s prison camp , on his trail . \nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \nthe "" father "" and "" daughter "" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year\'s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla\'s sense of snow . \nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush\'s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \nwhile i was touched by valjean\'s relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \nnot even reaching the "" touching "" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others\' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius\'s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \n'",1

"b'wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you\'re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . \nthere is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . \nthis is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . \nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . \ni\'ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . \nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it\'s a thriller with a real story . \nwhat it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . \neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . \nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . \nusing this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . \nthat\'s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what\'s around the next corner . \nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . \nboth have an abundance of screen time , although i\'ll admit that the film\'s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . \nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . \nthe soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don\'t generate much heat . \nthe lesbian kisses can\'t hold a candle to those in bound . \ntheresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . \nthe film\'s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . \nmaybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . \nkevin bacon ) is familiar with . \nthe director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . \nthat movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . \nit\'s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . \nbut i suppose we all need to put food on the table . \nmcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . \nquick cuts and pretty sunrises can\'t even begin to cover up this movie\'s flaws . \nthe main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida\'s blue bay high school . \na student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . \none afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . \nafter confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . \nthey are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . \nmeanwhile , sam , convinced that he\'s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . \nthe acting in wild things isn\'t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . \nthis is definitely not a character- based motion picture . \nnot only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn\'t bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . \nthe men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . \nmatt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . \nneve campbell gets to model the slutty look . \ndenise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . \nand nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . \nthe only one who\'s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he\'s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he\'s got the right idea ) . \ncolumbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film\'s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? \nwild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . \nthanks to jeffrey kimball\'s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton\'s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . \nbut , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks . \n'",0

"b""synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . \n ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) \nin the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . \na girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . \nmulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . \nten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . \nthe emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . \nmulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . \nthe disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . \nin disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . \nold mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . \nfearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . \nmeanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . \n ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) \nmushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . \nwith the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? \nopinion : east meets west . \ni know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . \nfrom their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . \ni mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? \nyet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . \nthe end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . \npersonally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . \nmulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . \nkids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . \nand adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . \nand adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . \nbut even the tiniest details reveal quality . \nthe movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . \ncomputers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . \nand singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . \nbalance is crucial . \na movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! \nthe dream team . \nby the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . \nit's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . \nit's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . \n""",1
"b'\'pleasantville\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \n ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) \ncast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . \nwalsh , jeff daniels \nmpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements \ngenre : drama \nin my opinion : \nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \nput simply , it\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an "" oldies "" tv station ? or is it ? \ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \nbut it wasn\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy "" dollar theaters "" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all . \ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \nnow i\'m not saying that\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \nthat said , the plot goes as such . \ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\'s high school twins with the typical "" relationship "" outline of don\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\'t-mess-with-yours . \nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \npeople got hurt . \nthey cried . \nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\'ll never know what we could have done better . \nuntil the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr \n'",1
"b'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\'s protagonist . \nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \nhe\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \nlacrosse knows his killer\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \nit wouldn\'t be fair to reduce everything that\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\'s presence , but it\'s a pretty good place to start . \nthere\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \nit\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \neven without quaid , it doesn\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \nonce the mystery of the killer\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \nin fact , "" stale and predictable "" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \nit\'s too bad stuart wasn\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \ninstead , stuart places his trust in a "" name "" star who can\'t carry the material . \nmaybe next time he\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \n'",0
"b'perhaps if the impostors didn\'t have so much going for it , it wouldn\'t have been such a tremendous disappointment . \nwritten , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . \nsputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . \nthe film\'s other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator\'s aide in bulworth . \nthe bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . \nall are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . \n ( the audience will easily identify with allen\'s sentiments . ) \nwith the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . \nthe stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . \nthe plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . \nin order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship\'s stewards . \nthe over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . \nwhen the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice\'s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . \nat other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . \nwith the film\'s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . \nthe press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . \ntoo bad they weren\'t more concerned with the audience\'s potential enjoyment . \nthe jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . \none wonders if anyone ever viewed the film\'s dailies . \nsurely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . \nit is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn\'t pull it off , they should have just given up . \n "" the show is over for this fella , "" steve buscemi\'s character says towards the end . \nthe mystery is why they didn\'t all give up in the beginning . \nthere must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . \nthe impostors runs 1 : 42 . \nit is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . \n'",0
"b'attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . \nshould the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . \nthe film will work just as well as a silent movie . \nchronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . \nfirst-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . \nthere isn\'t one of these characters worth caring about . \nthe movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of "" people magazine .

"b'after enduring mariah carey\'s film debut , glitter , i\'m reminded of a bit from chris rock\'s bigger and blacker . \nin response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , "" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don\'t mean it should be done . "" \nto that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don\'t mean it should be done . \nsure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles\' a hard day\'s night to the spice girls\' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . \neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . \nstart off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . \nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . \nworse yet , everyone\'s speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . \nmeant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . \ninfluential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . \nin predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie\'s on "" the roller coaster of superstardom . "" \nin the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . \ni won\'t give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . \nyou\'ll figure it out . \nthe movie screams to be made with camp , and that could\'ve been fun . \nbut the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . \nwhat a mistake . \nthe brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie\'s first music video -- go over like lead balloons . \ninstead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah\'s most dramatic scenes . \nwhich brings us to the performances , of which there\'s nothing good that can be said . \nmariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . \nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene . \nbut you have to wonder if the writing isn\'t even worse . \nso much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey\'s virginal target audience that it\'s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . \neven the characters couldn\'t have been written more absurdly . \nthey\'re all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , "" billie , i\'d love to put you in a movie i\'m making , "" and the big-time record executive who takes billie\'s demo tape and says , "" oh , i\'ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "" \neveryone in the film is a device , and it\'s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . \nto say more would be a waste . \nthere\'s so much wrong with this film . \nand , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she\'s likely to get . \nbut , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . \n'",0

"b'my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . \nas sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i\'ve ever witnessed . \nsure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? \nthen there\'s "" caligula . "" \nthis film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man\'s rear , wine poured down a man who\'s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time . \nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there\'s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . \nafter all , it\'s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . \nno film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it\'s about , it\'s about how it\'s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . \nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that\'s that it\'s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \n "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or \nso i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . \nthe film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . \nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can\'t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o\' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . \nthen he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn\'t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . \nthe filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . \nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione\'s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . \noh , isn\'t it great that they just loved having sex ? \nand that they killed people so disgustingly ? \nand wouldn\'t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it\'s so blatantly real bad porn that i\'ve completely convinced myself that it\'s not . \ni mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . \nand it\'s not just that it\'s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it\'s that in a film where the entire feel it\'s going for isn\'t felt , it\'s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . \nthe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . \nbut that doesn\'t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . \nthe camera operation is also the worst i\'ve ever seen in my entire life . \nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . \nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . \nthere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it\'s "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can\'t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . "" ) \nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . \nthe orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" ) . \njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i\'m going to kill my agent , i\'m going to kill my agent . . . "" \nand so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula "" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . \nguccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . \nthroughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with ! \nand if you don\'t like this , then you\'re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! "" \nuh huh . \nthere\'s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that\'s artistically good . \na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . \nbut using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness\'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . \nthere\'s a film that came out in 1989 called "" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , "" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . \nthat film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . \nthere were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it\'s going to be offensive to many . \nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . \nand it\'s everything "" caligula "" might have been but , alas , wasn\'t . \n'",0
"b'battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid \nbattlefield earth \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nin my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare . \nbehind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . \nno scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway . \nno matter what i did , the view didn\'t change : travelling but not getting anywhere . \neach time i awoke in a sweat , terrified . \nyou don\'t have to be carl jung to understand that dream . \npowerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . \nthis is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins . \nfor all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard\'s science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 . \ndull "" and "" stupid . \nin the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years . \nhumans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians . \nthere\'s no hope . \nthe future is bleak . \nthen the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race . \nit\'s an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise . \nconsidering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it\'s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably . \nbut it does . \nthe story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits . \nare we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? \nor that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? \nor that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? \nor that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don\'t notice that their slaves are missing for days ? \ntravolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he\'s worth and is almost entertaining . \nalmost . \nthe rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter . \nsome of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar . \na race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin . \nsound like something charlton heston might be in ? \nthe psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune "" . \nthe final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with . \nit\'s too loud . \nit\'s too oppressive . \nit\'s too slow . \nit\'s too long . . . far \ntoo long . \nand on it goes . \nthe list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless . \nit\'s difficult to find anything in the film that does work . \noh yeah . \nthe color scheme is nice . \nthe real question is how this movie ever got made . \ncould it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? \nand that john travolta is a member of the church . \nthat might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago . \nbut it doesn\'t give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell\'s atrocious script was used . \nor why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film . \nor why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems . \nthe one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner\'s "" the postman "" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be "" the "" big budget science fiction failure . \n "" battlefield earth "" has the honor sewed up . \noften reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video . \nthat\'s not the case here . \nyou can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one . \ndon\'t hesitate . \nstrike now while the iron is cold . \n'",0
"b'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nwild wild west \na better name for this movie might\'ve been "" wild wild waste "" . \nwarner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib\'s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . \nbut somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . \nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would\'ve made all the difference- a story writer . \nwild wild west\'s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . \nif warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would\'ve possibly been five times better than what it is . \nheck , ten times . \nas is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he\'s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . \nhere\'s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . \nthey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . \nas i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . \nbut the acting doesn\'t help either . \nkevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . \nsmith seems to be having a better time as west , although he\'s not nearly as charming as he was in mib . \nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can\'t even stand to look at him or his strange beard . \nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . \nher acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass "" . \ndirector barry sonnenfeld isn\'t of great help either . \neven though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . \nit\'s as if he feels he\'s directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you\'re helming what\'s supposed to be a big-screen hit . \nlast but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . \nat one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline\'s train . \nhe jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it\'s still in motion ! \nalso , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . \nlast but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he\'s not kissing a woman as he\'s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! \nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . \nthe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . \nthere\'s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . \ni would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn\'t possible . \nif the racist and sex jokes don\'t bother you , the performances will . \nif the performances don\'t bother you , the story will . \nif the story doesn\'t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . \nthere\'s no end to the vicious circle . \ngo rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . \nyou\'ll have a better time . \nif you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . \ni bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . . \n'",0
"b""let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \nthe world is not enough is no exception . \nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \nhow about the cast ? \nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \nthen there are the bond girls . \nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \nthen we have denise richards . \nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \nso how does it stack up ? \ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \n""",1
"b'capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . \nsimmer for 100 minutes . \nyields : zilch . \nthe phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud . \nit\'s hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn\'t simply recycle its predecessors , and i\'ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully . \nthe phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn\'t even bother to be graceful . \nit\'s a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i\'ll try . \nthe film opens up with a "" prelude "" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out . \nwe go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from "" sorcerer "" as well ! \nsorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain . \nboth versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i\'ve got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go . \nanyway , the cinematic theft doesn\'t stop there . \nor at least the lack of inspiration . \nthere isn\'t a single thing here we haven\'t seen , and it\'s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest . \nwe have ( where\'s my list ? ) \na bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr . \nno than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself . \nwhat else is there ? \nthe plot is a waste of time . \nthe sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey . \nthere are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i\'m sure once mike and the \'bots get the cash , they\'ll stick it on their sked . \nthe only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he\'s a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another . \nall i can say is that i pray this isn\'t the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie . \n'",0
"b'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \'90s thriller . \nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\'re happening . \nthis is a very bad sign . \nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \na perfect murder isn\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \ntheir marriage isn\'t going well -- emily resents steven\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \nultimately , i\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\'re not interesting . \n ( it\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\'t . ) \nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\'s best friend . \na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \nthere aren\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \nit\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \nit\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \n'",0
"b'a new entry in the "" revisionist history "" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation\'s biggest presidential scandal . \nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene\'s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president\'s resignation . \nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of "" deep throat "" . \nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad "" dick "" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams "" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! "" \nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it\'s juvenile bathroom humor , but it\'s not . \nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience\'s throat in the least subtle way possible . \ni don\'t recall oliver stone\'s nixon having to pander to it\'s audience , but of course that film wasn\'t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it\'s remarkable supporting cast . \ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch\'s woodward and bernstein . \nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch\'s constant thwarting of ferrell\'s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy\'s brother ) . \nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \ni\'d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as "" dick and poopie "" jokes . \nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \n[pg-13] \n'",0
"b""after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . \nit's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . \nluckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . \nthe story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . \nshe works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . \nbut one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . \njackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . \nsoon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . \nalso entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . \nthe big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . \nit's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . \nthere are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . \nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . \nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . \na 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? \nyou've got to commend the acting . \njackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . \nthe film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . \ntarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . \nalso , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . \njackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . \nyou can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . \nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together . \ngrier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . \nin fact , she's flat-out great . \nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . \nmichael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . \nspeaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . \nthere's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . \nwhich is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . \nthe story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . \nbut oh well . \njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . \nlet's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us . \n""",1
"b' "" i know what you did last summer , "" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996\'s "" scream , "" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997\'s biggest hit of the fall season . \nwhile "" scream "" was a more knowing film about the genre , "" i know what you did last summer "" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the "" friday the 13th "" films ( well , okay , "" jason goes to hell "" was pure hell to sit through ) . \nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \nit is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . \nkind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . \nwhen the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . \ndistraught and confused , they decide they can\'t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . \njulie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . \nswitch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . \nalmost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , "" i know what you did last summer , "" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . \n "" i know what you did last summer , "" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i\'ve seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family\'s store with the killer inside with her . \nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \nheche\'s performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \n "" i know what you did last summer , "" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted "" jump-in-your-seat "" scare . \nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i\'ve ever heard . \nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best "" scream queen . "" \nand gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . \nalthough not up to the level of either "" scream "" movies , or the more recent , "" urban legend , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . \n'",1

"b""one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . \nprofessors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . \nanna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! \narthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . \nmother-in-law jokes prevail . \nfurthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . \nfred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . \nhowever , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . \nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . \nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . \nthis is what binds the movie together . \njoan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . \non the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! \neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . \nalthough the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . \na relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . \n""",1
"b'naturally , at the core of leon gast\'s "" when we were kings "" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was . \nthanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . \nfans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . \nwith the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . \nbut "" when we were kings "" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . \nquestions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . \ngast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . \na member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast\'s film with a forceful swipe at the united states . \nwhen ali hollers "" damn america\' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . \nhis decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : "" no viet cong ever called me nigger "" , ali reasons . \ndespite showcasing ali\'s proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of "" when we were kings "" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . \nlistening to the film\'s numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this "" rumble in the jungle "" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . \nspike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a "" coming home "" to africa . \nforeman reminds us that africa is the "" cradle of civilisation "" . \nfair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . \nit is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . \nwhile ali respects mobutu\'s ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . \nmailer\'s insights are lost on most of the film\'s commentators . \ngeorge plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . \nwith admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire\' s squalid ruling elite . \nmobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . \ndon king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the "" messiah "" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . \nunderstandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . \nhe may be , as one sympathiser notes , "" blacker "" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . \nafrica , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . \nlittle wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali\'s opponent wasn\'t white . \nadmittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . \nthe audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . \nthere is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . \nthe excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . \nand of course there\'s always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - "" we gonna get it on coz we don\'t get along !

"b'in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . \ni realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . \nbut in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception . \nif you haven\'t yet seen it , go see it . \nnow . \nstop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you\'ve seen it , come back . \ni\'ll wait here . \nwelcome back . \nif you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , \ni\'m sure you\'ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life . \namerican beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream . \nit\'s humorous but it isn\'t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production . \nmixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year\'s very best . \nlester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises . \nhe is living life without a purpose . \nhe is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence . \nhe barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live . \nbut one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter\'s ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive . \nwhat he sees is the performance by his daughter\'s friend , the head cheerleader . \nhe develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature . \nbut for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living . \nthis crush is only the beginning . \nlester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( "" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? "" ) , \nbuying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be "" beauty "" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs . \nhis new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor . \nand the burnhams\'s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum . \nricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film\'s thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title . \ncolonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime . \nkevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel . \nhe never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life . \nspacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime . \nequally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness . \nat two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn\'t feel nearly long enough . \nit\'s a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life . \npowerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream . \nit claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it . \nthe dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it\'s all over . \namerican beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it\'s a masterpiece . \n'",1

"b""arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . \nhowever , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . \ndonahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . \nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . \nalthough events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . \nalthough an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . \nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . \nmost of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . \nthe 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . \nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . \nif i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . \nbut no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . \nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . \nwith no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . \ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . \nhowever , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' \na lot , and mike giggling like a loony . \nthere's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . \nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . \nthe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . \nalso , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . \nthere are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . \nthe blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . \ni suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . \napart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . \nthe spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . \nalthough a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . \nit's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com \n ) is better than the film . \n""",0

"" \ntruer words are hard to come by . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . \nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? \nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \nit\'s obvious he truly loves titanic . \nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton\'s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \nrose\'s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn\'t want to marry . \nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \nit\'s the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \nbut as i said above , the love portion isn\'t sappy and doesn\'t "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said . \nit\'s sweet , and it didn\'t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose\'s story , now are totally aborbed by her . \nrose goes out onto the ship\'s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \nwe then see a dream of rose\'s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \n'",1
"b'armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \nstories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \narmageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you\'ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \nbut i loved every freaking minute of it . \nbelieve me , i\'m just as shocked as you are . \nhell , i don\'t even know why i went to see it in the first place . \nthe previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \ni\'m sorry , but "" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! "" \nisn\'t quite the tagging that\'s going to sell a movie . \nit isn\'t too wise either to market the film using the movie\'s stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \ni mean , let\'s face it ; armageddon\'s previews rival the truman show\'s as being some of the worst of the year . \nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \nof course , you all know the story . \nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us\'s top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \nin the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \nbelonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who\'s always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g\'s . \nalso , there\'s the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can\'t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \nbasically , that\'s about it . \nas i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \nit\'s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \ncase in point : nasa doesn\'t know that there is even an asteroid on it\'s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \nanother example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \nhow pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \nwant another one ? \nokay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing "" leaving on a jet plane "" , and soon , all the rest join in . \ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \nbut naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin\' time at the movies . \nand don\'t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \nso even if you don\'t win one of mcdonald\'s free tickets , it\'s still definitely worth checking out . \n'",1
"b""it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . \nafter having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . \none gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . \nthere is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' . \nin fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . \nso what are the lessons learnt : 1 . \ndon't take your children to class reunions . \n2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . \nmichelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' . \nmy comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . \nwhoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . \nlastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind . \n""",1
"b' * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * \ncast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o\'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes \nthe first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but . \ngary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away . \ndon cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot . \nwhen a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o\'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining . \nwhat they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) . \nbefore i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper . \nevery time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it . \nlittle did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products . \ndr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o\'connell shoving m&m\'s in our face . \nthese are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film . \nclich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\'t like independence day ) . \nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\'t help but whisper "" u\'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \nennio morricone\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\'t reach its intended target . \nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be "" smarter "" than i am ) . \nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \na brief history lesson about "" where we came from "" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with "" the rest of our people "" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that "" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has "" ) . \n>from the press i\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \ni\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \nlet\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \ni\'d venture to say it won\'t be worse than this waste of time . \n[pg] \n'",0
"b' "" easely one of the worst films of the year . . "" \nwith the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . \nthis time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . \nthe result is somewhat predictable . \ni didn\'t have high hopes about arnold\'s "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen . \nschwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won\'t be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . \neveryone else will see \'end of days\' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . \nthink of it as hollywood\'s own y2k bug . \ndid you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you\'ll get 999 , as in 1999 ? \nyes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . \nthis time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . \nhe coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . \nthe way it works is he smirks and something explodes . \nbefore the stroke of the new millennium he\'s got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . \nonly schwarzenegger\'s cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . \nfilms like this has one serious weakness -- logic . \nno matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you\'ll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . \nthe incredible fact is that such directors never learn . \nafter thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? . \nhere the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . \nhe is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . \nall he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . \nbut schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . \nso the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back . . i \ncan give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just \ngive me the address . . "" \nindeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . \nand for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger\'s comeback , will not be very satisfied . \nwe\'ve not seen him in a while . \nthat\'s because he didn\'t have a worthy opponent . \nhe has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . \nhe has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . \nso , after all those fights , what\'s left for arnold schwarzenegger ? \nhow about satan ? \nin my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron\'s "" terminator "" . \nand that is schwartzenegger\'s strength -- muscles and no emotions . \nhere he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . \nthis is called "" an adult turn "" if successful and "" a flop "" if unsuccessful . \nmake a wild guess ! \nhis character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . \nthis requires at least some acting skills . \nregrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . \nthe rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . \nthe movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . \nbut the movie doesn\'t serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . \nthe only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . \nthe action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . \nso i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . \nunless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . \nas for schwarzenegger , he\'ll be back . \n'",0
"b'it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . \nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks\' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre\'s toilet paper . \nfrom this opening moment , one can infer shrek\'s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . \nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . \nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . \nthe jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . \nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . \ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . \nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . \ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey\'s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . \nwhether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . \nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . \nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . \nsecondly , upon shrek\'s and donkey\'s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . \nthroughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . \nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . \nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . \nafter the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . \nsurprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . \nin this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one\'s self . \nupon fiona\'s learning of shrek\'s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . \nany child can pull from fiona\'s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . \non the technical side , shrek triumphs . \ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . \nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . \nmyers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings . \nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . \ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . \nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . \nschulman . \nthe script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . \ncapping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . \nwith shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . \nthe smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . \na film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . \n'",1
"b'i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there\'s something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year . \nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . \nit is that good of a film . \nwhen gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into \'96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . \nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \nbut after seeing the farrelly\'s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . \nonce in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . \nand you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . \nnow for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding ) . \nthe movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . \nforget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python\'s meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly\'s assault on the senses . \nin fact , this may even be the funniest film i\'ve ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . \nbut as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart . \nyou see , the farrelly\'s are truly gifted filmmakers . \nthey don\'t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . \nthey also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . \nit\'s funny , though . \nif you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . \nbut believe me , it is anything but . \nben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . \nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . \nearly brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from "" scream "" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . \nin one of the film\'s funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won\'t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . \njump to the present . \nafter years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . \nhealy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . \nadmittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . \nafter all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? \nsomehow , the farrelly\'s pull it off . \nthe performances here are also right on target . \nas ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . \nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary\'s brother . \nno other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . \ni know he won\'t be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . \nas good as the actors are , though , it\'s the directors\' movie all the way . \ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg\'s wwii epic "" saving private ryan "" . \nand yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . \nbut which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can\'t breath for minutes at a time ? \ni\'ll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . \nthere is just something about "" mary "" . \n'",1

"b'in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg . \neight years later , moore and goldberg\'s careers aren\'t exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can\'t be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog . \nforget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games . \ngood truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey . \nalong the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists . \nevery so often , like at the end of a video game "" level "" or "" stage , "" the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns . \njust in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who\'s driving what , all of red\'s vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red . \ni could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack\'s dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance . \nall that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting . \nonce you\'ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you\'ve seen it every time . \nas dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it\'s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work . \nwhile far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence . \ni don\'t know if it\'s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog . \nregardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ? \n'",0

"b'susan granger\'s review of "" ghosts of mars "" ( sony pictures entertainment ) \nhorror auteur john carpenter ( "" halloween , "" "" vampires "" ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that\'s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . \nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year\'s "" pitch black , "" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . \nin the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . \ngrier , pill-poppin\' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch "" desolation "" williams - that\'s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . \nbut when they\'re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . \nit seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as "" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , "" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . \ncarpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the "" night of the living dead "" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . \nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" ghosts of mars "" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . \nperhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : "" mission to mars "" and "" red planet .

"b'according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors "" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . "" \nhmm . \nyou never know , they just might be on to something . \nwhat with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . \nbut then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . \nit\'s cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . \nthat\'s a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . \nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . \nthe movie opens in the fifties with roy\'s dad dishing out the reader\'s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . \nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . \nit\'s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . \nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy\'s hand . \nthen it\'s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . \nhe\'s hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . \nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . \nwith the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that\'s . . . \ndumb and dumber . \nyes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . \nso , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . \nget set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . \nnow , don\'t get me wrong , there\'s nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . \nthe trouble is that these jokes aren\'t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . \nit lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . \nsome gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don\'t do anything . \nwhy the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? \nwhy two of these ? \nwhy does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? \nthe film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , "" wouldn\'t that be funny ? "" . \nwell , no , actually . \nthe actors don\'t do the movie much favours either . \nwoody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please \n ) . \neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie\'s climax . \nall in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . \nwe\'ll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( "" strictly bowling "" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",0

"b'scream 2 isn\'t quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . \ndeath -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . \nand , while there\'s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest \'90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . \nscream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don\'t take their horror too seriously . \nthe success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . \nthe unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . \na sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . \nas stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . \nparadoxically , there\'s a lot less gore . \nthere is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . \ncraven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . \na second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . \nafter all , we\'ve known some of these people for two movies -- it\'s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . \nscream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . \nas in the first picture , there\'s a slick , self-mocking prologue . \nthis time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream ) . \nsome of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it\'s surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . \nshortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . \ncraven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences . \nthey give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . \nstab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell ) . \nsadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . \nit would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante\'s approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . \nfollowing the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . \nher friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he\'s just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . \nonce the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . \nat the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . \nshe has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . \nalso arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . \nin addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . \nthere\'s a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson\'s movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney\'s requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale\'s new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . \nultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . \nfrom the stab scenes to lines like "" brothers don\'t last long in situations like this , "" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . \ntheir resolution to the obligatory "" whodunit ?

"b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \nwords "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\'etat against kimba . \nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \nit shouldn\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \nthe movie doesn\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \nalthough the movie doesn\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\'s reluctant colleague . \nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \nirvin\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\'t help . \nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \n'",1

"b'the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . \nwhen anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king\'s ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . \nmeanwhile , the king\'s prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . \nthe last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king\'s son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . \nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i\'s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . \ni will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . \nthe screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe . \nliterally . \nspeaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . \nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . \nthe sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . \nunlike disney animated features , the king and i\'s songs don\'t add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . \ntake the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i\'s music is at its worst . \nyou\'re being hunted by a dragon ! \nwhat do you do ! ? \nsing a happy song ! \nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don\'t make a positive ? \nbelieve it ! \nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc . , etc . , etc . , "" more and more as the film progresses . \nno personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . \nand where does this character\'s personality change ? \nhey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! \nisn\'t that the whole plot ? \nthe prime minister\'s hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! \nanother one of his teeth fell out ! \nhardy-har-har ! \nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . \nby the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . \nanimated films , such as 1994\'s the lion king and 1998\'s the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . \nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . \ni have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . \nif it wasn\'t for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade .

"b'when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input . \njim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone . \ni\'m not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response . \nan all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis . \nthe mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great "" conjunction "" of three suns . \nalong the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig . \nmuch of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . \nthe puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . \nthe voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect . \nas well , trevor jones\' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . \ni suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn\'t be helped , but i wish the film was longer . \njen and kira have wonderful . . . well , \nchemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated . \nthe dark crystal has a very small cult following . \nthe weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting . \na friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth\'s creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal . \nthat film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of "" the muppet show "" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien\'s fan-base . \n ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) \nthe dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience . \nit\'s the best kind of children\'s entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip . \nbrian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father\'s masterpiece . \n'",1
"b'a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . \nat the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . \nafter robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville\'s ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . \nthe joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . \nand , ultimately ( didn\'t we see this one coming ? ) , \nlove . \nso far , so mediocre . \nbut mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge\'s contextual frame for the romance . \nit turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven\'s police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o\'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . \nthis conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . \nbut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . \nnot that there is much of a romance to begin with . \ntry as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . \nceline is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . \nas such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . \nwhen celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . \nbut i am not exactly sure if boyle and company\'s point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . \nboyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . \nthe cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . \nand then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . \nwatching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . \ninstead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . \nmy best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar . \nafter a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . \nthe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . \nalas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . \ni applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . \na life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . \n "" i can accept failure . \neveryone fails at something . \nbut i can\'t accept not trying . \nit doesn\'t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart .

"b'denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . \nthis perhaps may be washington\'s very best to date . \nhe joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . \nhis very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is . \nwhen his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . \nthe horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . \nthe powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america\'s history . \nhe is that amazing . \nthe problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . \nmainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . \nthis is , without a doubt , washington\'s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . \ndenzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . \nas rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . \n>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . \nthen after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . \ncarter\'s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . \nfrom these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . \nafter several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . \nit was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter\'s book in the 1980\'s , that a serious battle for freedom took place . \nthe young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . \nthe greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . \nwashington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . \nthe devastation in washington\'s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . \nin the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . \nhis anger is heightened to a point of no control . \nwe see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . \nwe see an emotional boxing match inside carter\'s head . \nfrom this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . \nit is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . \nwhen carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . \nwhite people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . \nhowever , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . \nhe realizes that society is changing . \nthat racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . \nvery rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . \nif only the other actors had this same determination . \ndan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . \nit felt like his character was taken straight out of a "" scooby doo "" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn\'t for those annoying little kids . \n "" the kids "" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . \nthe lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in "" shawshank redemption "" ) . \nthere is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . \nhedaya was superb in "" clueless , "" same for david paymer in "" get shorty , "" harris yulin in "" ghostbusters "" and liev schreiber in "" the daytrippers .

"b'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , "" all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies !

"b""back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . \nhe couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . \nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . \nthe hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . \nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . \nsurviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . \nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . \nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . \nwell , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . \nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . \nwe know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . \nin the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . \nduring the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . \nthat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . \nthe photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . \n""",0
"b'when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn\'t expect much from it . \nmy snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . \nbut all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . \nit turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . \nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . \nat the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . \na year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . \ncole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood . \nweird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn\'t moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn\'t-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . \nhe steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . \nthe trailer gave away the movie\'s first major plot twist . \nif it hadn\'t , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn\'t know what\'s wrong with cole . \nif you\'re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense .

"b""perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . \ni really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . \nmy problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . \nin addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . \nthe only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . \nhowever , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . \nneedless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . \ni can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . \ni can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . \nit's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . \nout of sight proves that it doesn't . \ni had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . \nafter seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . \nhere , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . \nhe does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . \nhe goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . \nwe're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . \nfortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . \nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . \nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . \nat first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . \nit's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . \ni've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . \nhe's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . \nhe uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . \nas i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . \nlopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . \ni can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . \nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . \nthe brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . \nthe scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . \nthe supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . \ndennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . \nsteve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . \nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . \nout of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . \noverall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . \nnot every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . \nas for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . \n""",1
"b'1989\'s "" major league "" was a delightful surprise . \ni didn\'t expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny . \nhowever , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale . \nthat\'s certainly true of "" major league ii "" and the most recent entry , "" major league : back to the minors .

"b""fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . \nthe film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . \nsome shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . \nand what's more , this beast is heading for new york . \ngulp ! \nalthough godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . \nthe main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies . \nbroderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image . \nwhile emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . \nalso , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . \nshe's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap . \nit's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . \nshame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . \nhank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . \nalso making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . \no . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . \nbut what about the script ? \nwell , that's not up to par either . \nemmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . \nthe dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , \nbroderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) \nalso , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . \nthe jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . \n ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! \nha ha ha ha ! . ) \nthe plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e . \nvelicorapters ) running around new york . \nright , so the script and acting suck . \nbut what about the special effects ? \nthankfully , they're are quite good . \ngodzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . \nthe destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . \nbut although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . \nthe movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending . \nand of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . \nlet's just hope one never arrives . \n""",0
"b'being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , "" shall we dance "" won\'t be seen by that many people . \nand that\'s a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences . \nthe surprising thing about "" shall we dance "" is the universal appeal of the story . \na us version is in the works , and it\'s no wonder - it\'s not really all that culture specific . \nalthough there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn\'t at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film . \nthe only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you\'ll know why ) . \na middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn\'t translate into a fulfilled life . \nafter glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself . \nafter finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her . \nwe then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class . \nlater on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co-worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film . \nthe story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along . \nit\'s a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances . \nit\'s difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater . \nit\'s one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil . \njust a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you . \nwhen was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ? \n "" shall we dance "" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste . \n'",1
"b'in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . \neach of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax . \nin magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . \nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent . \nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . \neach story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . \nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . \nthen toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . \nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \nthis creates some strange effects . \nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \npartridge\'s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . \nfrank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women\'s lib . \nofficer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . \njimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children\'s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . \nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . \neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . \nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . \nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson\'s company . \njohn c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . \nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . \nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . \nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following . \nas well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . \nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . \nand in actual fact , it does . \nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . \nit is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . \nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds . \nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . \nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . \nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . \nwhen the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . \nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . \nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . \nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . \n ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) \notherwise the event was quite believable . \nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . \nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \n "" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . "" \nhowever a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . \nnote that the previous verse says "" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , "" \nso the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . \nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 . \n'",1
"b""forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n""",0
"b""with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don't end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \n""",1

"b'many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . \nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . \nbut little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . \nwalking out of the theater , i could see the audience\'s disgust . . . \none member even had to be awakened after the film ended . \ndon\'t believe the previews that you see . . . \nthis is definitely not a film for everyone . \nthis is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . \nkids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . \nthe plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . \nit goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . \nthink of the film city of angels . \nnow add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . \nboth films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . \ncosting around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it\'s money back . \nbut due to it\'s story , i doubt it will . \nfor everyone who thought titanic\'s story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . \nbut don\'t get me wrong . . . \ni hope the film does do well . \nit\'s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . \ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . \nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . \nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city . \nfull of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . \nbut don\'t do that , because you\'ll end up going to hell . \nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . \nchris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . \nannie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . \nannie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . \nchris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . \nthey also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . \nbut one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . \nshe tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . \nchris copes with the problem by realizing they aren\'t around anymore , and nothing will change that . \njust as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . \nchris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . \nguided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . \nthat is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . \nprior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . \nchris decides to leave her alone . \nlittle does he realize what will happen next . \ni\'m not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . \ncertainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . \nstory is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . \nhowever , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . \na couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . \n "" we\'re soul mates ! "" \nchris exclaims . \nheaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . \nusually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . \nbut what dreams may come goes a different route . \nit shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . \nchris\' heaven is his memories brought to life . \nhis thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven . \n "" i\'ve never seen anyone use real paint before , "" albert says . \nequally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone . \ninstead , it\'s a state of being . \nin one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his "" tracker "" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . \nthousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else . \nmostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood . \nit\'s truly a frightening sequence . \nproduction designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination . \nusing state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration . \nsometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact . \nit\'s not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . \ncostume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . \ncinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects . \nbut serra\'s entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . \nwriter ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . \nthe story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . \nand director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . \nwhat dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . \nyour average movie goer more than likely isn\'t used to expressionistic techniques . \nthe film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn\'t take it too far . \nit is , after all , just a movie . \nrobin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . \nhis comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn\'t quite as effective . \nbut drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . \nit\'s doubtful he\'ll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn\'t really mind if he did . \nthe real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . \nthis may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . \nit\'s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . \nhowever , the academy doesn\'t like to award performances for these types of films . \ncuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he\'s certainly not distracting . \nmax von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . \na treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris\' father lost in the sea of faces . \nit\'s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . \noverall , it\'s williams and sciorra\'s film . \nwhat dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . \nthe film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . \nsome will find the plot distracting . \nsome will find the visuals absolutely glorious . \nand some will find both . \nthe only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . \nby the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( "" what "" becomes "" wet "" and you should understand ) . \nin actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet . \njust thought i should let you know . \n'",1
"b""it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \nthe thrills all came from the plot . \nronin is like a film made by another man . \nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . \nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \nthe story is not very easy to follow . \nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \none wonders what they saw in the script . \nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \n""",0
"b""the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there . \nas the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts . \nif only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently . \njoe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas . \nhe's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender . \nmary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid . \nthe bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . \nas the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path . \nwhere exactly does all this go ? \nthat's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself . \nhis meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac . \nand another . \nand another . \nat one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth . \nthat is most certainly the case here . \njoe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself . \nunhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied . \nif there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all . \nthe real blonde is not without some amusements . \nit does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) . \nbut on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside . \n ( opens february 27 ) \n""",0
"b'in this year\'s summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as "" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would .

"b""kevin smith is like a big kid . \nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . \nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . \nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \nthat is not to say smith's message is a bad one . \nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . \nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . \nsmith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \nbut this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . \nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \nthe film's humor is uneven . \nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \nbut many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . \nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . \nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \n""",1
"b""8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . \n""",0

"b' "" spawn "" may be somewhat of an older film . \nin fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn\'t seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . \nbut i managed to catch it before it made it\'s way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . \nit wasn\'t the worst film of year by any means . \nit isn\'t even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . \nbut it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my "" worst of 1997 "" list . \nthe only reason it doesn\'t come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year . \nperformances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy . \nin fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! \neven the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . \ni don\'t know how to explain that one ; it wasn\'t exactly choppy , but something about it seemed . \n . \n . \nwell , annoyingly unprofessional . \njohn leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite . \nhe is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional . \nbut the main problem i found with "" spawn "" , as with most films that wind up on my "" worst of "" lists , is that it was just plain boring . \ni wouldn\'t even say there was a climax to the film . \nsure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion . \nnever too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way . \neven though it\'s one of the shorter movies i\'ve seen this year , it\'s one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . \nlike i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small . \ni was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn\'t allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . \nand batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn\'s outfit created . \nbut even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game . \nwho knows if "" spawn : the video game "" wasn\'t part of the plan from the beginning ? \nkeeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all . \nbut none of this movie\'s saving graces can it make it something i\'d recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission . \nthis movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn\'t really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing . \nif you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be ! \ntrust me ! \n "" spawn "" has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers ! \n'",0
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \nas boogie nights opens , he\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star "" . \nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \nit\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \nwhile much of the film\'s humour pertains to the characters\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \'freaky deaky\' with the music -- it\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\'s personal collection ) , there\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \nit\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \nafter the debacle with 1996\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \njack horner\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\'s retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\'s "" it\'s not about the little details , it\'s about the big picture ! "" \nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \'artistic\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i\'ve ever done "" , it\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\'s no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" \nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\'s finest exchanges . \nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \nstill , even if he doesn\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \nin any case , it\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\'s "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \nif this scene already wasn\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\'s seat , sobbing "" i\'m so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \ni\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \nconsequently , it\'s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she\'s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she\'s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham\'s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \ndraw your own conclusions . \nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \nluis guzman\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\'s carlito\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\'s a hanger-on to jack\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \njack\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\' biggest comic payoffs . \nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there\'s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \n'",1
"b'one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . \nsuch was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . \nmade in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan . \nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . \nbut , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . \nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . \ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . \nduring one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . \nafter she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh\'s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . \nshe is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . \napart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn\'t got anything in common with the works of director\'s more talented father . \ndespite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . \njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . \nthe actors aren\'t good either . \njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn\'t suit him . \nbill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena\'s boyfriend . \nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn\'t help this film . \nthe screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer\'s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . \none of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh\'s "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . \nthe twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . \nall in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger\'s career . \n'",0
"b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that "" this is the story of daryl gleason "" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the "" stalked "" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\'s intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n'",0

"b'ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood \nsynopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . \nin the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham\'s snobbish adopted daughter , estella . \nthe gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class "" gentleman .

"b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \ni didn\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \nfor those of you who don\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , "" a graduate of several 12-step programs . "" \nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \nstuart\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \nthen , disaster strikes . \nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \nalthough smalley\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called "" serious dramas "" of today . \nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \nyou\'ll laugh . . . you\'ll \ncry . . . . it\'s \nall there . \n'",1
"b' "" love to kill "" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who\'s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza\'s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman\'s sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don\'t really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn\'t , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it\'s a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere\'s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who\'s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who\'s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza\'s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it\'s not exactly a linear storyline . \n "" love to kill "" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it\'s just too bad that the story doesn\'t really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n'",0
"b""what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \nit just depends on one's point of view . \nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \nall that separates them is war . \nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \naside from that , malick's direction is stunning . \nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \nultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \n""",1
"b'if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild . \nyet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen . \nmansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties . \nten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) \nspending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times . \nfanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . ) \nwriter/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes . \nfrom a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film\'s audience appeal . \nwhat ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen\'s own personality by including excerpts from the author\'s journals , giving that dialogue to fanny . \nthe result is a central character that is immediately appealing . \nas the grown fanny , australian actress frances o\'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work . \nat times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel\'s more introspective observations . \nthis is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o\'connor\'s credit that it works as well as it does . \nthe central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . . \nwhether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? \nfanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well . \nhis attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny . \nwhile mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film\'s appropriately austen-like ending . \nother thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . . \nthe slave trade . \nthere is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten . \nthe motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust . \nfanny\'s cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy . \nfanny\'s own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she "" married for love .

"b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\'s notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he\'s also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\'s the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\'s office . \ni don\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , \nalthough it wouldn\'t surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\'s acting ability . \nalmost every time he\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\'s reality . \nwe\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n'",1

"" \nscream 2\'s story is very similar to it\'s predecessor\'s . \nsidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . \ngale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . \nat the premiere of stab , two students from sidney\'s college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . \nthe press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . \nthey want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . \nthe most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . \nthe rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . \nthe other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . \nthe audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . \n ( whew . ) \nthe movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . \neven better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that\'s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . \nthe just add to the fun of watching it . \ni recommend it for other reasons as well . \nwhat i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . \nno werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . \nit is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . \nno extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . \nthe down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say "" it\'s just a movie . "" \nthe whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . \nthey are likeable , but not outstanding . \nbut in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . \nit was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . \nthe internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i\'ll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . \nif craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i\'ll be happy to mark my calendar . \n'",1
"b""an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material . \nthe story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . \ninstead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . \nupon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days . \nof course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries . \nin what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . \nrosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . \ni can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . \nbut maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . \nganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . \nthroughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character . \nthe gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . \ndirector and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor . \nthe cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job . \nthe reason ? \nmimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . \nthe novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . \nunfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . \nrosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . \nit's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . \nseveral details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . \nearly in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . \nafter that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past . \nit seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any . \nbut there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips . \nthe movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . . \nor if our passports weren't missing . \n""",1

"b'romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . \nwith director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . \nthose mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . \ncall me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don\'t seem to mix well . \ngary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . \nhis cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn\'t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . \njack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . \nwhen he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . \ngary oldman\'s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . \nin the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . \ndemarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . \nthis character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can\'t remember seeing a character quite like her . \nafter being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . \nwhat a woman ! \nlena olin\'s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . \nanabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo\'s wife . \nthere is little insight into her character . \nshe\'s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . \njuliette lewis , as romeo\'s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis\' portrayal certainly didn\'t improve it . \nboth women were anything but sexy or attractive . \npoorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . \nit is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . \nfor example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . \nfine . \njack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . \nfine . \nwhat does jack proceed to do ? \nhe brushes his friends off by telling them he isn\'t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . \nwhy ? \nthe boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack\'s toes by the gravesite . \ni guess they weren\'t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . \nor here\'s another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . \nshe proceeded to set the place on fire . \nwouldn\'t the flames burn off the fingerprints ? \naren\'t dental records more important ? \nas bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn\'t she come up with a better plot ? \n ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) \nlack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . \nthis film doesn\'t even add up the large details . \nthere is little or no consistency in the story-line . \nnot much makes sense . \nthe direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . \nthe moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . \nso while it certainly isn\'t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn\'t diva . \nthere\'s plenty more to tear apart in this film . \nmy advice to someone who hasn\'t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . \nthere are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . \nit\'s not a boring film , just not a good one . \nor an intelligent one . \n'",0

the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . \nit is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . \nbut no one has arrived yet . \nher 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . \nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . \nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . \nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues . \nit is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . \nfirst there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . \nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . \nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \nval is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . \nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . \nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \nbut it didn't happen that way . \nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . \n""",0
"b""i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . \nfor the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . \ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . \nas a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . \nit reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . \nit's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . \nunfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . \nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . \nbut it sure is a fascinating failure . \nmarky . \n . \n . \ner , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . \nhe's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . \nhe works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . \nthey're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . \nthey all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . \nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . \nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . \nwhen they do this , it turns out she is paris' . \n . \n . \ngoddaughter ! \nit's very bad to have paris against you . \nthe story is standard action film stuff . \nit's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \nit's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \nlike i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . \nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . \nand since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \nthey're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . \nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \nit's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \n""",0

"b'when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . \nnow , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster\'s involvement in the project , i thought "" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? "" . \nas it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . \nrobert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . \ndon\'t get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . \nbased on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . \nallie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . \nshe spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . \nher passion for `long-distance communication\' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . \na scene which particularly strengthens the audiences\' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied "" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now "" . \nallie\'s research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . \nher work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer\'s money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . \nundaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers\' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . \nthe following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . \nthe news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . \nthe situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . \nas the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . \nshe enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . \nher eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president\'s spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . \nat this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president\'s spiritual advisor . \na strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . \nfrom the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . \nthe meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . \nmany people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . \nzemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . \ncontact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . \ni consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . \n'",1
"b'gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . \nin fact , they\'ve been around in books and on film for many , many years . \nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \n "" the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \nit\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \nthe film ultimately shouldn\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\'s future . \nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \nwhen annie\'s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \n "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\'s "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches . \nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\'s "" the talented mr . ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \nblanchett isn\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\'s "" boys don\'t cry , "" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\'s "" the watcher "" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\'s "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\'s "" wonder boys "" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\'s "" hollow man "" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\'s spicy best friend , linda . \nthe other notable aspect of "" the gift "" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\'s almost suffocating . \nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , "" the gift "" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . \nit may not be

"b'call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \nin gridlock\'d , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \nshakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \nwhen a new year\'s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \nthey soon make a new year\'s resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \nin order for you to buy into gridlock\'d at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year\'s day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \ngridlock\'d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991\'s falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \nin falling down , michael douglas\' d-fens ( the character\'s personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock\'d by the drug lord d-reper\'s plates ) whips out a gun because he can\'t get breakfast at mcdonald\'s ; in gridlock\'d , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ?

"b'john sayles\' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . \nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . \nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . \nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . \nhowever , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . \nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . \nthe film\'s main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . \none of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . \nfuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . \nwith government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . \nthis program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . \nhowever , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn\'t . "" \nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . \nnext , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . \nthrough his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . \nalong the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . \nas domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . \nlast , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn\'t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . \nsayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns . "" \n ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) \nhe creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . \ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film\'s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo\'s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn\'t ) . \nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . \nsayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in "" matewan "" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in "" lone star "" ( 1996 ) . \nsayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( "" gattaca "" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . \nsayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . \nthe one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . \nit would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film . \nin fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . \nin addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo\'s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . \nnevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . \nthe last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , "" nobody refuses the men with guns .

"b""it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . \nthe crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . \none half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . \nthe other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . \nthe police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . \nat the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . \nthat's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . \ndeceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . \nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \nit's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . \nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \npolice procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . \nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . \nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \nas wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . \nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . \nboth play their characters like familiar types . \npenn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . \nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \nrenee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . \none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \nplot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . \nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \n""",1
"b""be warned . . \nbrit love story in the offing . \neffeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite . \nhe is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making . \nthe ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school . \nthey do not see each other for another eighteen yeas . \nin that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music . \nkarl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company . \nchance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about . \nif at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo . . . , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat . \nkim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much . . . \na new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy . \npersonally , give me those cheap laughs any day . \ni'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story . \ndifferent for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it . \nby refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself . \nlightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple . \nbut this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like . \nprentice does though , and that's never explained . \nbut then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up . \nif oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either . \nsnide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance . \nmisogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance . \nthe couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment . \nkim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition ) . \nand best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion . \nawwww . \nterrific closure . \nhappy ending . \nbut just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ? \nif you figure that one out , let me know . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n""",0
"b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \nthe movie\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" . \na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\'t funny , nor believable . \nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \nif you can\'t , don\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \n'",0

"b'even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . \nlike everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . \nconsequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf\'s tribe . \nlet me start out by saying that krippendorf\'s tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that\'s about its only asset . \nthe best word to describe this film is "" asinine . "" \nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . \nkrippendorf\'s tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . \nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . \nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . \nfinally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . \nonce upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . \nhe and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . \nshortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf\'s wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . \nnow , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . \nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu "" . \nto provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . \nsoon , much to krippendorf\'s surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . \nbut one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . \nthe only way krippendorf\'s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . \nunfortunately , it\'s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . \ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . \nmeanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . \nthe acting in underwhelming . \ndreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf . \nalongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv\'s dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . \nthis quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . \nno one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen\'s daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . \ni know that a movie\'s in trouble when it\'s half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . \nmost of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . \nif there\'s any upside , it\'s that i don\'t see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . \nkrippendorf\'s tribe will quickly become extinct . \n'",0
"b'quiz show , an almost perfectly accurate true story , is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid-50\'s , "" twenty-one "" . \non this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on . \nthe game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . \nbut , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . \nquiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . \nstempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . \nand your jewish man raising a family . \nstempel has been the reigning champion on "" twenty-one "" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . \nin his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . \nalthough , in the mind of the show\'s producers , herbie stempel is getting old . \ndan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a "" jewish guy from queens with bad teeth "" and that the kids need someone better to look up to . \ntherefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . \nsomeone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . \nenter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . \nvan doren had decided to try out for the game show "" tic tac dough "" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . \nbut when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright\'s assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the "" twenty-one "" kingdom . \nvan doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . \nafter stempel loses the "" throne "" to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . \nmeanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on "" twenty-one "" to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . \nhis investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . \nquiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford\'s direction is especially superb . \nthe performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . \nquiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . \ndefinitely a film you should not miss . \n'",1
"b""possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk . \nit smashed u . s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here . \nbut is it any good ? \nin a word , no . \ni'll elaborate further . \nthe story is as follows . \napparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on . \none where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened . \n ( see jurrasic park . ) \nimgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago . \nrealizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island . \nenter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there . \nso , basically , what you have is this . \ntwo teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them . \na fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem . \nit's crap . \nover two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky . \nadd to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested . \nit becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? ' \n ( yes , you should ) . \nit's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park . \nwith only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c . g . i \ndinosaurs ( the t . rex's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world . \na very dissapointing sequel , indeed . \n""",0
"b'play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie . \ncontaining a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can\'t jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two . \nrocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . . \nsomething that he has not yet successfully achieved . \nrocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince\'s ex-girlfriend , grace . \nboth men are nearing the end of their "" almost "" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity . \nwhen both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement . \nour boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight . \nthe film is divided into two sections . \nat first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace\'s "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day . \nalong the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by . \nonce in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar . \nboth mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we\'d know it from their work here . \nmr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince . \nthe christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable . \nmr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar . \nweak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance . \nthe other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another . \ntom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can\'t make her mind up which boxer she prefers . \nbecause of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins . \nbut even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other . \nwriter/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed . \nif only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film . \nas it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable . \nthe title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film . \nthe phrase , "" play it to the bone\' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you\'ve achieved your desired goal . \nthat is a biblical principle . \n "" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? \nso run , that ye may obtain . "" \n1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv] \nachieving anything worthy in life requires "" playing it to the bone "" . \nwe need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives . \nthis is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . \nas a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time . \nbut as a principle of life , the phrase "" play it to the bone "" are words to live by . \n'",0
"b""you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it . \nprobably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . \nhowever , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . \ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . \none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . \nmaggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . \nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \nthe next scene is brilliant . \nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \nlucas is filled with great performances . \nforget everything you know about corey haim . \nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . \nit deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . \n""",1
"b'some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\'s a cartoon . \nbut it\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn\'t just business , it\'s a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . "" \n "" let\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . "" \n "" ok , that\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "" \n "" what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where\'s the zaniness ? \ni don\'t see zany here . \nif you can\'t make it zany , cut it ! "" \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor . \noteri\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\'t poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\'-and-jivin\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let\'s face it , it\'s pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe "" evil sidekick support group "" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\'s onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n'",0
"b'there seem to be two reactions to dark city . \nyou either love it or you are unimpressed . \ncount me as a "" love it . "" \nas good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . \nwhere the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . \nit has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . \nnot clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . \na man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . \nsurprised , the attacker runs off . \nthe dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman\'s body in the room . \na mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he\'s leaving or what he\'s fleeing . \nghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . \nan odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . \nthe amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . \nnow if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . \ndark city is good on many levels . \nfirst , the look of the movie is excellent . \ngive credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . \nthere are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . \nit is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper\'s painting , nighthawks . \nproyas\' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film\'s world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . \nthe look is like a cross between tim burton\'s batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . \nsecond , the editing of the film is good . \nthe pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments . \nalso , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . \nthird , the special effects are well used . \nthey look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . \none example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . \na simple ripple effect is used . \na more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . \nrestraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . \nfinally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . \nunlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . \njohn murdoch\'s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . \nhis struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . \nwhen we finally see the big picture of the movie\'s world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . \na few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . \n'",1
"b""i've got to admit it . . . \ni'm a huge jim carrey fan . \ni loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . \nuntil i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . \nsadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . \ncarrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . \nthe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) . \nsoon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other . \nonce again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills . \nthose who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original . \nthe original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny . \nhere , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise . \ninstead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly . \nbut one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself . \nin the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach . \nbut here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style . \nthere are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between . \nthey are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber . \n""",0
"b'a follow-up to disney\'s live-action "" 101 dalmatians "" that\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith "" 102 dalmatians , "" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996\'s "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\'s laborious film . \nwhat makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\'t even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\'s split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\'s in "" men of honor . "" \njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \nfrance\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in "" 102 dalmatians "" the producers milk that realization for all it\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as "" poopies , "" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \nthat done , it\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\'s pretty much all they are . \nthere\'s always the feeling that there\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \nsavvy holiday goers should skip "" 102 dalmatians "" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \nit\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \n'",0
"b'house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . \ndirected by william malone , written by dick beebe , \n "" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . \none doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . \na nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . \nthese mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . \nexcept this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . \nin past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . \n "" house on haunted hill "" doesn\'t want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . \nthis nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . \n "" house on haunted hill "" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . \nthe film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . \nthe aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . \nhowever , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . \nthe plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . \neach character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . \nsince the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . \nthe problem is that every character is not likable . \nthe two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . \nthe characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . \nthe worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan\'s watson pritchett . \nhe spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . \nwaiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . \nthe most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . \nplaying the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . \nhowever , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . \nthe main problem is that "" house on haunted hill "" is not scary . \nto top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . \nif the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to "" deep blue sea "" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed . \n'",0
"b""my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . \nthis is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . \nthe movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . \nwilliam haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . \nthere is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . \nhe finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . \nthis movie was exceptional for many reasons . \none being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . \nthey worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i'll let you fiqure which is which ) . \nalso , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . \nit seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . \nexperience counts for a lot ! ! \n""",1
"b'do film critics have morals ? \nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? \nnaturally we don\'t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . \nsecondly , and along the same line , we can\'t prejudge a film because of it\'s stars , director , etc . the difference ? \nwell , in the first one , we\'d go into a film thinking it\'s going to be dumb or it\'s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i\'m not expecting much ) . \non the second hand , we\'re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it\'s made by disney ? \noh , it\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\'s in it ? \nit\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \ncan\'t be that good ) . \nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \nmake sense ? \nok , but what about comparing ? \nisn\'t that kind of along the same lines ? \nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composer\'s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? \nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \ni think it is , and i\'ll tell you why . \na good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \nsometimes that can be tough . \n "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! \nit was sooooo cheezy ! "" \nmight be used to describe a film . \nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \nbut which is more important ? \nand which is better ? \nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \nevery average person out there who\'s interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" \nand so , as a critic , i\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \njackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \ntarantino\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \n ( we\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\'d hope , he posts jackie\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \nordell won\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \ncoming into play is another 70\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \nmax\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \nalso involved is ordell\'s "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\'t need a de niro to play him . \ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\'t as awesome as the first time . \njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\'t think he\'s quite as irreplaceable . \nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \njackson could\'ve remained tarantino\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \nthis is grier\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\'s novel "" rum punch "" . \nfor those movie-goers , don\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\'s film- making . \nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\'t pulp fiction at all . \nit\'s good , but it isn\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\'t satiate true fans . \nif you can realize that this isn\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \n'",1
"b' "" when will the devil take me ? "" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . \nthe spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . \nmartha fiennes\' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it\'s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . \nwhen we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle\'s estate . \nwith plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . \nsmitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga\'s fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga\'s sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he\'s a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . \nin one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . \nhe is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . \nsoon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . \nwhen we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . \nthis time , onegin finds her irresistable . \nwhat is most amazing about ralph fiennes\' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . \noverwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . \nthe actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there\'s room to breathe in a role that\'s made up of shades of gray like "" onegin "" . \npetula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "" parking lot "" : "" you don\'t know what you\'ve got ? til it\'s gone . "" \nonegin\'s about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . \nwhat the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . \nout of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . \ntatyana\'s emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . \nshe changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . \ntyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . \nthey both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . \n_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of "" masterpiece theater "" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . \nan mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . \nthe film has an atypical period look , as well . \nabsent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . \nthe sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . \n ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i\'m reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) \nmartha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of "" yevgeny onegin "" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin\'s difficult text yet . \nms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion . \n'",1
"b'it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \nit abounds with high production values : john toll\'s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick\'s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \nbut this does not save a misguided script . \nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer\'s only response to his "" heroism "" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \nbut wallace\'s actions paint a different story . \nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \nthis is evident of a "" spartacus complex "" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \nhorner\'s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film\'s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \n'",0
"b' "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . \nevery forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . \nit starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . \nbut then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon "" . \nforty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . \nby the time it\'s over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . \nthe main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . \nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you\'re looking for a good time . \nrichard\'s voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . \nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . \nhe checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . \nhe seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . \nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . \nmoreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . \ncaptivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . \nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard\'s . \nonce they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard\'s growing desire for francoise . \nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . \netienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . \nit\'s odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . \nand once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . \nfor example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . \nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . \nthere are several ideas that are introduced in "" the beach "" and each one could merit its own feature-length film . \nthere\'s the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . \nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . \ndicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . \nconsequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . \n'",0
"b'the great actor james woods once said ( and i\'m paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn\'t messy , then you\'re not doing it right "" . \na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" ) . \nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can\'t scare your audience , gross em\' out , if you can\'t do that , make em\' laugh "" . \nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \nit seems that audiences\' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don\'t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \nthese flicks aren\'t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend\'s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it\'s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \nit\'s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \nit\'s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn\'t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man\'s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \nthe film\'s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they\'re coming from inside the house ) . \ni won\'t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \nsad to say , it doesn\'t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \nnow that would be scary . \nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i\'ve ever spent an evening with . \nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can\'t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can\'t stand not getting slaughtered . \n'",0

"" \ni despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights . \ni hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain . \ni hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it\'s about brooklyn where this film takes place ) . \nand i hate how he\'s so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) . \nsure , the guy\'s probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) . \nbut the guy makes worse films than reagan did . \nso what\'s the plot of this shit-terpiece ? \nwell . . . something \nabout him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight . \ni couldn\'t believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) . \nand forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off . \ni\'m sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one\'s self ? \nso in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy . \nand i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film . \nbut noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe\'s family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) . \nand forsythe more than once threatens his family . \nat one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in "" the shining "" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) . \nseagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee . \nhe even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of "" catch , "" when he\'s conveniently called away on assignment . \ni dunno about you , but playing "" catch "" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares . \nhe also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he\'s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue . \nserves them right . \nthis film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don\'t appear to be in this film . \ni already mentioned gina gershon ( who\'s pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly . \ni know this guy can act : he was awesome in "" raising arizona "" as goodman\'s partner in crime . \nbut he\'s just awful here . \njerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down . \nwhy is he the only one who gives a good performance ? \nwell , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility . \nhe seems to be in here just to give it a cool "" law and order "" feeling ( even if it\'s not a "" cool "" feeling ) . \nand in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as "" terry malloy , "" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey . \noh ! \nand "" er "" \'s julliana margiulles has two scenes . \n "" out for justice "" just proves once again that american action films just suck . \ni know that there\'s such a good thing as good action - he\'s called john woo . \nbut if you\'re in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don\'t bother watching this . \nit\'s so stupid that it\'s boring . \n'",0
"b' "" gordy "" is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long "" sesame street "" skit , and a very bad one at that . \nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that it\'s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . \ni\'m sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . \nit is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to "" up north , "" which we know means death . \nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . \nactually , it\'s almost funny in a way . \nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . \njinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . \nwhat is the point of this ? \nmaybe she is one of the producer\'s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . \nwe then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . \nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn\'t see that one coming ! ) , \nstarts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . \nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank\'s grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . \nand gordy ! \nof course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn\'t that evil . \nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . \nit\'s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker\'s are just this untalented and stupid . \nat times "" gordy "" is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded "" z- .

"b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \nmartin scorsese\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \nthe movie\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\'t sleep at nights . \nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\'s presidential campaign . \ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \nwhile de niro\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" . \nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \nmatthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly "" liberated "" betsy . \neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless "" messages "" that cover the lack of any serious program can\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \nnow , more than two decades later , when some other "" life imitating art "" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \n'",1
"b""in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \nshe is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' . \nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \n""",1
"b""written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) \ndirected by robert altman \nsome time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . \nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \nthe director ? \nfrancis ford coppola . \nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \ndepends on whom you ask . \nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \nyou be the judge . \nbut back to the picture at hand . \nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \n""",1
"b'countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . \nluckily , movie reviewers aren\'t burdened with such legislation . \notherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . \nin case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . \nin any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . \nthose who don\'t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . \nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . \nlike so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . \nperhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . \nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . \nanyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . \nand it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas\' epic . \nstar wars wasn\'t just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . \nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . \nuntil than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies . \nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy . \none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\'t like it . \nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s . \ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \nboth movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \nin a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \nbut unlike many "" personal "" movies of the era , its "" personality "" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \nthe plot , set "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away "" , begins in a time of civil war . \nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \ncritics who don\'t like the movie , especially those who can\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of "" new hollywood "" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \nthe others would find the author\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \ngeorge lucas\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \nwe have a "" coming-of-age "" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \nunfortunately , the same can\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\' superiority over kubrick . \nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \nthat honour should definitely go to the "" oscar "" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \n'",1
"b'as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa . \nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \nfor those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \ndon\'t miss it . \n'",1

"b""i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . \n ( huh ? ) \nwell , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . \nhe and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . \nagainst his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . \nthe rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? \na simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . \noh , and its much better than any of those . \nsam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . \nhe really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . \ni think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . \none of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . \nin malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . \nit seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . \nsure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . \nraimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . \ni think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . \nand then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . \nif it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . \nhe gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . \nit is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . \njacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . \ni wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . \nhere he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . \nthough the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . \npaxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . \nperhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture . \na simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . \nbut at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . \n""",1
"b""the happy bastard's quick movie review \nthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . \nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . \nsadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . \nsince the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . \nthe story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . \nhis popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . \nthen , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . \nthese two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . \nforward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . \nhowever , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . \nwith the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . \nof course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . \nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . \nfinally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . \nthe main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . \nin fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . \nbut that's just it- scenes . \nthere's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . \ni mean , was this really necessary ? \ncouldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? \ni mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? \nparticularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? \nthat really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . \nthe acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . \nstill , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? \nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . \n""",0
"b'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original "" a soldier\'s story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\'s . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , "" in the heat of the night "" and the even better "" in cold blood .

"b'it\'s amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . \ntake adam sandler . \non the basis of his first two cds ( "" they\'re all gonna laugh at you !

"b'not since oliver stone\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\'t ask-- you\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\'t feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don\'t talk about fight club .

"b'i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . \nthe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \nit\'s a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors\' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there\'s no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \nhow did i know ? \nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\'s never explained . \nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\'s events . \nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" \nooh . \nspooky . \nthe team goes back to jeffrey\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \nwacky hijinks ensue . \ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \nnevermind . ) \nthis movie was awful . \nsimply awful . \nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \nbecause she\'s pregnant ! \nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he\'s straight out of "" deliverance "" ! \nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \nit didn\'t work . \non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \n ( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \nlet\'s get on a plane home . "" \n "" no . \ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what\'s going on . "" \n "" ok . "" ) \nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \ni also felt that there was simply too much blood \'n\' gore in this film . \nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey\'s throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \nthis movie didn\'t stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster , "" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director\'s intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \nhm ? ) \nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \nfrom the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . \n'",0
"b""i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit's one of mrs . \ndoubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit's easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . \nthere's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n""",1

"b""blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n""",1
"b'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \nthough it doesn\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \nthis film\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \nstormare played the "" really , really evil guy "" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \nhis performance is very chilling . \n8 mm\'s success may hardly be surprising . \nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\'s eyes . \n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \nwelles is searching for answers . \nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \nhe just enjoys it . \nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \nhe discovers , for example , the victim\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \nif you\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \n'",1

"b'based on the boris karloff\'s classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . \nrecap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it\'s a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it\'s a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep\'s entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there\'s the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you\'d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it\'s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . \non the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . \nbut i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn \nthe sound down ! \nwhile a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you\'re not careful ) . \nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn\'t make anything out . \n'",1
"b""okay , okay . \nmaybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . \nhowewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . \nboy , was i wrong ! \nin the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . \nby the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . \nnot once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . \nof course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . \nin these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . \noh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . \ni have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . \noften , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . \nhow many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? \ntoo many . \ni was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . \nsimply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . \nmy recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . \nyou'll be looking at it for most of the movie . \nmy . \nrent die hard . \nread a book . \nstare at the sky . \ndo not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . \nthe real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . \nthey probably like wrestling too : - ) . \n""",0
"b'conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children\'s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made . \nthat\'s when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . \ncheck out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you\'ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . \nthere\'s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen . \nboomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time . \nthey\'d like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore . \nhollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them . \ndirectors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time . \nand for the most part they\'re messing it up . \n "" mission impossible "" , "" lost in space "" , "" godzilla "" , "" zorro "" . \nnone of these successfully capture the originals . \nnone of these are even good films . \nyou can now add "" the avengers "" to the list . \nthe british television series began in 1961 . \nsuper secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for . \nsurrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times . \nthe leather-clad rigg probably didn\'t hurt the ratings either . \nafter all it\'s not a coincidence that you can\'t pronounce her character\'s name without "" appeal "" . \nnow we\'re in the nineties . \nsteed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england\'s weather . \nthat\'s about as much of a plot as we have . \nthere\'s some footage about a lot of other things that either don\'t make sense or make even less sense . \nwe get betrayal for some unknown reason . \nevil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film . \nremarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason . \nthere\'s a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone\'s in it . \nthe spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind . . . at \nleast in some scenes . \nthere\'s probably a reason for all of this , but we\'ll never know it . \nmacnee makes an appearance of sorts . \nhe is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing . \na group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits . \nat first it\'s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy . \nthe movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner . \nit feels like major portions of the film are missing . \nthe storyline jumps rather than flows . \nreportedly the film was re-cut several times . \nthis is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing . \nthere\'s one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher . \nother than that , the effects are second-rate . \nthe weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes . \nthurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn\'t work . \nshe looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there\'s no spark . \nfiennes fares even less well . \nmacnee\'s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor . \nfiennes\' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town . \neven connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn\'t have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes . \nthe action scenes are difficult to follow . \ndirector jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of "" diabolique "" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn\'t be . \nthings happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . \nthe primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads . \nwitty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination . \nadmittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there\'s no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever . \none of emma peel\'s first lines of dialog is "" rules are made to be broken . "" \nit doesn\'t get any better . \nadvance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone . \nthe release date was changed several times . \nconnery refuses to promote the film . \nthere was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers . \nat least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out . \nadmittedly i haven\'t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades . \nmy guess is that it would be severely dated now . \nno matter how antiquated it might be , there\'s no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing . \nthere\'s no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie . \nno reason at all . \n'",0
"b""cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \n ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \nthey are likely to be remembered for . \n . \n . \nwell , quite a while . ? \ni like this film , too . ? \nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \nyes , you read that right . \narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \na . j . \nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \n""",1

"" \nnothing more , nothing less . \ndr . kimble of the fugitive didn\'t look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . \nlibby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . \nashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . \nwinning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . \npeople still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . \nthough i don\'t think he will win another oscar again . \nthe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . \neven if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . \nburglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby\'s slipups . \nthe message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you\'re innocent of the major crime . \nhopefully criminals won\'t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . \nthat would just be plain stupid . \n'",0
"b""the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . \nafter attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . \nafter a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . \nagain and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . \nthe characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . \nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . \nthat someone is death . \nyou see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . \nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . \nfor a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . \nalex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . \nin a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . \nafter a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . \nthe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . \nbut death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . \nthe grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . \nbefore i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . \nis that one helluva premise , or what ? \n`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . \non familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . \nunlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . \nyou just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . \nyoung viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . \nafter the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . \nlow and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . \nsome splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . \n`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . \nnot that the characters are that good . \nsawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . \nin addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . \naside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . \nthe personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight !

"b""bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . \nthe screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . \nanyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration . \nthe central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . \nbobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . \na new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . \nafter confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . \nbut first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . \nkit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . \nafter emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . \nthe actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . \nthe unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . \nwhen the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . \nthese include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . \nbowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . \ncertain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . \nno , hilarious . \nstandouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . \nand just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . \nwhile the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . \nmasterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . \nhowever , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . \nthis is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . \nmurphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . \nthese three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . \nsteve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . \nthis is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . \nbut it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . \nthe supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . \nthe only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . \ngraham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . \ni wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough . \n""",1
"b'seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nit\'s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . \nall stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters\' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . \ntherefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . \nit\'s a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . \nthe film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . \nthis plays a major factor in the film\'s success . \nto use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . \nit might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . \ncan a story set so long ago be relatable now ? \nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \nit doesn\'t simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \nwe\'re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o\'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \nhe isn\'t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he\'s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn\'t give her much emotional self-defense . \nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \nhe\'s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he\'s got a bad reputation . \nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \n "" do we have ammunition factories ? \ndo we have food ? \ndo we have a navy ? \nall we have is tobacco . "" \nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\'s wrong . \nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\'s appealing . \nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\'s not going to stop until he has her . \nbut scarlett can\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies . \nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , "" no ! \nnot my leg ! \ndon\'t cut off my leg ! "" \nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\'s ultimate defeat . \nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \nall ? \nnone ? \neither way is possible and it\'s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \nit\'s safe to say most of us won\'t live such overly dramatic lives as those in "" gone with the wind , "" but it\'s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we\'ve just experienced a life\'s worth of joy and pain . \n'",1
"b'ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? \nit\'s full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . \ni felt the same way watching drowning mona . \nskip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . \nthere are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . \nthere is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . \neveryone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . \neven the police chief drives one . \nthere is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . \nthere also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . \nit pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . \nit turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . \nthere are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona\'s tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted . \nstill , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . \nthe lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . \neach scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . \nthere\'s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness . \nanyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . \nthe other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . \neach one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization . \nthere is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . \nmona\'s son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . \nchief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . \nthere\'s nothing more to him . \nelle , the chief\'s daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . \nmona\'s husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . \nbob ( affleck ) , elle\'s betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . \nthere is no contrast to any of the characters . \nby having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld\'s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . \nostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona\'s loving manner with everyone on town . \neven that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . \nit\'s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . \nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it\'s ineptitude . \n'",0

"b'richard linklater\'s "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \nask them what they\'ve been doing lately , and they\'ll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out . "" \nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \n . \n . \n . \nit\'s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo . "" \nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \nthe only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \nthere are only so many times you can hear , "" hey , what\'s going on ? "" \n "" not much , what are you up to ? "" \n "" nothing really , just hanging around , "" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren\'t as weird or unique . \ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \n "" slacker "" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \ni just can\'t help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \n'",1

"" \nhe\'s told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . \nwhen anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . \nthings turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . \nwhile set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today\'s society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . \nthe real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . \nher work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone\'s performance stands up well . \nleigh\'s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she\'s not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character\'s moods in and out of explosive rage . \none can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . \nof the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker\'s performance . \nthere\'s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . \nstill , it cannot be denied that anne meredith\'s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . \nhuston\'s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . \nher sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . \nhuston\'s talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . \nthe film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . \nperhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing . \n'",1

"b""here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? \ndone well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . \nunfortunately , it isn't . \nwith jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . \nfifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . \nhis beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . \nhe wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . \nthis religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . \nat his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . \nmeanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . \nhe has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . \nit is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . \non its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . \nhowever , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . \nand while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . \nif there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . \nthe actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . \nthe nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . \nthe film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . \nthey show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . \nmaybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . \nit certainly would have been more entertaining . \nwide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . \nit starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . \nparents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first . \n""",0
"b'perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with "" . . . this is the fake news , "" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . \nhis shtick was marked by crassness . \nin this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she\'s kicking him out because he\'s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , "" maybe you\'ll feel better after we have some dirty sex . "" \nthis kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can\'t go the distance in a full-length feature . \n "" dirty work "" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . \nemotionally , they\'ve never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . \nalthough having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . \nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . \nmitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam\'s dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . \ntheir idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they\'ll do your dirty work . \nin the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . \ntheir presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . \nby default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . \nexcept for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . \nalready weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs \'broads\' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . \nbut what\'s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . \nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying "" note to self "" ( "" note to self : learn to fight , "" he says after getting beat up ; "" note to self : there\'s always beer , "" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we\'re just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live . \nmuch like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits . \nthe rest of the story is just dead space . \n'",0
"b""i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \ntake the professional , for example . \nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \n""",0
"b' "" ladybugs "" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . \nthis picture doesn\'t play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ? \nand why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? \nrodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . \nhe obviously doesn\'t have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company\'s girls\' soccer team . \nwhat a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . \ni didn\'t laugh , but for some reason it didn\'t annoy me that much . \nchester\'s fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams . \njonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) . \nwhat we get is just another retread of the "" underdog sports team "" mixed with some cross dressing . \nunfortunately , the film isn\'t smart enough to play upon the drag aspect . \nin fact , it downplays it so heavily it\'s totally unbelievable . \ncould it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? \nhe only wears a girl\'s wig , without any makeup , and they don\'t even give him falsies . \nbrandis doesn\'t bother to mimic a girl\'s voice either . \nthen there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ? \nmartha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ? \njust when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . \nwhen bess discovers what\'s really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . \nthis film could\'ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . \nthere\'s just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters . \ni\'ve seen worse movies than "" ladybugs , "" but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn\'t seem as bad as it is . \ndangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price . \n'",0

"" \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\'s ability to choose one\'s own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\'re watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\'s "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\'t ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\'t mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack . \n "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , "" the iron giant "" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which "" the iron giant "" has in spades . \n'",1
"b'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it\'s only when things are over that they make sense . "" \nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you\'re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \nbut don\'t fret , it will surface again . \nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \nbut you hold hope for some time . \nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \nit\'s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \nand with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone\'s interest ? \nto godard\'s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \nwhile i\'ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it\'s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn\'t necessarily an admirable storyteller . \nthe days of breathless are no more . \n'",0
"b'making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . \nwhen it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . \nfor a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original\'s greatness is very rare indeed . \nand whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . \nmore than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off . \nhaving won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . \na series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . \nin doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail . \nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . \nnot "" babe : pig in the city "" . \nthis is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . \nalso , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . \nin essence , it doesn\'t attempt to copy itself . \ninstead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . \nand it succeeds . \nthat\'s not to say the familiar is absent . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\'s soothingly deep narrative . \ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \nand while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . \nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . \nstein\'s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . \nwe also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . \nnot having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . \nso as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won\'t reveal the actor\'s identity here . \nit was a treat indeed to see one of cinema\'s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . \nthe greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction . \nsimply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\'s architectural landmarks . \ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \nadded to that , many of this city\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \nnorma moriceau\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\'s landscape . \nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\'s clown outfit . \nandrew lesnie\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film\'s multiple emotional tones . \nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" . \nreports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . \nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . \nbut even so , to be anything harsher than the original\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . \nby deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating . \nalthough appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" \'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \nwhatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo\'s oil "" ) . \nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \nthe story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\'s purpose in life . \n "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \nbut this film\'s goals aren\'t as lofty as the first\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \nhoggett\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \nbest exemplified in hoggett\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one . \nbut having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . \nas an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . \nsure , it isn\'t a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . \nit is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . \nas a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year\'s best cinematic treats . \n'",1
"b'the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . \nwith she\'s all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . \nhowever , you wouldn\'t know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . \nthis shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . \nthe most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . \nthey have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . \nnow the three surviving girls must decide what to do . \nit takes little time at all for the group\'s leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . \nthe ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique\'s final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . \nto make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . \nthe girls\' cover is surely blown . . . \nnot so fast . \nthinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance . \nafter a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd . \ndoes this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? \nor will this finely honed plan crack over time ? \njawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . \nit manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor . \nit is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn\'t shackled to its dead-weight plot . \nthe film\'s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . \nat this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . \nbut then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . \nthe film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . \nin the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . \nas the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she\'s in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . \nit\'s a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) \njawbreaker doesn\'t quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie . \neither one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . \nthe lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . \nas their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn\'t really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . \n "" detestable "" is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . \nit\'s certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film\'s title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience . \n'",0
"b'after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \'see you soon . \' "" \nof course , it\'s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami\'s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo\'s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere\'s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people\'s lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband\'s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! "" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo\'s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo\'s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit\'s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n'",1
"b'i\'m not really sure what to think about "" crash .

) , also alive . \nthe two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . \nwhen james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . \nyou wouldn\'t think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . \nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . \nin one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean\'s car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . \nsoon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . \nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who\'s main fetish is living on the edge . \ni\'m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don\'t see a connection between car crashes and sex . \nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . \nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we\'re at first not sure if they\'ll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . \nthen when it happens , we hold our breath . \nthe same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . \nthese people are merely taking it to another level . \nthe only problem with the film is that it\'s a tad redundant . \na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . \nthis goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . \nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . \nthere\'s no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it\'s a porn , and we\'re not here to sympathize . \nbut still , they coulda cut it down a bit . \nbut the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . \nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . \nand there are several scenes are just amazing . \none scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . \na sequence involving one character\'s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . \nand the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she\'s wounded . \nthe acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . \nwhile james spader is pretty boring ( he\'s usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . \nshe speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she\'s having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she\'s enjoying it or not . \nin one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . \nholly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . \nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . \nhe often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . \nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he\'s taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he\'s getting a freaky tatoo . \nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . \nkosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in "" teenage mutant ninja turtles "" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he\'s capable of bigger roles . \nwhile i hardly enjoyed "" crash , "" it\'s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . \nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn\'t exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . \ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there\'s also an r-rated version , but i wouldn\'t even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno . \n'",1
"b""it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \n""",1

"b'playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare\'s works . \nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn\'t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \nand , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \nit\'s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \nit could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you\'ve ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it\'s likely that you\'ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \njoseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he\'s a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life\'s more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \nhe\'s commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \nshakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \nhe begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \nthis all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . \nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . \nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeare\'s writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he\'s clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene . \nfiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i\'ve seen her in . \nthe two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \nstoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \ndirector john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \ni\'m going to have to see the movie again ; i\'m certain there are numerous references that i missed . \nin fact , i doubt it\'s possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \nstoppard is a master of detail : you\'ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \nthere\'s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe\'s mysterious death in a pub . \nthere\'s also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \n "" there\'s no dog in this play ? "" \n "" no ! \nno dog ! "" \nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . \ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . \nben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow\'s ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . \ncolin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . \njudi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . \nmy single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . \nthe story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . \nbut my quibbling is not important . \nwhat is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . \nshakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it\'s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . \nit\'s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare\'s work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . \ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . \nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . \n'",1
"b'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\'s fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\'t like federico fellini\'s work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\'t care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\'s fantasies . \nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\'s long-time associate nino rota . \nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n'",1

"b'an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis\' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . \nwhere the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . \nwhere the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . \nin short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . \nthe film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . \nsoon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . \nshe jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . \nserafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . \nhowever , once he learns his would-be girlfriend\'s dark secret , he wishes he hadn\'t . \nshe\'s a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . \nactress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . \nshe imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character\'s fate . \nthis isn\'t necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . \ndelpy\'s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . \ndelpy\'s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski\'s white and richard linklater\'s before sunrise . \nshe was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . \ngiven the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . \nit could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . \nand if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . \nthe rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . \ntom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he\'s in a made-for-tv movie . \nit would be kind to call him bland . \nactors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy\'s friends , are no more impressive . \njulie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . \nand respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal . \non the technical side , it\'s all bad news . \nthe computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal . \nthe creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . \nrepeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf\'s point-of-view approach that\'s interesting the first couple of times it\'s employed , then becomes tedious . \nand the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they\'re matched to . \ndirector anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel . \nas a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . \n ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that\'s rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a "" bad movie "" sort of way , but that\'s a dubious distinction . \nultimately , it\'s an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn\'t unbearable to sit through , it isn\'t a howl , either . \n'",0
"b'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force . "" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\'s story or obi-wan\'s . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\'s a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one . "" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\'t possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\'s accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\'t completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence . \nyou accept that he\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\'t mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\'s destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won\'t win any major oscars . \nit probably won\'t beat titanic\'s box office record . \nand it\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can\'t live up to it\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it\'s still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n'",1
"b'georges polti once wrote a paper called "" the thirty-six dramatic situations , "" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . \nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , "" there\'s nothing new under the sun . "" \nthe faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . \nthere\'s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . \ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . \nmaking use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather "" through the back door .

"b'weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven\' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we\'re given , \' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji\' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman\'s world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar\'s piece "" zycie za zycie\' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney\'s characterization as meryl , truman\'s "" wife "" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman\'s `father\' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman\'s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? \' \ni couldn\'t wait to know myself , though i didn\'t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \n'",1

"b'the catch phrase for disney\'s rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . \n "" it wasn\'t me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . \nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can\'t take all the blame , but he sure can\'t justify himself with his own simple tag line either . \nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . \nas a 30-year-old , fred hasn\'t grown up much , but at least he\'s somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . \nwhen an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . \n . \n . \nfred . \nyes , although he\'s an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn\'t think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . \nfor the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child\'s play . \nhis passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . \noverbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids\' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . \nfrom here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . \nyou know , standard kid movie material . \nalmost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . \nwe get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . \nwhile he\'s not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he\'s just as unlikeable . \nto say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . \nwhy ? \nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . \nclassic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . \nstan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . \npeter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it\'s best . \nwilliams , on the other hand , can\'t garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . \nas for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . \nthis is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . \ngiving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i\'ll admit to laughing a few times . \nthe amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! \ni must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn\'t crack up over every little thing . \nthen again , maybe they were asleep . \nsome people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren\'t the targeted audience and therefore aren\'t meant to , and won\'t , enjoy them . \nsadly , it\'s also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it\'s presented right . \na two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? \nand saying that a parent\'s perspective isn\'t important is quite a poor theory to have when they\'re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place . \n'",0
"b""full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . \nthis film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . \nhowever , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . \nthese sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . \nas in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . \nthe opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved . \nfrom there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . \napparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . \nprivate joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . \nhartman . \nthe film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on . \nthe entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt . \nhartman , continues on . \nprivate pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . \nhe continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop . \nthat is , until sgt . \nhartman comes up with a new plan . \nhe will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . \npyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst . \npyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . \nafter graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service . \nhe is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . \nwhen he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start . \njoker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way . \nhe also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die . \nagain , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . \na few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . \nfull metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past . \nthis film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others . \nthat , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion . \none thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . \nunfortunately , many did . \n""",1
"b""a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . \nwell , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . \nanyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . \nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . \nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . \nthe story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . \nthe captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . \nto add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . \nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . \nnone of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . \nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . \nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . \nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . \nit looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . \nalso on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? \nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? \nregardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . \nas to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . \nthe actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . \nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . \nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . \nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . \nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . \nas the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . \nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . \n""",0

"b'it should have been a classic . \na great cast of respected supporting actors . \nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \nhowever , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \n "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven\'t already figured it out ) is very low . \nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk\'s home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \nanother major problem with "" mystery men "" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone\'s joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of "" american pie "" and "" there\'s something about mary . "" \n "" mystery men "" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . \nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . \nso why continue to watch ? \nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . \n "" mystery men "" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says "" i knew you could do it ! "" \n "" mystery men "" fails in every category it attempts to pass . \nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . \nterrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . \n "" i\'m unpredictable ! "" \nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out . \nno ben , you\'re the complete opposite . \n'",0
"b'and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners , not rating anything lower than your standard "" this movie sucks "" , along comes this cinematic atrocity and he\'s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick , even the bravest movie-goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time . \nyes , despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie , the latest highlander doesn\'t seem to have anything going for it . \noh stinky movie , let me count thee ways . . . \nplot : ( from what i understood ) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal . . . or \nsomething along those lines . \ncritique : a complete and utter mess . \ndisjointed , incoherent , boring , corny , filled with bad dialogue . . . and \nthat\'s just the first thirty minutes ! \nthis film doesn\'t seem to know what to do with itself . \nit\'s confusing to anyone who doesn\'t know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group ) . \nthe film doesn\'t explain anything about itself . . . it \njust goes from one inexplicable situation to another . \none moment they\'re in the present time , the next moment , they\'re in italy in the 1600s . \nwhy ? \nwho knows . \nwhat are they talking about ? \nno idea . \nflashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! \nhullo . . . ? ! ? \nconfused yet ? \ni was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story . \nrandom swordplay , mad max-like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? \nor were they in the present at that time ? \nwho knows . . . and to be honest . . . who \nseriously cares ! \nthis series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it . \nplease , please . . . for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie-making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! \neven christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one . \nthe director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action , some fast-motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere . \nand is there anything spectacular about the sword-play or fight scenes ? \nnope . \nand i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close-ups . . . yipes , \nthe man is not aging gracefully , is he ? \noh boy , and i haven\'t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over-acting that i\'ve seen in years . \nthe man who plays kell in this movie , bruce payne , should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near . \noveracting is not a hobby for this guy . . . it\'s \na living ! \nhe\'s also very funny , not purposely though . \nall in all , the movie stinks . \nnuff said . \n'",0
"b'a backdrop of new year\'s eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . \nthe decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look . \nbut despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with "" 200 cigarettes . "" \na better title for this nostalgic mess would be "" 50 missed opportunities . "" \nwhat is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ? \nit\'s certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies . \nthere\'s courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in "" the opposite of sex "" ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about "" good will hunting . "" \nperhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ? \nmaybe it looked good on paper . \n "" 200 cigarettes "" is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york\'s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) . \namong the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines . \nmore subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . \nall the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick\'s cube . \nricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . \ninfamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . \nhudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies\' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . \nare we laughing yet ? \nthe film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . \ngame performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . \ntoo many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other . \nif this is "" 200 cigarettes , "" then get me 200 nicotine patches . \n'",0
"b'let\'s face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was "" goldeneye "" was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , "" a view to a kill "" or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . \nbut it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . \nthe new "" m "" is a woman ) . \n "" tomorrow never dies "" is the picture "" goldeneye "" should have been ; it\'s also the most entertaining bond outing since "" the spy who loved me "" . \nthe new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . \nas an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . \ncarver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars\' german scientist from "" dr . \nstrangelove "" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . \nit\'s up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . \nenter michelle yeoh , fresh from "" supercop "" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . \nthey make a great team . \n "" tomorrow never dies "" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of "" turner & hooch "" . \nspottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in "" goldeneye "" . \nmoreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . \nreturned in brosnan\'s eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv\'s "" remington steele "" , as has his deadpan wit . \nand though carver\'s motives are muddy ( when carver explains that "" genius is insanity with some success "" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . \nin the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . \nthere a few too many explosions in "" tomorrow never dies "" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . \nand it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . \nas it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i\'m not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . \nnow that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . \nit\'s time to put them to use in something truly special . \nthere\'s no mistaking , however , that "" tomorrow never dies "" is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you\'ll walk out wanting more bond movies . \n-reviewed december 17 , 1997 \n'",1
"b'tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . \nand here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . \ni didn\'t expect much from this latest "" interpretation "" of pierre boulle\'s classic novel planet of the apes . \ni mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those "" damn dirty apes , "" in one of his best roles of his career ? \nsadly , i sat down to watch burton\'s version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . \nthis time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . \nleo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered "" smart "" chimps into the storms to collect data . \nleo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he\'s thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . \nleo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . \nthe kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo\'s ship . \nalong the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! \nin the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . \nwhile rick baker\'s makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the "" surprise "" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . \nwahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . \nthis remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . \nthe ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . \neven chuck heston\'s anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . \nbut the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . \neven though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . \neven joel schumacher could have directed this film . \nhe probably should have . \nburton\'s predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one\'s place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee\'s big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . \ni suppose that\'s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole . \n'",0
"b'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson , this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n'",0
"b'the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it\'s about and why it\'s good or bad . \ni feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen "" get carter "" i really can\'t tell you what it\'s about although i could go on and on about how and why it\'s a bad movie . \n "" get carter "" falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room . \nyou might call them the "" steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . "" \nyou know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development . \nthey have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at . \nsylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother\'s funeral . \nhe believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn\'t die from a dwi accident . \ncarter\'s one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid . \nhis face alone is pretty intimidating and there\'s quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice . \nstallone\'s performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn\'t realize he\'s mocking himself . \nthe actual story involves carter\'s investigation into his brother richie\'s death . \nhe\'s in a town that\'s not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well . \nmickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) . \nthere\'s also another plot involving richie\'s mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter\'s still-living relatives . \ni\'m rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible . \ni could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all . \ni don\'t like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally . \nyes , "" get carter "" is just that complicated and complex . \nand what\'s worse is that it\'s not this intricate to make it seem smart like "" the usual suspects "" for example - just the opposite . \nyou get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn\'t remember what had already happened and didn\'t figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax . \nall you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn\'t a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes . \nalthough the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another . \nmaking a movie entirely about criminals doesn\'t necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters . \nmel gibson starred in "" payback "" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn\'t help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter . \nso ultimately "" get carter "" fails for pretty much every selling point it has . \ncarter is not a likable character and you really don\'t care if he gets revenge or not . \nthe action sequences are not at all exciting or original . \nthe enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c\'mon , you know who\'s going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) . \nin the end you don\'t feel nearly satisfied with the results . \nthe filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible . \n * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it\'s seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it\'s always raining . \n'",0

"" \nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \nthat the director\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\'s apartment . \ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \nwhat is progress ? \nwhat can one expect out of life ? \nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\'s guernica had for him . \nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , "" make the world go away "" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

"b""in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . \nin other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . \ngibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . \nmel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . \nso he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . \nbut , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . \nto make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . \nhis ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . \npayback is often a very violent film . \nto its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . \nthe film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . \nwhen the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . \nso as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . \nit's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . \nin this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . \nbut hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . \nmy guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . \ngibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . \nhe almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . \nthis time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . \nthe man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . \nif i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role . \nin the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work . \n""",1

"b'melvin van peebles\' "" sweet sweetback\'s baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\'s responsibilities himself . \nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \nthe storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple . \nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \nvan peebles\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \nat the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . "" \nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \nof course , with today\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn\'t seem all that revolutionary . \nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \nat that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . "" \nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \n "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \n "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies . \nwhen it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \nnevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\'s about one man\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \nthe fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) . \nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it . \nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die . \ndon\'t let them kill him . \nlet him die on his own . "" \nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out ! \na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . "" \nbeyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \nwatching "" sweet sweetback "" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \nthe legacy of "" sweet sweetback\'s baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \n'",1
"b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\'t be able to get into an "" r "" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \nthere\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as "" erotic . "" \ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \nsure , there\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \nthis creature , dubbed "" eve "" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \nhis intention is obviously world domination . \nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\'s no damping his ardor . \ni\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\'s father -- "" underused "" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( "" invisible "" would be more like it ) . \ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \nmeanwhile , justin lazard\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \ndo i recommend the movie ? \nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \nhere\'s hoping there\'s no species 3 . \n'",0
"b'i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago . \ni guess my memory really sucks . \nthere is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . \nthe laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren\'t that great . \ncaddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . \nmichael o\'keefe plays said caddy . \nwhy they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . \nthe movie doesn\'t seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . \nthe only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . \nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . \nbill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . \nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn\'t even crack a smile on my face with his character\'s lame zen-like approach to golfing . \nthere are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . \ni guess that\'s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . \ni\'m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . \nnothing about this movie works . \nit wouldn\'t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn\'t going to fly . \nmost of the scenes just couldn\'t possibly be funny . \nit\'s as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . \ni\'m sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . \nin reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . \nthere is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the "" hot babe "" of the movie walking by in her bikini . \nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . \neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . \nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . \nbut for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack . \n'",0
"b""you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . \nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \nit's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \nthat's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \nwe appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \nwillis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . \nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \ni'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \n""",1

"b'there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn\'t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film . \nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody "" . \nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \nbogart\'s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn\'t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \nbut the reason for that isn\'t the romance itself - it\'s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston\'s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault\'s relationship towards rick , and rick\'s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \nany way , even if we don\'t see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \n'",1

"b'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\'afro . \nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \ncomments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" \'s cast in paramount\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew . \nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . "" \nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \ni don\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \nmost people reading this probably haven\'t followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \nokay . let\'s move to the movie itself . \nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\'s crew . \naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\'ku homeworld . \nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\'a . \nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\'ku and plunder the planet\'s youth-restoring properties . \nsound pretty heavy ? \nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\'s constant barrage of humor . \nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \nsince they\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \ndespite many other critics\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\'afro well enough . \nru\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \nlike the baron , ru\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \nru\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \na particular plot point involving anij\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \ndespite star trek : insurrection\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \nit maintains roddenberry\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \ni\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \nrated pg , i can\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \n'",1

"b'seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\'s pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \n "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\'t want their kids to see . \nit\'s not that it\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \nand to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \nmike\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \nhe never sounds like he\'s reading from a script , nor that he\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison . \nit\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \ntechnically , the plot isn\'t unlike many children\'s sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid\'s "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\'s dealt and works with them . \nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\'t ( i . e . \nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \nmatt\'s good at gambling but he\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\'s stability but not much risk involved . \ncan someone who\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \neverything is told from mike\'s perspective , but we\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \nwhat separates "" rounders "" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \n'",1
"b""the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \nas a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \nkilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . \nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \nshue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \n""",1

"b'whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 . \nthe latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship . \nthe scary thing is that it\'s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month . \nthe crew works for several reasons . \nthe clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four "" past their prime "" wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach . \nthe wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their "" golden paradise "" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property . \nthe four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey "" bats "" pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike "" the brick "" donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony "" mouth "" donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home . \nthis "" simple plan "" suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who\'s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire . \nthe crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men . \ninstead of concentrating on bobby\'s search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production . \nthe acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character\'s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle . \na strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs . \nthe film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years . \nthe quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit . \nthe crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days . \nthe great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa . \nin the steady flow of "" extreme "" comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it\'s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting . \n'",1
"b'true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \nso it\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen . \nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey . \nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \nat his son\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \nre-christening himself as "" the apostle e . f . , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\'s lives . \nbut , always , sonny\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \nduvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear . \nin a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . "" \nthe strength of duvall\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \n "" i\'ve always called you jesus and you\'ve always called me sonny , "" he says . \nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \nthe main theme to emerge from "" the apostle "" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \nsonny\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \nit is that strength in sonny\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \nwatching duvall on-screen , it\'s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \nduvall knew that the power of the film\'s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn\'t need to be artificially enhanced . \nin this way , "" the apostle "" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \n'",1
"b'one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it\'s a wonderful life isn\'t perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . \nprobably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it\'s a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . \non christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . \nyou see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . \nthis one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . \nclarence has got his own problems , however . \nclarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . \nthe bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . \nbut before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey\'s life . \nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother\'s life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . \nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn\'t sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . \none christmas , potter gets his chance . \nuncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank\'s money . \nwithout the money , the bank must close down . \ngeorge is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . \nclarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . \nthis is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . \nit\'s a wonderful life does have its faults . \nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . \nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90\'s , like something out of a revisionist look . \nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . \nthere are , however , endearing moments in all of this . \ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50\'s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . \nthe story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . \nthere\'s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . \nit\'s a little too nice for my liking , at times . \nthere is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . \nbut watching it\'s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it\'s always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . \ncapra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . \ndonna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . \neveryone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . \nthere is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . \nstewart , however , is the king of all of this . \nhe is sometimes awkward , especially when saying "" merry christmas "" to all objects , animate or inanimate . \nbut he is james stewart , and he\'s lovably delightful throughout the film . \nhave i complained ?

"b'renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star\'s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \nwriter steven e . desouza\'s fairly straightforward plotline isn\'t as outre as _double_team_\'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \nit\'s all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \nwhile all of van damme\'s films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme\'s embarrassing directorial effort , 1996\'s _the_quest_ ) . \na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" \nand "" entrepreneurship , babycakes !

"b'losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing . \nreacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare . \nwhile we all might feel the desire to blow someone\'s head off with a shotgun when they don\'t seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid . \nthis isn\'t the case with sam baily - john travolta\'s slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city . \n "" i don\'t think people listen to guys like me , "" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum . \njust a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam\'s apprehension resulted in a brash decision . \nin an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to "" just listen "" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage . \nsam\'s overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won\'t be provided for . \nhe\'s not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he\'s somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren\'t helped any by the fact that banks wasn\'t overly compassionate with the let go . \noverall , he\'s just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we\'d deem "" far enough "" as the starting mark of some crazy race . \nmeanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene . \ncovering a "" fluff "" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could\'ve hoped for . \nhaving been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story . \nmax immediately bonds with sam . \nmax even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone . \nat first , max\'s intentions don\'t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him . \nthe media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . \nthe accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam\'s honest ambitions . \nalso involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . \nalda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . \nthen there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie . \nshe falls under max\'s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . \nkirshner\'s credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . \nstill , kirshner\'s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles . \ni wouldn\'t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . \nwhile the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . \nhoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . \nthey both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . \nthere is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could\'ve fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . \nthis isn\'t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . \nif for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out . \n'",1

"b""nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \noffender . \n""",0

"b'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat\'s the deal ? \nwatch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\'t snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it\'s simply too jumbled . \nit starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\'s going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\'s biggest problem . \nit\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don\'t know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\'s unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn\'t stick because it doesn\'t entertain , it\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\'s \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \n'",0
"b' "" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred "" . \na blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . \nbut no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento\'s most consistently successful film . \nwhat impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento\'s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . \nscreenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . \nno question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . \nfortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis "" . \nthe film\'s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . \njessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . \narriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . \nwhat happens next - and i don\'t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock\'s infamous shower scene in psycho . \nit\'s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento\'s own . \nthough nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria\'s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . \nwe meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . \nseveral more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn\'t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film\'s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that\'s most impressive . \nthe english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . \nfortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . \nthe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . \nand the soundtrack ? \nit is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . \nas it stands , the use of goblin\'s music in suspiria is outstanding . \napparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . \na stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer\'s overall experience . \neven better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you\'ll get the added bonus of widescreen . \nand the colours ! \ndeep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . \nthe cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . \na nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . \nthese kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento\'s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . \nsuspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . \nthe gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that\'s always been one of argento\'s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . \n'",1
"b""the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . \nif you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . \nthey have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . \nbut , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . \nfor instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . \nthey had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? \nwell , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . \nunfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . \nthat title would be the confusing . \nok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . \nit basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . \nliam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . \nthe haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . \nbefore i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . \nfirst , the house is great- looking . \nit looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . \nit looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . \nthis is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . \nthings look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . \nhaunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . \nthe hill house is not eerie . \nit is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . \never heard of lili taylor ? \nbefore this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . \nshe gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . \ndespite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind . \nowen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . \nhe is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . \nall of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . \nwilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . \nliam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . \ntheir characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . \nthey just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin . \nthe plot is terrible . \nthe opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . \nas i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . \nnell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . \nit makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . \nhe forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information . \nfor instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . \nbut , we get zilch for the other four . \nplus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . \nand the worst part : most horror films have killings . \nfor some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . \nno reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . \noverall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . \nbad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . \nhopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . \nhopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . \nand hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . \n""",0
"b""it must be tough to be a mob boss . \njust ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . \ni can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . \nsuffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . \nand who better than billy crystal . \nafter appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . \nplaying vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . \ncasting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think . \nplaced in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . \nit's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so . \nthe man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . \nramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . \nthe only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . \nplaying the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . \nthe supporting cast sparkles . \njoe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' . \nthe movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . \nthe situation is just too cute to resist . \nit's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . \nbut hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . \nand near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat . \n""",1
"b""arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse . \nit's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? \nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . \nin this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . \nwith the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! \nparts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . \nyes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . \nanyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie . \nit just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . \nsure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . \nit's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . \naside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . \ni'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . \nspeaking of action , where was it in this film ? \nthere was hardly any explosions or fights . \nthe devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt . \nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . \ni was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . \ni also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much . \nthere was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . \nthe budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . \nit's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . \ndo they even read these things anymore ? \nit sure doesn't seem like it . \nthankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film . \nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . \nthe guy is creepy looking anyway ! \nwhen it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie . \ndon't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action . \nit's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . \nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . \n""",0
"b'i admit it . \ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . \nwatching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . \nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . \nand you know they\'ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa\'s elves . \nhe later decks a reindeer . \nhey , man , why don\'t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you\'re at it ? \njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . \narnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . \nwhat can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can\'t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? \narnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . \nhe races from the office to his son\'s karate game , only to find out he missed it . \nand his kid distrusts him because he\'s never around . \n ( gee , we haven\'t seen that in a movie before . ) \narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son\'s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . \nso arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . \nlet me back up for a minute here -- arnold\'s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . \nwatches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin\' turboman sheets . \ni\'d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it\'s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . \nbut nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don\'t recognize him until the last minute . \nthis is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . \nmost painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . \ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . \nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" ) , it\'s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it\'s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . \nmaybe that\'s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine . \n'",0
"b""note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \nand with good reason . \nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \nat least it all looks good . \nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \n""",0

"" \nthe plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . "" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" \nthere\'s even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that "" they\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , "" chicken run "" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug\'s life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n'",1

"b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \n>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . \n1996\'s the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . \nas most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . \nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . \nas far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . \nthe first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn\'t really like it . \nhowever , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i\'ve had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . \nand to my surprise , it grew on me . \nthe plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . \nsee , steven\'s been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn\'t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . \nalso , some of the cable guy\'s antics have been creeping him out . \ncarrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn\'t enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . \nfor me , its not the movie as a whole that\'s enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven\'s apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . \nperhaps the fact that more of carrey\'s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . \nand if you really want to see something , you\'ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane\'s "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . \nthe cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . \ni didn\'t particularly like steven\'s girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . \nalso , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . \nstill , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you\'re at the video store and can\'t think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . \nor if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won\'t have to wait long . ) \nhell , that\'s what i do every day . \n'",1
"b' "" tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! "" \na favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . \nit wasn\'t just the film\'s disappointing box office performance . \nindeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . \nno , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . \nin a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! "" . \nexecutives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . \nmommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . \nunfortunately , faye dunaway\'s energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film\'s only redeeming feature . \nbased on daughter christina crawford\'s trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . \nif you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . \nthe film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother\'s will . \njoan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . \nbut that\'s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film\'s end . \nthe script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . \nfrank perry\'s direction is no more than competent , and dunaway\'s bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . \nin fairness , the film\'s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . \nwhen the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina\'s own acting and career ambitions . \ncrawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . \nyou also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . \nah , but there is dunaway\'s performance . \nand what a delicious piece of campery it often is . \nhaving just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . \nshe has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she\'s making . \nspotting a young tree she doesn\'t like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! ! \nfetch me the axe ! ! "" \nwith which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . \nin the film\'s most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter\'s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . \noh dear ! \nsounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn\'t it ? \nthis time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! !

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \nand scream\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \nit\'s hard to understate this last point . \nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained . ) \nand , much like mr . tarantino\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\'s only at about the film\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\'ve ever seen ) . \nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\'s ; while the first film\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \nthey\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \nthere\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\' portia di rossi ) . \nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \none problem that scream didn\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n ( it doesn\'t help matters any that the killer\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \nthey\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \nit\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \nshe doesn\'t have any compelling presence , and there\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\'s the returning heroine . \ngiven this , and the fact that there\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\'s role isn\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\'s shoes ) , it\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \nthe film\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\'ve seemed obvious . ) \nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\'s character said in the first film : "" no , please don\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! "" \nlook what that got her . \n'",1

"b""i'm giving this stinker . \nnormally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . \nbut the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . \ni'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . \nmaybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . \nin mine , it's not . \nor maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . \nbecause only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . \nat least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . \nbrooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . \nwrong mel ! \ni would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . \nthis idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . \nhe sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . \nbut the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . \nthe governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . \n ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) \nlamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . \nhold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . \nit's just too funny . \nracism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? \noh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . \ni'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . \nbut i digress . \nanyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . \ngolly , will the hilarity just never end ? \nhe ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . \ntogether , they save the day from evil . \nnot one person in this movie gives a decent performance . \nwilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . \nok , he really didn't -- but he should have . \nthe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . \ni did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . \ni admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . \nactually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . \ni can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \nmel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . \n""",0
"b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \nif you\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \nthe problem we come to is that we\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \ni\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between "" entrapment "" and "" blackmail "" . \nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \nwell , you\'d be wrong . \nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \ni\'ll tell you why : because it\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself "" it\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ?

"b'a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . \nthere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i\'ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . \nthe film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can\'t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . \npen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var\'s "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . \nthe best you can say about her , is that she\'s not to blame for this picture being so off . \nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . \nthe story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents\' cook . \nto cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . \nshe is able to control it now as long as she doesn\'t drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love . \nin other words , she has to be in control of things . \nin her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him . \nthey open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he\'s a loafer . \none night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco . \nwe don\'t see her in flight , so i can\'t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . \nshe visits her friend\'s apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . \nto cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . \nher luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . \nyou can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good . \nso he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again . \nhe brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window . \nhe sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him . \nwhen he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he\'s hired as a regular on the show . \nthe show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . \nbut they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he\'s a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . \ncliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did . \nthese tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . \nit was an insult to one\'s intelligence . \ni\'m sure that i\'m not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . \nif the film wasn\'t terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers . \nit was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . \nthis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn\'t look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . \nits more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven . \n'",0
"b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \n "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\'t look like anything comprehendable . \nit\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . "" \nwith "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\'s doing ) . \nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\'t call the authorities for help . \nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \nthe exec\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \nmcquarrie doesn\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\'s to the point of surrealism . \nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\'s rules and regulations . \nevery scene with caan\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\'re talking about . \nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\'s trash . \nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \nit\'s like a dream without any appeal . \ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\'t move . \nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \nyou\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \nthere\'s a lot of things i didn\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\'s army . \nif they were suicidal they wouldn\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \nthere\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \nand it\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \ni can\'t say either for "" the way of the gun , "" because it has very little going for it and i can\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \n'",0
"b'life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . \nit combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . \nit\'s an italian film , but don\'t let that discourage you . \nsubtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . \nlife is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . \nthe year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \ntheir romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she\'s already engaged to another man . \ncan guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? \nwhat do you think ? \nhowever , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . \nthe fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . \nunable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . \nhe pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . \nas you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . \nas a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . \nas a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . \nroberto benigni\'s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin\'s , and it is easy to see why . \nhe is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero\'s "" triumph of the underdog "" spirit . \nlife is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . \nhowever , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . \nwith life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . \nit\'s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i\'ve had at the movies this year . \n'",1
"b""david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . \nit also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . \nlost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . \ndavid spade is not the problem with lost and found . \nhe plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . \nthe story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . \ndylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . \nand so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . \nthere are three good things about lost and found . \nthe first is spade . \nthe second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . \nlastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . \nunfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute . \nthis kind of physical humor is dead . \npollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel . \nthis is where i start to get fuzzy . \nalso in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . \ngiven the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow . \nand , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? \npredictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated . \ndavid spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . \nthere are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . \npatrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . \njon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . \ndespite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work . \nif you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present . \n""",0
"b'these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . \n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon\'s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \ntwo of them , following the murder of luger\'s ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \nthe rest simply doesn\'t work . \nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \n'",0

"b'i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson\'s performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you\'ve basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon\'t get me wrong , it\'s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson\'s performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson\'s character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry\'s apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher\'s far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland\'s own opinions . \nmel gibson isn\'t the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can\'t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry\'s life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry\'s life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren\'t , you should still like this film . \n'",1

"b'in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone\'s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . \nwall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . \ncritics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . \ni\'m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . \ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone\'s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . \nstone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . \nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . \nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . \nit\'s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . \ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \nand not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \nmaybe stone\'s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone\'s piece of crap . \nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room\'s is much more subtle and touching . \nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn\'t shove it in our faces . \nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn\'t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all "" . \nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way . \nhe\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \nhis job is to influence trainee\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \nit\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \naffleck\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\'s performance . \naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \nthey aren\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \ni know this story . \nwe all do . \nbut it can work if it\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\ director ben younger tells it . \nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \nhis style is sitcom bland . \nbut his writing isn\'t . \nyounger\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \nthe brokers \\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn\'t aware that he is one . \nwith the exception of affleck\'s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren\'t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he\'s ferociously cut throat . \nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it\'s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\'s friend and his mentor . \ndiesl shines in his minor role . \nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80\'s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70\'s . \nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can\'t have . \nnia long , as the firm\'s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi\'s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \nat one point he says to her "" i\'m just lookin\' for some chocolate love "" . \nit\'s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger\'s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth\'s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \nit\'s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \nthat message being , "" greed is bad "" . \nyes it\'s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven\'t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \nboiler room offers neither extreme . \nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \n'",1
"b'you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and \nit\'s not a comedy ! \nand what a strange career path for director chuck russell . \nhe starts his career off with a decent take on the "" nightmare on elm street "" series with his debut as director on installment number three . \nhe follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . \nso then he thought , "" let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes "" ? ! ? \nstrange dude and one crappy flick . \nplot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . \na satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl\'s aunt wants to . . . well , \nsave her from those damn devil worshippers ! \nenter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you\'ve just about got the gist of things here . \ncritique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot . \nwhat\'s good about this movie ? \nwell , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children\'s shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . \nthe little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn\'t really do all that much . \nand believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film\'s first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film\'s entire basis of believability . \nfor some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is \na dumb one ! \nadd that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? \nat least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you\'ve got yourself a pretty bad movie . \nand why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? \ndid they owe the director a favor or something ? \ntogether , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci\'s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs . \nthe worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of "" sneaking up "" on a man\'s house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! \nuuuhmm . . . how\'s \nabout knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! \nanyway , i don\'t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) . \nand did basinger lose some of her acting "" talent "" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? \ndifficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly . \neither way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film . \nbut if you really don\'t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and "" kid "" -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don\'t bring anything new to the table . . . well , \ndrink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year . \n'",0
"b'kids today , they don\'t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies . \nno , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball . \nthrough a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there\'s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention . \nour man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a\'s , where he is hoping for his big break . \nit\'s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman\'s thong ( don\'t ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! \n ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn\'t even bother . . . \nbut of course he makes a play for her . \nsummer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan\'s non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . \nworst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that \'70s show\'s wilmer valderrama and beverly d\'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . \nin fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it\'s been done better somewhere else . \nfor starters , the film has a major question of identity . \nit\'s definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . \nthe worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion . \nby the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . \ndad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . \ncoach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he\'s got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . \nryan\'s catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to "" play catch "" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . \nryan\'s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-\'em-tiger-we\'re-behind-you talk . \nand the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel . \nbefore long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? \ndon\'t answer that . \nthe only real joy in the film is found in biel\'s character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . \nshe\'s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade . \nwhen she\'s on screen , the time flies by . \nwhen she\'s not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . \nfor a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? \nfor her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . \nhollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . \nor vice versa . \neither way , good luck , jessica . \nas for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze\'s next "" summer catch "" is liable to be a venereal disease . \n'",0
"b""my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \noff the high board . \nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \ni found this scene offensive . \nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \n""",0
"b'movies don\'t come much more ridiculously titled than "" i still know what you did last summer , "" but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . \nmore than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel\'s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what "" you "" did _last_ summer "" you "" actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since "" i "" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it\'s really illogical to say that "" i "" _still_ know what "" you "" did _last_ summer . \nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter "" i still know , "" the longer "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" or the appropriate "" stupid people getting hacked to bits . "" \nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . \nfor example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? \nprobably not , but that\'s precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . \njulie , you\'ll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997\'s surprise hit "" i know what you did last summer , "" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it\'s a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . \nin this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . \nyeah , right . \ntheir island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . \nhe sports the same gorton\'s fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he\'s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . \nthough i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . \nin a sense , that\'s the movie\'s glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . \nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway\'s derivative "" i still know "" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . \nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? \nhe twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you\'d think he\'d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . \neven prequel "" summer "" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . \nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and "" scream "" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into "" i know "" \'s unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like "" yo "" ; you\'ll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . \nif "" i know what you did last summer , "" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive "" scream "" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly "" i still know what you did last summer "" deserves a full-blown roasting on "" mystery science theatre 3000 .

"b'in 1977 , something never though possible happened . \nthe film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . \nthe film set a new standard for special effects in film . \nnot only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . \nthe plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . \nthe legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . \nthe jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . \ndarth vader is the leader of the dark side . \nben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . \ndarth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side . \nyears after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble . \nr2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call "" driods "" , or robots that are of assistance to humans . \nwhile an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship . \nto obi-wan kenobi pleading for help . \nthe princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine . \nthe jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell . \nthey are bought by luke skywalker\'s ( mark hamill ) family . \nwhile luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found . \nluke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke\'s father , who is now dead . \nluke also learns his family was a jedi . \nafter luke\'s family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all . \nben wants to create a new jedi . \nfirst , the two must find princess leia and serve her . \nhan solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary . \nafter meeting up with leia , the film really picks up . \nluke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur . \nstar wars is an amazing epic . \nthe plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . \nthe special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . \nthe space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch . \nthe ships flown by all are very unique and creative . \nthe costumes are also out of this world . \nthe scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . \nthere are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever . \nthe entire premise of star wars is amazing . \nthe creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . \neven the human characters are different . \nevery character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films . \nthe acting on everyone\'s part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness\'s . \neven though the concept is not realistic at all , it is pulled off very nicely . \nthe acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work . \nif any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke . \nthe ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward . \nin early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . \nthe film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 . \na few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film . \nthink that\'s enough ? \non may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope . \nwith this , star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time . \n'",1
"b' "" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year . \nit\'s a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords . \nthough i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint . \nfinally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie . \nstuart little is a mouse . \nhe has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles . \na nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city . \nthey have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son . \nat first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat . \ngeorge doesn\'t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond . \nstuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are . \nthe littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back . \nhesitating the littles know what\'s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart\'s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending . \none thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects . \njust like in "" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace "" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real . \nfrom the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows . \nanother movie that this has in common with is "" babe "" with it\'s talking animals and people understanding them . \nit has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids . \nmichael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the "" homeward bound "" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could . \nhe to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable . \nanother gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball . \nwhen he was timon in 1994\'s "" the lion king "" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in "" stuart little "" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . \nfor the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well . \nshe fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little . \nboth make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996\'s "" jerry maguire "" . \neven though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other . \n "" stuart little "" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter . \nwe get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie . \nits nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see . \neven though it has a $90 million dollar budget i\'m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively . \nfor all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know "" stuart little "" and "" toy story 2 "" are by far the best family films this year . \na winner . ? \n'",1
"b'ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . \nthese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . \nif it\'s not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . \nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes . \nto anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can\'t take it anymore . \nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled "" goofs "" . \nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies . \nwell , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology "" . \nand truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . \nthe plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . \nmore specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . \nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . \nthe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . \nhe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . \nthe film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . \ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . \noh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . \nreally , i can\'t think of much more to say about the film\'s plot aside from what i\'ve said . \nit\'s just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . \nthanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . \nthis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . \nto sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . \nif you\'re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . \nalthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . \nhopefully , this film didn\'t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . \n'",0
"b'that is , unless you\'re one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . \ni can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . \nwhy someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . \nhowever , if they * hadn\'t * given it away , the film would\'ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter . \nobviously , the producers thought they could remake "" the deep end of the ocean , "" throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama . \n "" double jeopardy "" offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he didn\'t see to be on screen half as much as judd did . \nit also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full-of-tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot . \nhalf the time i\'m wondering whether i\'m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised . \njudging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . \nthe movie\'s stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . \nimplausible material , no less . \nloose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , "" that is * not * possible * . "" \nthat kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like "" double jeopardy "" that tries to pass itself off as serious drama . \neverything seems dragged out , overplayed . \nwhen they should\'ve kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early . \n'",0

"b'a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark\'s migration from the "" good vibrations "" and "" calvin klein undie ad "" guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . \nplot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . \nboy likes girl . \ngirl likes boy . \nboy and girl begin dating . \nparents of girl aren\'t crazy about the boy . \ngirl steps to boy\'s defense . \nfamily problems occur . \ngirl learns more about the boy . \nboy goes nuts . \nfun ensues . \ncritique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? \nwell , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . \nit isn\'t the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . \ni think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . \nthe soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if \nyou\'re into that kind of thing , that is : ) . \ni didn\'t much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . \nthen again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the "" big deal "" was about his daughter dating david . \nhis reply : "" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter .

"b'this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont\'s debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . \nbut the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . \nannie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . \nshe\'s going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . \nthey sacked him after he got sick . \nnow he wants the diamonds stored in the ship\'s safe for compensation . \nthat actually is the whole storyline . \nspeed 2 could do without dialogues . \nthe movie is all about images and remarkable sound . \ni don\'t really know why this is called an action movie . \nexcept for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . \nfirst we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . \nthen desaster strikes . \nsandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . \ni looked for the "" action "" but couldn\'t find it . \nmost of the time she is part of the decoration . \nthe only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . \nnow we know that she can handle a chain saw . \nwe also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . \nthe bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . \njason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . \nhis initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . \nhe does a pretty good job but i can\'t blame keanu reeves for declining this part . \nthen there\'s willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein\'s monster . \nhe doesn\'t succeed , though . \nan untidy appearance isn\'t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . \nbefore he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . \ni can\'t really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren\'t meant to be funny . \nespecially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . \nthere you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . \nin keeping with last year\'s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . \na really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . \nsome crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . \nhad they looked out the window they wouldn\'t have missed the huge ship racing toward them . \nthose of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . \nin an adequately equipped theater it\'s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . \nbut the ilm special effects can\'t save the movie . \nfor all the money they could have done better . \n'",0
"b'every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . \nnow i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . \nso i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . \nsee it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . \nsee the best film i have seen in 1996 . \nnot the best children\'s film . . . the \nbest film . \nperiod . \nbased on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . \nthe wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . \nwhen they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . \nbut things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . \nmatilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull\'s cruelty . \nit was this spring\'s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . \nand just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . \ndevito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . \nin one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . \nmatilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . \nit is also characteristic of the best children\'s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don\'t realize that they are learning them . \nthere is a hilarious moment when matilda\'s television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . \nmatilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i\'m big and you\'re little , i\'m right and you\'re wrong . "" \nmore specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people\'s notions of how she should behave . \nit is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . \nfinally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . \ndevito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . \nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . \nbut there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda\'s classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda\'s father . \ni can\'t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . \nmatilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . \ni will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . \nand now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . \n'",1
"b' "" party camp , "" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i\'ve seen in awhile . \na late rip-off of the "" meatballs "" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \nthat\'s really about all that can be said about the "" plot "" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \nhow fun ! \nsince , "" party camp , "" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \nit\'s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \nat least , then , it wouldn\'t have been such a chore to sit through . \nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn\'t the least bit funny . \nit was groan-inducing . \nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \nso what saves , "" party camp , "" from the dreaded zero star rating ? \nwell , that\'s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \n'",0
"b' "" the faculty , "" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995\'s "" desperado "" and 1996\'s "" from dusk till dawn "" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996\'s "" scream "" and 1997\'s "" scream 2 "" ) , is being called a cross between "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the breakfast club , "" and i don\'t think i could describe it any better than that . \nthe film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . \nthe six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet \'n southern new girl in town . \nalthough the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . \ncasey is delilah\'s photojournalist assistant ;

piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the "" queen "" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \nalthough not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , "" the faculty "" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren\'t human . \nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan\'s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \n'",1
"b'eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\'s animated film anastasia was released . \nyou know disney , they can\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\'s friends for a couple weeks . \nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\'d never see the movie . \nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \nshe\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the "" savage "" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \nwhat\'s a king to do , though ? \nthe girl\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\'t deter her . \nariel saves the prince\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \nyou know she\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \nshe\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\'ll fall asleep forever . \nit\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \'50s . \nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl , "" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \n'",1
"b'mars attacks ! \n ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones . \nthis is director tim burton\'s finest film to date . \nmany will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films . \nhowever as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 . \nyou really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film . \nit is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you\'ve ever seen . \nonce the silly tone of the film is set , it\'s easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don\'t mix . \nthe plot is simple : martians invade the earth . \nbut it\'s different than any other invasion film . \nusually it\'s the evil aliens versus the heroic humans . \nthis time however , it\'s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans . \nthe martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i\'ve seen in a long time . \nthey look funny , they move funny , and their "" language "" is hilarious . \nand about the special effects . \nthe effects in mars attacks ! \nare just about the most flawless ones i\'ve seen to date . \nthe computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real . \nthere are just a couple of scenes that don\'t work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship . \nalso , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise . \nbut there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood . \ncould it have been funnier ? \ncertainly . \nwas it funny enough ? \nyes . \nwas i entertained ? \nabsolutely . \non a personal note , i\'d like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker . \nfinally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see . \nwhile he\'s not given the type of role that you can give a real "" performance "" in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue . \nthe preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him . \n'",1
"b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\'t ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit\'s good some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" \nmoments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit\'s pretty obvious the film\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n'",1
"b""apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . \ndirector ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \nif they ever reach it . \ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \nyou should enjoy it . \n""",1

"b'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \n\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\' , the headlines read . \nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a "" holocaust comedy "" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this "" beautiful princess "" , as he calls her . \nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \nlife treats them well until hitler\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a "" hogan\'s heros "" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\'s gravely serious subject . \nso , we\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a "" holocaust comedy "" . \nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \nthe film , despite critic\'s declarations of it being a "" triumph of the human spirit "" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \nsome have called the story an "" affirmation of the beauty of life "" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \nthe film\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \nhowever , i am not denying the movie\'s greatness . \nbelieve me , it\'s fantastic . \ni\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \nbut perhaps i\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \nmaybe the film\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \n'",1
"b'while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling\'s true genius as a film-maker is casting . \nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn\'s jeff spicoli ; in look who\'s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that\'s more than slightly one-sided . \nthey\'re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling\'s casting . \njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \nthey\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\'t . \nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\' situations pathetic . \nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\'s plot came via jane austen\'s emma ) . \nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\'s no reason to watch them . \npaul isn\'t just a nice guy , he\'s flawless ; consequently , he\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \nhis roommates aren\'t just inconsiderate , they\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \nand professor alcott isn\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \ndora\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\'t explored in sufficient detail . \nthere\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \ni don\'t know . . . \ncomic . \nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\'s "" scarborough fair/canticle .

"b'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn\'t keep the mystery for long , and once the big \'secret\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn\'t have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it\'s no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there\'s no-one to root for . \nwe\'re supposed to be on cage\'s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise\'s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film\'s use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don\'t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn\'t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere\'s a good story buried in snake eyes , it\'s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy \'number cruncher\' wrapped up in the case , there\'s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you\'re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . \na david wilcock review ? 1998 \n "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes \n'",0
"b'it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time . \nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner\'s story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \nthrough edgecomb\'s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . \nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . \nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . \nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . \nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . \nhutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \nthe film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show . "" \nthe scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . \nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don\'t even see him walk the infamous green mile . \nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . \nthe speed in "" the green mile "" is perfect . \nif time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . \nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \n "" the green mile "" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . \nfighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . \nif you survive the first third of "" the green mile "" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . \n'",1
"b'this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron\'s most heralded film , titanic . \npostponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . \nso , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? \nmy best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . \nno doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . \nit boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . \nto see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . \nthe effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . \nbut titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that\'s where the problem lies . \nthere is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . \ni\'ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : \nthe film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . \nwe see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . \nbill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . \nwhat he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . \nwe meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . \nrose is to be wed to a man she does not love . \nwe meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . \nthe two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . \nadd in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . \ni must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . \nshe is a pleasure to see on screen . \nwhen the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \nthe film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . \nthe effects are tremendous . \nfrom the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . \nwe saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . \nmy friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . \nwhen people are in the water , at film\'s end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . \ntitanic runs far too long . \nthe movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . \nand , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . \ndon\'t get me wrong about titanic . . . . it\'s \nnot a bad as i am making it out to be . \nit really is an exceptionaly well-made film . \nthe costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . \nthe ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . \nthis film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . \ncameron has certainly made his best film to date . \nunfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . \nit just doesn\'t have a strong supporting story . \nit\'s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . \nit just doesn\'t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . \ni predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . \nit is a film worth seeing . \ni predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . \nwith its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . \nthis will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . \ntitanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . \ni give titanic 3 stars ( . \nthat\'s not bad . \nron epstein \nriginally posted in home theater forum === \n'",1
"b'1992\'s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979\'s alien and 1986\'s aliens , savaged david fincher\'s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection\'s clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet\'s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon\'s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott\'s alien or the even greater film that james cameron\'s aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher\'s alien3 , jeunet\'s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n'",1

"b'shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . \nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn\'t count on it ? \nif this is your attitude , then i\'ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh\'s hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . \nif , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . \nnamely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king\'s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . \nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother\'s hands . \nhamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and \nthe game is afoot . . . . \nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . \nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . \ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . \nthe hamlet castle\'s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . \ncostuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . \nnot quite the denmark of the 1600\'s , the characters\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . \nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . \nin addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . \nas the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . \nfrom the anticipation of seeing his father\'s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . \nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh\'s acting and directing as to shakespeare\'s manuscript . \nhamlet seems to be a who\'s who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . \njulie christie , as hamlet\'s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . \nkate winslet as hamlet\'s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character\'s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . \nrichard briers as ophelia\'s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . \nnicholas farrell as hamlet\'s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . \nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . \nin some cases , this made for interesting scenes . \nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . \ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . \nhowever , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . \nas the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . \npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . \nhis off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . \ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . \nunfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . \njack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can\'t do shakespeare . \nas marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet\'s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . \ngerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of "" yes , my lord "" and "" no , my lord "" in the role of reynaldo . \nrichard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . \ni think he had two lines . \nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . \nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . \nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . \nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . \nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . \nthis only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . \nyou don\'t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . \nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . \nin it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king\'s english . \nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes . \n'",1

"b""no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . \nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \ni can't stand this anymore ! ' . \nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \n""",1
"b'reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . \nif hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . \nwith her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . \nit\'s practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . \nher next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . \nto aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . \neugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . \nyet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he\'s a lovable oaf . \nhe wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o\'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . \nhowever , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball\'s chance in hell . \n "" dear god , "" he prays . \n "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . "" \nguess who then shows up ? \nshe makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . \n "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . "" \nthere\'s even an escape clause . \nif elliot\'s wish doesn\'t go exactly the way he likes , he need only \'beep\' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . \nthe remainder of the film consists of elliot\'s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison\'s love . \nbut when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he\'ll soon learn that the devil is in the details . \nfor example , ( and we\'ve seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he\'s a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . \napparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . \nhis other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . \nsoon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . \ngiven the mischievous nature of the devil , "" bedazzled "" has many amusing moments . \na lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . \nhe ably assumes various personas . \nhis funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . \nallison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . \nhurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . \nit\'s clear that she\'s having a good time with it all . \nyet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . \nbut that would be playing with fire . \nwhat they\'ve got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . \n'",1

"" \ni asked . \n "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" \n "" why aren\'t these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" \n "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" \nthese were just some of my questions early on . \nlater , i asked , "" where\'s the magic of the first three films ? "" \nand "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? \' \nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you\'re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \nit\'s an embarrassment . \ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn\'t used . \nthere are a few of each , but they\'re all token attempts . \nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \nthis is not what i wanted to see . \ni didn\'t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \nthere isn\'t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \nfirst of all , we don\'t learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \nnot one thing . \nwhat was his life like before this film ? \nwell , i imagine he didn\'t have one . \nthat\'s why he feels like a plot device . \nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\'s recently retired from film ( i don\'t blame him , honestly ) . \nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\'ve ever had to endure , but he\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \ni\'ve seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas , "" but the phantom menace is the first one i\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \ni can\'t say that i didn\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \ncan\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \nand then there\'s the question of magic . \nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \njohn williams\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\' direction . \ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \nmine weren\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \ni don\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\'t . \nit\'s here to stay . \ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \n'",0
"b'the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you "" it\'s just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\'s movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" \nand "" mesa go now , okeday ?

"b'i won\x12t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . \ni saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . \nso take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day\x12s work . \ni didn\x12t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing \x16 but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . \nsigourney weaver , who\x12s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of \x13ripley , \x14 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists\x12 use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . \nin no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . \ni\x12m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now we\x12ll just ignore it and move on . \nwhy , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? \nwell , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . \nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . \nthey ( yawn ) were wrong . \nit doesn\x12t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth . \nthere\x12s a little saying that goes something like this : \x13if you\x12re going to make a bad film , do it well . \x14 \ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . \nalien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . \nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot . \nin one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . \nanother one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . \nfair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . \nif you think i\x12m struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . \none exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . \nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . \nso in a film where the one liners come as bad as \x13earth man , what a shit hole\x14 and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . \noh , and in case you\x12re wondering about my bag of lollies \x16 the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . \nso all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie\x05 \n'",0

"b'maybe this mission should have been scrubbed \nmission to mars \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nthere\'s a world of difference between artists and technicians . \nthe artist has a vision to create something new . \nhe may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it\'s something you\'ve never seen before . \na good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it\'s going to be just a xerox . \nobviously successful films need both skills . \nbrian de palma is a masterful technician . \nhe\'s spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . \nhe usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote . \naside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead . \nin de palma\'s latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . \nto tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 "" . \ni enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters "" . \nnasa has set its sights for mars . \nwhen the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet . \nthey don\'t do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . \nand it\'s all so boring . \nthere are so many scenes that just don\'t work , it\'s difficult to begin . \nwhen the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching . \nerror . \nthe most interesting character ( and that\'s not saying much ) is killed off . \nerror . \nthe alien is laughable . \nerror . \nthe rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . \nerror . \nthere\'s some nice eyecandy . \nthe face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool . \na three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world . \nmaneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic . \nbut there\'s so much more that feels as if we\'ve been there before . \nfrom "" 2001 "" , there\'s the rotating space station , the blinding white room . \n>from "" close encounters "" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . \nthe list goes on . \nthe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . \neven gary sinise and tim robbins can\'t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . \nno one seems to care about anything that happens . \nyou won\'t either . \nthe absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day . \nthey should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film . \n'",0
"b""this movie stinks ! \nalthough it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss . \ni knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color . \nthis might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow . \nand what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . \nor what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . \nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? \nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . \nfor example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . \nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . \nbut instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . \nduh ! \nultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . \nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . \nno , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . \neventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . \ni won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . \ni will just mention one final flaw . \nbrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . \nthe rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . \nhe is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . \nhe needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . \ndoes he phone the doctor ? \nno , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . \nyou have been warned , stay away from this one . \n""",0
"b'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n'",1

"b'i can hear the question already . \nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \nwhile "" everyone\'s "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion\'s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones\' script is . \ni left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \ni left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \n "" everyone "" features nothing allen hasn\'t done before storywise . \nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films . \nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut . \nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what\'s most important . \nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in "" portrait of a lady , "" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \nunfortunately , what didn\'t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \neven worse , i don\'t find myself feeling bad that i\'ve forgotten . \nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \nit was the script that couldn\'t convince me to care about anyone . \nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \njones\' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \nin the end , the movie\'s one strength ended up hurting it . \nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \nwhy ? \nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only "" everyone says i love you "" was able to make my heart sing . \n'",1
"b'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars "" . \nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \nin his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \nmurron\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \nwhat makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist . \nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \nhowever , even those who don\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\'t as effective as they should be . \nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \ndavid o\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \ncatherine mccormack as wallace\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of "" longshank "" \'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in "" politically correct "" hollywood . \nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \n'",1
"b'a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon ! \nhunter s . thompson\'s fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960\'s , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as "" gonzo "" . \nsoon after the book was written , hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke . \nand that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . ) \nalthough the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson\'s own assessment of the novel as "" unfilmable . "" \nthe main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road . \nit was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons , relatively sober , at his home . \nso although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor . \nhunter s . thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him . \nnot so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas . \ndespite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge . \nunfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp\'s ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration . \nand the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson\'s ) and his riding companion , dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned . \nthe film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs . \nfrom there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including one of the few good scenes in which depp , high on acid , watches all the people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards . \nwhile the movie has its moments ( few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts , especially towards the end . \ndespite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars never get off the ground . \nthe set decoration and costumes are great , and probably deserve an oscar nomination . \nhowever , as we all know , it\'s not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good . \n'",0
"b'the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . \nas a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin\'s character did it all for money . \nin his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . \nhe wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . \nplaying the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . \nthis con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . \nmaybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . \nbowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . \nmartin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . \nthe story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . \nin order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . \nthe only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . \nbut this won\'t stop the aggressive bowfinger . \nhe is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . \nhe has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . \nwill bowfinger be able to make his film ? \nor will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? \nbowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . \nthe only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . \nthis is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . \nbesides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . \nif you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . \nif you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . \n'",1
"b'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he\'d like to think so ) . \nhowever , he\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \nzero\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero\'s greatness as an investigator . \nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero\'s talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o\'neal ) . \nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown\'s greatness ) . \nzero effect , which is jake kasdan\'s first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it\'s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \nbut he didn\'t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven\'t seen from him since spaceballs . \nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \npullman\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n "" i\'ll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point . \n "" i have a gun , and everything . "" \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit\'s the kind of humor that\'s funny even after you\'ve seen it five or six times . \nthere\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won\'t appeal to everyone , but there\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\'s interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n'",1

"b""one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \nsometimes the stories are compelling . \nsometimes they're not . \nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . \nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . \nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \ni simply enjoyed the film . \ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \n""",1
"b'1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept "" . \nin summer 1994 , that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller "" . \nin few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . \nthe movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . \nhe comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . \nfew people except gaerity know the dove\'s violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . \ngaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove\'s colleagues , friends and relatives . \ndove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . \nwhile speed doesn\'t even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . \nand that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . \nbadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . \nscreenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . \nthe plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . \nthe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . \nthose questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . \nbecause of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . \nthe most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . \nhis acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . \nthis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . \nthe film have few bright points , though . \nsome of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . \nand forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove\'s colleague . \nbut , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor . \n'",0
"b'he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . \nshe inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . \nhe has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother\'s phrases . \nhe is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . \nhe is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . \nhe is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . \nhis father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . \nunsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out . \nhe is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . \nsoon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . \nbubby\'s relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . \nthe father\'s arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . \nbubby intuits from his father\'s arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . \nso far , so good . \nthe first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . \nthe movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby\'s hermetic two-room universe . \nit follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . \nit is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby\'s , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . \nhe observes what it might be like . \nthe intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch\'s eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . \nfor thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . \nthen de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . \nour unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . \nhe is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . \n . \n . \nit goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . \nde heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . \nthe scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby\'s experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother\'s walls , bubby dons a priest\'s collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . \nthe manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby\'s mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . \nalthough de heer\'s touch is at times overbearing , bubby\'s salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \ninnocence triumphs . \nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \nit\'s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn\'t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain\'t like other movies . \n'",1

"b'it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "" raising arizona "" and "" the hudsucker proxy , "" made their feature film debut with "" blood simple , "" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \nit bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens\' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \nthe premise of "" blood simple "" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \nemmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator\'s eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \nthis aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \nthe coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas . "" \nsome have labeled "" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \nthat said , "" blood simple "" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \nthat said , "" blood simple "" is not exactly flawless . \nfor one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \nand although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren\'t quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it\'s-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \n "" blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it\'s a decent movie and it showcases the coens\' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \ni would firmly recommend it to all "" coen-heads "" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \n'",1
"b' "" soldier "" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting . \nthe best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel\'s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision . \nbrutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little . \nthen it goes nowhere with that idea . \nthere is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i\'ve ever seen . \nthe whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it\'s been done much better . \ni was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn\'t be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting . \nbetween the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited . \nhis performance in that way isn\'t all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film . \nother performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters . \nbut enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? \nisn\'t the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? \neven in this aspect the film is a disappointment . \nin mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining . \nhowever , he fails to repeat that in this film . \nthe combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve . \nfighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize . \nbut instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s . \nif the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film . \nhowever , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . \n'",0
"b""the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . \nit's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . \nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? \njames foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . \nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . \nat least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . \nchow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . \nhe's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . \nthat's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . \nnick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . \nwhat happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . \ni'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . \ni'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . \ni'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . \nthere's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . \none of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . \ni don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . \ni'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . \none scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . \nhe's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . \n ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) \nthere are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . \nthere's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . \nthe plot itself never straightens out . \ni'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . \nthe corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . \nthe sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? \non that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? \none too many , i'd imagine . \nfoley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . \nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . \nchow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . \nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . \ni also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . \nbut the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . \na complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . \nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . \n""",0

"b'alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . \nkieslowski\'s blue , that is . \nwith its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers\' new independent film echoes the polish director\'s internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . \nlanguage aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character\'s world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm\'s length . \nas a result , while we\'re able to appreciate the film\'s intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . \nalchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" . \nwhile there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhen the film opens , she\'s living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . \nfollowing his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa\'s life is thrown into turmoil . \nevents swirls around her , and she can\'t find a source of stability . \nin her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend\'s mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult . \nalchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . \nin addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . \ndoes personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? \nare artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? \nmyers\' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . \nthrough louisa\'s struggles , she succeeds . \nwhile alchemy isn\'t always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . \neven when we\'re not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there\'s enough material on-screen to hold our attention . \nthe cinematography is stunning . \ncity scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film\'s early portions . \nlater , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we\'re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . \nit\'s a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa\'s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . \nthe title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul . \nand , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it\'s ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . \nher pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life\'s ultimate goal . \neven though louisa\'s final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it\'s still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . \nalchemy isn\'t pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it\'s close . \n'",1
"b""walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia . \nbut judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about . \ndisney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules . \nwith anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window . \nsome may say - so what ? \nit's just a kid's movie . \nwell . . . \nif you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way . \nconsider yourselves warned . \nnevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times . \ndon bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality . \nand yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . . \nwas this rushed to market to combat disney ? \nthe plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 . \nnot that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened . \nas for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe . \nyou'll see 60% of anastasia there . \n""",0
"b'you\'ve got to love disney . \nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it\'s animated . \nkids have to go see the movie . \nthen they have to get the toys . \noh , the video came out ? \ngot to buy it , or risk little billy\'s temper tantrums for the next month . \nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \nit\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \nwhat\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \nluckily , disney\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \nsoon , china\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china\'s defense . \nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points . \nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \nby leaving home to fight in her father\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \ni\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan\'s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga\'s voice translates much better to animation . \nyou have to hear it to understand . \ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale . \nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \nwhen mulan resolves to take her father\'s place , she dons her father\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \nit just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . "" \na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang\'s conscripted army . \neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \ni found the choice of b . d . \nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything\'s possible . \nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn\'t available . \nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \n'",1
"b'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \nslow is the best description for the film at first . \nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . \nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . \nthey laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . \nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . \nbut suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . \nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . \nthough the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . \nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\'t come across as a vanity piece . \none might wish he hadn\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\'s reactions so predictable . \nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \nin contrast , the son\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \nit\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \n'",1
"b'eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . \nas the movie\'s writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . \nbut at the same time , he\'ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . \nshould you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy\'s risky gamble ? \nwell , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . \nhere\'s what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time . \nthey gonna get sexy . \nthey gonna get funny . \nthey gonna get drama . \nthey gonna get all of that . \ni think it\'s the best movie i\'ve done "" ( paramount radio network ) . \nhere\'s what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor\'s career ( i haven\'t seen best defense ) . \nand guess who\'s to blame ? ! \nthe movie\'s problem is not murphy\'s direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film . \nno , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . \nmurphy\'s awful script is the culprit . \nlet\'s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : \n ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . \nyes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . \npractically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . \nand after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . \n ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . \nrichard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . \neach of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . \n ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . \nmurphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . \nbut when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it\'s another matter altogether . \nyou\'re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . \nfor instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . \nand he shoots jasmine guy in the head . \nthis is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! \nlovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn\'t have any scenes with murphy . \nthank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . \n ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . \nthe loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . \nmurphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . \nsometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . \n ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting . \nif you\'re going to make another sting movie , you\'ve got to do something original . \nmurphy\'s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . \n ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . \nyou know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . \n ( 7 ) murphy\'s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . \nfor what ? \nfor shooting reese\'s little toe off ! \nneedless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . \nin all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . \ndanny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . \naiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . \naiello\'s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . \nanother bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . \nin fact , hall\'s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . \nunfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . \nof course , i\'ve already mentioned that i didn\'t care for murphy\'s character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . \nthey are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . \n'",0

"b'the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don\'t count neil simon\'s biloxi blues ) . \nyear after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . \nbilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . \ni thought stripes would be different . \nwith ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . \ninstead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . \nmurray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . \nso he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . \nthe characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . \nall the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . \nhe only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . \nhe was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . \nas with a lot of the late 70\'s / early 80\'s comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . \ni\'m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition "" dear god !

"b'every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars "" sur-prise ! "" \ninto my bewildered visage . \nit\'s almost always a surprise . \nit sure as niflheim was this time . \namazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . \nand , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy , i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . \nanother e . t . \nanother short circuit . \nthis film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . \namerica has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin\' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . \namazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it\'s artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . \nthis is a very sturdy scenario . \nthe principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . \nthe writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the "" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen "" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! \nastounding ! \nhe uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! \ni am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it\'s so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . \ni don\'t want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . \nhis decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , "" amazing "" grace smith , and , well , i\'m leaving it at that because i wouldn\'t spoil this film for you for the world . \nlet me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . \ni don\'t give a rat\'s ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i\'m recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it\'s an excellent story , told with excellence . \nno , i don\'t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . \nthe point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . \nthis is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . \nit carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness . \nspecial kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing\'s manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is \n'",1

"b'well i guess it\'s that time of the year again . \nthe one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . \nit\'s also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . \nin america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year . \nand maybe it\'s the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like "" consider this a divorce , "" "" hasta la vista , baby , "" and "" you\'re the disease . \ni\'m the cure "" actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs . \nthis is not entirely a bad thing , of course . \nwhat am i talking about ? \ni\'m talking about the summer "" blockbusters , "" the "" action thrillers , "" the "" this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone\'s-going-to-go "" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . \nin the rash of "" my , what big guns you have , but wait ! \nmine are bigger "" movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of "" save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats "" offerings . \ni\'m talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i\'m talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . \nhere in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of "" my explosion is more real-looking than yours "" movies , but nothing else . \nmission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . \nthe same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . \nthat\'s saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the \'60s/\'70s . \nin eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . \nhe does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities . \nhis new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he\'s ever relocated , is "" an actual , real life honest person .

"b'robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it\'s in trouble . \njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically "" uplifting "" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn\'t realize it . \nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant "" heil hitler ! "" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob\'s ghetto . \nliberation ! he thinks . \nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren\'t met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \nthat\'s the film\'s biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \nit\'s never moving because it doesn\'t give us anything to be moved by . \njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \nrobin williams doesn\'t inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn\'t the robin williams we know and love . \nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \njakob the liar will be compared with last year\'s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a "" holocaust comedy "" . \nit\'s not a comedy . \nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \nis it a melodrama ? \na war movie ? \na character study ? \nno , no , and no . \njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can\'t be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \n'",0
"b'look ! the new version of "" psycho "" came out and the world didn\'t end ! \ni guess gus van sant really isn\'t the bringer of the apocalypse ! \nunfortunately , though , that "" psycho "" didn\'t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . \nvan sant\'s controversial "" re-telling "" of alfred hitchcock\'s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) \nwithout benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . \nbeing an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word "" suck "" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) \ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) \nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . \nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . \nsadly , that did not occur . \nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original "" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . \nin moore\'s case , the film would have been helped if "" the x- files "" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! \nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! \nmortensen ( who i liked in "" g . i . \njane "" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . \nsam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that\'s about it . \nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . \nanne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . \nat least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can\'t be said for most of the rest of the cast . \nthe best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama\'s boy , norman bates . \nhe\'s not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . \nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . \nthere is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . \nvan sant has made a boring film . \nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren\'t as eye-catching now . \nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don\'t impress or excite . \nvan sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) \nthese images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . \ndefinitely not hitchcock\'s intention ! \nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann\'s original famous and terrific score . \nif a film like "" psycho "" does not frighten , then what\'s the point . \naside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . \nthere are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting . \nin the end , however , the new "" psycho "" is a noble attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure . \n'",0
"b'if there\'s one thing i just can\'t stand , it\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \nhere\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here ) . \nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \nmaybe it will work for some people . \nit didn\'t work for me . \nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \nhe\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \nsam is broke . \nmax is dying . \npass the kleenex . \nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\'t believe that he\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\'t act very well . \nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \nsam\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\'s reunion with his family . \nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \nit\'s icky . \nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \ninstead , it\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \n'",0
"b""capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . \nthe gags are sporadically funny . \nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . \nthe plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . \nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . \nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . \nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . \n ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) \n , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \na film needs a plot . \nit needs characters for empathy value . \nit needs a story and an emotional center . \nif a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . \nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . \nwith dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . \npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . \nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . \nhis remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . \njay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . \nhow funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . \nfor me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . \nthere was not enough cleverness or variety . \nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . \npenis jokes work only so many times . \nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . \nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . \njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . \nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . \nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . \njay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . \nthis leaves them at loose ends . \nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . \nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . \nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . \nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood \nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . \nsilent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . \nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . \njay has to be the comic . \nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . \nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . \nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . \nso jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . \ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . \nlike dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . \ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . \nthey are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . \nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . \nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience . \ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n""",0
"b'don\'t get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson\'s naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood . \nhis 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997\'s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that\'s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings . \nbut his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself . \njovovich , besson\'s own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they\'ve since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) . \nand besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . \nleading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan\'s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side . \nbesson\'s big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject . \nyes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson\'s hallucinatory dream sequences . \nthe whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal . \nthat\'s kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness . \nthat darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she\'s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she\'s overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who\'s about to take a fall . \nas the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance . \ntrouble is , he\'s chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it\'s impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on . \nthis glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer\'s the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan\'s trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema . \ncompared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history . \n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa , 1999 \ntheatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 -------------------------------------------------------------- \n'",0
"b""the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . \neven though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . \nwriter/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . \ninstead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . \nno looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . \nthe most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . \nalas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . \nand , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . \npeeks of sunshine are few and far between . \nno wonder the characters are all so miserable . \nfirst of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . \nthat girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . \nthe two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other . \nclaudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . \nthen charlie re-enters the mix . \nso who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? \nwho cares ? ? \nno looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . \nso what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . \nthey aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . \nthey should know the ending as well as we do . \nand burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . \nanother frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . \nblythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance . \nsadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . \nnone of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . \nedward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . \njon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . \nthe worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . \nas portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love . \nburns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job . \nwhen he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) . \ntwo films and three short years later , the luster has faded . \nsome movie makers have only one good film in them . \nwith back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers , burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club . \n""",0
"b'david lynch\'s "" blue velvet "" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town . \nhowever , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a "" strange world "" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers . \nthe opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film . \nthey show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances . \nodd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story . \nthankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . \nsince its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next . \nthis is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising . \n "" blue velvet "" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting . \nlynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling . \nthe film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) . \nfrom this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping . \nthe plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch\'s story telling so amazing . \nmaclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends . \nthrough these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots . \nlynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion . \ninstead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times . \nlynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine . \nhowever , for fans of odd difficult indies , "" blue velvet "" could be just what they are looking for . \nit is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper\'s sadistic frank . \nmost of the other actors in the film were not very memorable . \nkyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality . \nlaura dern was consistently annoying . \nbut dennis hopper stole every scene he was in . \nhis evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask . \nfrank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon . \nmany producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy . \njust like his villain in "" speed "" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak . \nthis harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away . \n "" blue velvet "" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again . \nfor this sole reason it is recommended . \nbut also see it to admire lynch\'s obsession to avoid the norm . \neven if this film is a little too weird for you , it\'s hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it . \n'",1
"b""james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . \nnicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . \nhe's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . \nso , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v \nsitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . \nnaturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . \nlike good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . \nnicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . \nonly nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . \nhunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . \nthere's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . \nkinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character . \nalthough his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . \nin fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson . \nbut then again , pets are always cute on screen . \nproviding solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . \nhe overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . \nsmith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . \neven director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . \nbut this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it . \nhe's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . \nand this is the films main problem . \nit's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . \nshe doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . \nalso , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . \ni would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . \nit would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . \nbrooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . \nhe handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good . \nthere's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . \nbut , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . \nthe movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . \noverall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) \nnot quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun . \n""",1
"b'overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson\'s novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson . \nhe is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . \nhe drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience\'s patience . \ni know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? \nthe original was a great psychological horror film . \nthis new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . \nin fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . \nunless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there\'s nothing in this film that will raise hackles . \ni nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn\'t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . \nit\'s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . \nowen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . \ncatherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . \nliam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what\'s going on as the rest of them do . \nfinally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . \napparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor\'s characters was filmed but removed . \nthat\'s too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . \nthis is jan de bont\'s second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . \nwhen is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? \nrobert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . \none should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . \nif de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . \nwhat our mind fashions on it\'s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . \napparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it\'s original title . \ni certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont\'s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had . \n[pg-13] \n'",0

"b""modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . \nadapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . \nliam neeson stars as jean valjean . \nas a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . \nprison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . \nhowever , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . \nhowever , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . \ninspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . \nhe has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . \nhe once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . \ntwo women also get caught up in the struggle . \nfantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . \nher daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . \ninstead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . \ndirector bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . \nhopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . \nthe movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . \nthe experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . \nneeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . \nthe supporting cast is also extraordinary . \nthe only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . \nthe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . \nthe novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . \nwhile it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . \nit , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . \n""",1
"b'no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . \ni\'m referring , specifically , to the narrative form . \nin the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . \nsaid story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . \nwhen the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . \nthroughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film ) . \nbut there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . \nwe finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . \na horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . \nthe fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . \ni have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan\'s heavy- handedness behind the camera . \nfor the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . \nbut that\'s just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . \nalso , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . \nperhaps it wouldn\'t feel so contrived if it weren\'t shot in such a tasteful manner . \nthere are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . \ni was half-right . \nnevertheless it\'s worth-seeing . \nthe delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . \nthe sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it\'s not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . \negoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . \nthough i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter . \n'",1
"b""`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . \ncertain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . \ni chuckled incessantly , all the way home . \nlet me share . \nthe skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . \nluke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . \ndespite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . \nsoon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . \nyeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? \nbut luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . \nthe premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . \nunfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . \nit's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . \nbut not the script . \n`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . \nfirst off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . \nafterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . \nwill they never take this watch off ? \nand what if they forget it by their bedside ? \nperhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . \non top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . \ngee , why not member t-shirts ? \nbut my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions . \nthey are given official skull paddles . \nwhen flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . \nfacing the opposite way means a disagreement . \nwouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? \nhell no . \nthey have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . \ni'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . \nthe cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . \nbut not entirely . \naccomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . \nand then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . \nmcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . \ni pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors . \nthe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . \nlet's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . \npaul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son . \nwalker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room !

"b'warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . \nbased on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . \nbeatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who\'s going through a nervous breakdown . \nafter hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what\'s _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) \ninstead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . \nhowever , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . \nand he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) \nit\'s remarkable that this film was released at all . \nmuch more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . \nthe outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . \nit\'s great that beatty isn\'t afraid to let loose on a subject . \ntalking of beatty , he\'s excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . \nand seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . \neven in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . \n ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) \nthe film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) \nand seeing beatty as a \'homeboy\' has to be seen to be believed . \nit\'s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . \nsecond best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . \nhalle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . \nalso popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she\'s also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . \nand , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . \nthe writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . \nthe direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . \nthe script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . \nthey\'re not cringe inducing , at least . \nthe script makes many points about society in america today , and isn\'t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . \nbest of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . \nthere\'s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . \nbulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . \nperhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it\'s irrelevant . \nin fact , there\'s very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . \nbulworth , then , is well worth watching . \na david wilcock review ? 1999 \n "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes \n'",1
"b'the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . \ni know that is very sweeping statement , so i\'ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . \n2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . \nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . \nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . \nsomething bad happens to them . \npictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . \napparently everyone in the town is dead . \nthe authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . \ntwo of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . \nsome went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . \nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . \nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . \ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . \nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . \nthey barely call off the bombing in time . \nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . \nthis triggers the lab\'s last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . \nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . \nmuch of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . \nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . \nthe performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . \nto me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . \nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don\'t expect . \nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . \nit was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body\'s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . \n'",1
"b'with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! "" \n ( actually , it\'s "" lock and load "" ) , you can\'t help thinking tarantino . \nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . \nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \n "" inspired by true events "" -- we\'ve heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . \nor so strangely poignant . \nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . \nbeginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . \nthey fall in love and marry , but pam\'s increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . \nwhen chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . \nthen , chris begins to rob banks . . . \nluke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . \nmoustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . \n ( it\'s another of john mcnaughton\'s coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . \nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . \nif the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it\'s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . \nas in those movies , there\'s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . \njudd doesn\'t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam\'s \'craziness\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \'normal\' chris . \nwhen pam reacts to her father-in-law\'s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris\' face is the picture of pained restraint . \nof course , it\'s the question of what is \'normal\' that is asked in normal life . \nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . \nit is the rational chris that loves guns ( "" shooting is about precision , control "" ) and the \'crazy\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- "" chaos and you and me . . . \nwe\'re a real family "" , she notes wryly ) . \nit is chris\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . \nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : "" buy-more "" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . \nit\'s not a perfect film . \nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . \nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \nindeed , as in mcnaughton\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \'realistic\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \nin its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick\'s badlands . \nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malick\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \'normal life\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . \nbut these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \'normal\' , conventional world . \npam\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",1

"b'the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs . \nkramer "" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \nhe\'s screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter . \nnow , i\'m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \njack is in even worse shape than harry . \nhe\'s dying of cancer with only a year to live . \nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine\'s first husband 20 years before . \nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel\'s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross\'s former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \nit\'s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \nby the time they show you , it doesn\'t matter . \nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross\'s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it\'s not explained or i didn\'t care enough at that point to remember . \na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \nit\'s also not funny , doesn\'t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \non the positive side , it\'s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn\'t seem quite suited to the dark film style . \nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can\'t pull the film out of the hole it\'s dug for itself . \njames garner who plays ross\'s old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like "" i\'m glad they didn\'t shoot your pecker off . "" \nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \nthe film doesn\'t run very long before the audience realizes that it\'s hopeless . \nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \nit reminds me of disaster movies such as "" towering inferno "" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film\'s problems . \nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \nof course , we don\'t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \n'",0
"b'the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . \nbeing a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take . \nthus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . \nplush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy\'s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing . \ntoo late . \nthis is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn\'t even come to a fraction of it . \ni shouldn\'t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors\' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm . \nconsider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral . \nimagine with me , if you will , _scream_\'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2 . \n ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals . \n ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy . \n ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that\'s cute . \n ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that\'s cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition . \n ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that\'ll do , pig . \nthat\'ll do .

"b""jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe's mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . \nthere's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . \n""",1
"b""the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \ngriffith . \ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \n""",1
"b'when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" \nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears\' 1988 masterpiece . \nimagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . \nand i was impressed . \nin fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . \nit\'s kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . \ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they\'re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . \ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . \ni also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . \nphillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . \nwow . \nisn\'t that a memorable name ? \ni could just say it over and over again . \nsebastian valmont . \nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can\'t have , no material object out of his reach . \nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don\'t really exist . \nthe ones who do are irritating . \nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \nbut it\'s too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty . "" \nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \nbut -- dear god ! \n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn\'t the moral staple she\'s supposed to be : sure , she won\'t have sex until she\'s in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \nbut i can\'t forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \nand there\'s one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn\'t help that he has no character to work with . \nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \nthe film fails in every other way , too . \nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \neven the "" intellectuals "" i know don\'t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there\'s no way we can join it . \ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \nso , if we hate them , then what\'s the point of an extended sex scene ? \ntitillation , of course . \nit can\'t even work under the pretense of "" meaningful love scene , "" because we hate the characters . \nit\'s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears\' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \nbut kids don\'t act like this . \nnobody acts like this . \nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it\'s really deep and profound . \ni\'ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s awful . \n'",0
"b'the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer\'s other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and "" rambo "" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it\'s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here\'s what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan\'s army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can\'t be the evil superdemon he\'s expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn\'s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don\'t have a single scene together before simmons\' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody\'s guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \nso many questions are left unanswered , and i\'m sure they won\'t be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \nwhile last year\'s the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven\'t the faintest idea how to make a movie . \n'",0

"b""i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price . \nas the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking . \njason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e . \nthe fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion . \nthis stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) . \nhe funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross . \nrosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross . \nherman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this . \nbut eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love . \nthe academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) . \nit maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub . \nthe entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic . \nthe cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well . \ni hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers . \n""",1

"b'dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . \nalthough dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one "" dead bore . "" \nin the film , johnson plays . . . \nyou guessed it . . . \na cop . \nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on "" miami vice . "" \na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \nbeck\'s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \nshe will not even allow him to wish them "" merry christmas "" by telephone . \nbut beck\'s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \nthe movie depicts beck\'s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang\'s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \naccording to the movie\'s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who\'s offended by beck\'s foul language and unorthodox methods . \nforsythe\'s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( "" wkrp in cincinnati "" and "" frank\'s place "" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \nthe sole function of penelope ann miller\'s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \ni guess the film\'s title refers to this love scene since it\'s definitely a dead bang . \nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie\'s pitiful script . \njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie\'s in trouble . \nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can\'t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \n'",0
"b""it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . \nof course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . \npayback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . \nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . \nall we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . \nit turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . \nobviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . \nporter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . \ngibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . \nyou probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . \nharrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? \nthis is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . \nwhile he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . \nporter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . \npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . \nthe only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? \nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . \nthe film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . \na fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . \njust be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . \n""",1

"b'renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . \nthe film follows potter\'s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . \nhe also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort . "" \nthe tale has resnais\'s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . \nit is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone\'s heart for every occasion . \nwhat hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . \nyet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . \nalso , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . \nit also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . \nit tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . \nthey are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . \nshe is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . \nshe once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . \nsimon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . \nsimon\'s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . \nscreenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . \njaoui\'s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . \nin history , using for her thesis the study of \'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \' \nshe works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . \non her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . \nto his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister\'s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he\'s so sensitive . \nbacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . \nhe is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . \nodile still pines for him , but he\'s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . \nlove is \'the same old song\' that makes the world go \'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . \neverything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile\'s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . \nthere\'s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . \nthis film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . \nit not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . \nit is also interesting in the way it examines its characters\' behavior as being similar in business as in love . \n'",1

"" \nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . \nhe\'s not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don\'t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and "" the thirteenth warrior "" wisely doesn\'t pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . \nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there\'s still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . \nit isn\'t the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( "" funny girl "" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic "" indiana jones and the temple of doom "" -esque chase through the villains\' underground lair . \nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between "" die hard "" -helmer mctiernan and "" jurrasic park "" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . \nheard during "" the thirteenth warrior "" \'s final scene : a dog whimpering . \nhow appropriate . \n'",0
"b'often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . \nmany elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don\'t convert into a solid work . \nalthough a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . \nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . \nthe community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . \nover time , the people have taken to themselves . \nthe town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . \nso what happens when a "" tourist "" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? \nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . \nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . \nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . \nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . \nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town\'s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance\'s involvement with this musician . \nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . \nit features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . \ntechnically , this film is a nightmare . \nthe music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . \nthe lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . \nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . \nin addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . \nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one\'s patience . \nthe film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . \nthere was , however , potential for this film . \nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . \nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie . \nperhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . \nmost importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren\'t such a bore . \nuntil then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out "" mommy "" while he wanders astray in a park . \n'",0
"b'for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . \nbut while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . \nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . \nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . \nthen , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . \nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie\'s brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . \nraymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . \nbut these are the least of billy\'s problems . \nbilly is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn\'t seem that he\'ll last much longer . \nbilly and valerie\'s mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond\'s nemesis . \nshe disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . \nshe merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . \nif this description seems bleak , i haven\'t told the half of it . \nthis is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it\'s downright depressing . \nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it\'s not quite worth it . \nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . \ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billy\'s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . \nthe film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything . \ngranted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . \nthe actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . \nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . \nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there\'s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . \na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . \noldman got it about half right . \n'",0

"b'a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . \nwhat is the point of this ? \ni do not know , but i wish it hadn\'t been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year\'s worst film so far . \nto attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . \nwing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . \nthe trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . \nmany people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . \ni found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . \nit is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . \nfreddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . \nwing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . \nthis was definitely his worst performance to date . \nafter january\'s she\'s all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . \n ( for now anyway . ) \nchristopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . \nblair\'s parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . \nhis parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . \nblair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard . \nmatthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . \nhis character as stu in 1996\'s scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . \nthe three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . \nthis plot is very flimsy , and doesn\'t give a whole lot to work with at all . \nthis explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . \nthe acting is horrible in wing commander . \nmany lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . \nthe acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . \nthe other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . \nthe special effects are very unrealistic . \nwhen looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . \nthe explosions look very unrealistic as well . \na ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . \nthis is very unrealistic . \nmusic pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . \nthe music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . \nafter we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . \nblair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . \nfor the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . \nit is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . \nit\'s not much fun to watch at all . \nif i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . \nat least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . \nthe bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox ! \n'",0

"b'you\'d think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . \nthat\'s a bit more difficult . \nthe farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . \nif you\'re not nice to it , you lose . \ngalaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks\'s spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . \n "" the show\'s been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . "" \nthat is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that\'s no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . \nit also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show\'s obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . \njason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . \nthe attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . \ndane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character\'s cheesy trademark line "" by grabthar\'s hammer , you shall be avenged "" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . \none day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "" galaxy quest "" followers . \nthey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . \nthey have mistaken the "" galaxy quest "" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . \nthe next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film\'s only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . \nnesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . \nnext thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . \nof course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . \nbut after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . \ni was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . \ntaking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . \nnothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . \nthe highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub\'s fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . \nwhile scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell "" i need more power down here captain !

"" \n- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? \nred , white , and blue ? \nhuh ? \nhuh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . \nthe film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . \ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . \nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . \n "" the doom generation "" doesn\'t want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . \nhe wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . \nhere\'s one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . \namy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . \nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note . \nhe points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . \njordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . \nthe cash register rings up "" 6 . 66 "" \n ( oh , and this symbolism doesn\'t stop here ) . \njordan checks for his wallet but it\'s really in the car . \nhe asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . \nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . \nthey say they don\'t have it . \nhe gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk\'s head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . \nthe head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . \ni don\'t really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . \naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he\'ll make some kind of art . \nwrong . \nit takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . \nwhen george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . \nsame goes for peter jackson\'s disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . \nit was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . \na scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . \nhere\'s a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . \nalso , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn\'t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o\'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn\'t when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) . \npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . \nwhy are they here ? \nso that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it\'s ( fill in the blank ) ! \nwow !

"" \nand then there\'s james duval . \nlet\'s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . \nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world . "" \ni have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . \nor at least somewhere up there . \nhere\'s another example of a bad scene , if you\'re still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they\'re playing nine inch nail\'s most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines : "" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i\'ll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . \nthe film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck . "" \nno explanation of this should be necessary . \nand finally , a note to gregg : grow up . \nreally . \nmove out of your parent\'s basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . \nand don\'t quit it . \n'",0
"b""sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . \na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . \nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \nthat isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \nusing peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . \neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \nbut the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . \nfirst of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . \nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \n""",0
"b'the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . \npeople may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . \nfive concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg\'s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . \nthe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . \nas the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . \nin 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany\'s reach , and they became the last target of hitler\'s "" final solution . "" \neach of the five tells his or her story . \ntheir stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . \nthey recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . \nthey recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . \neach recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . \nand finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . \nneedless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . \nby themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . \nthe last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it\'s mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . \nin this kind of movie it\'s almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects\' narration . \nthe liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . \nit\'s not clear which scene it is . \nit could be one of two that i hadn\'t seen before , both powerful . \none is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . \nthere is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . \nanother segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . \nthere has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . \nbut by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . \nand i\'m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . \nthe transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . \nx-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . \nalso , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , \nso the richness and detail are impeccable . \nthe dvd\'s features are plentiful and well-chosen . \nthere is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . \nthere are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . \nalso , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . \none of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . \nyou\'d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they\'re not bloopers . \ninstead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . \none of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . \nrenee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . \nfirestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . \nthe doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . \nanother of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . \nhe ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving .

"b""there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \n""",1
"b""i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . \nthe last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . \nhowever , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . \nboth films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . \neven better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . \neveryone loves surprises . \nu-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . \nthis may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . \nset during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . \nthere's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . \nit is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . \nthe film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . \nonce the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . \nas soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . \nthis is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all . \nthe best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . \nthroughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible . \ngermans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . \nall of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move . \nthey also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while . \n""",1
"b'capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . \nthe script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . \nthe characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . \nthis is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \njalla ! jalla ! \nis basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen . \nit tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love . \nthe film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background . \nthey spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs . \nroro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem . \nroro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems . \nit seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . \nyasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either . \nmans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . \nthe two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . \nmans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . \nthe one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . \nroro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding . \nnot too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . \nthe plot turns in several places are contrived . \none knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . \nlebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . \nwhen things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story . \nfor example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . \ncharacterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . \nwe do see some of roro\'s family life and his concerns . \nthat may be because roro\'s background is a lot like that of the director . \nwhile the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film . \nit was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life . \none does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this . \ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",0
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit\'s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor\'s first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . \nany hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film\'s latter half . \nthe film\'s central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . \nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . \nnick casually asks for terry\'s wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . \nof course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . \nlearning of nick\'s condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry\'s compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick\'s lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry\'s death wish by killing him . \nthis is a promising premise , and mr . taylor\'s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . \nthis is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . \nhowever , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . \nunfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film\'s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . \nfar from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . \nmr . taylor\'s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as "" you should have asked something more interesting , like \'do you enjoy the pain ? \' \n- see , that\'s provocative , leaves room for further questions . "" ) \nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick\'s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . \nthis occurs particularly often during the film\'s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i\'m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it\'s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick\'s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . \nthe entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . \namong the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang\'s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . \nmr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . \nthe charge of dream with the fishes\'s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . \nfor dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . \n'",0
"b'for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . \ndespite it\'s lurid subject matter and it\'s passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . \nfreshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . \nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia . \njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . \njasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . \nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . \nthis is a couple that has it all . \ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust . \ndespite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . \na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine\'s concerns . \nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine\'s dismay . \nas jermaine puts it , "" don\'t you want to be sexually free ? "" \njermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . \nthe woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . \njade , at one point was a college student , too . \nunlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . \nto further reinforce their differences , it\'s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . \ninevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine\'s part , the forbidden act is consummated . \nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine\'s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . \nby this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . \nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . \njermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . \njasmine is bland and subservient . \njade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . \nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive "" dog "" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . \nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? \nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . \nas it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . \n'",0
"b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \nspielberg\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \nthere\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments . "" \nanother aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \n "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "" \nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "" \nor some variant thereof . \nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \n . \n'",0
"b""you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . \nit's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . \nas youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . \nwhile their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . \nbut tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . \nnow adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . \nthe likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . \non the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' . \nin the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . \neverything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . \nnow a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . \nwith these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . \npredicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . \nedward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' . \nafter shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . \nnot in the least . \nnorton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . \nweighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . \nin addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . \nstiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . \nelfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . \nthe remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . \n`keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . . \nthough perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . \nthere is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . \nonce the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . \nstiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . \nwe enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . \nthis is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . \nnonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience . \n`keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . \naww , what the hell . \nthe quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . \n""",1

"b'contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan\'s only novel . \nit details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . \nwe first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . \nher research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications . \nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . \nhadden ( john hurt ) . \nthen , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . \nin the movie\'s most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . \nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . \nfurther decoding , with hadden\'s help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . \nit appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens\' home world . \nof course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" \n ( right after "" who\'s gonna pay for this thing ? "" ) . \nto boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . \ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that ) . \nthen hadden reappears with startling news . \nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . \nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . \nwhen she returns home , no one believes her . \nshe was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . \nher story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don\'t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . \n . \n . \neighteen hours worth of static ) . \nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . \nellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . \nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that\'s a tough standard to meet . \nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . \nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . \ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . \nhadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . \neven palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie\'s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . \nthe film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . \nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . \nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . \nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . \nthe film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . \nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures . \nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . \nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . \nthe only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . \ni can\'t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . \nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . \nthe film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . \nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . \nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . \nwhat ellie should have said was , "" you shouldn\'t believe me . \nnot without evidence , and i don\'t have the evidence . \ni know what happened but you shouldn\'t take my word alone . "" \nthat is the voice of science speaking . \nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . \nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . \nalso , his profession of "" faith "" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . \nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . \nthe media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren\'t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . \nthe use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . \nfirst of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . \nalso , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . \npeople watching this film in the future will say , "" hey , this never took place during clinton\'s term .

"b""did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? \nthat is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . \nshe is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . \nthe dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . \njeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . \nhe is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . \nhis remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . \nthe background to the case is such . \nduring christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . \nthe same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . \nwhen examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . \nclaus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . \nhe immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . \nron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . \nwe follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . \ndershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . \nnevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . \ntogether with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . \nsilver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . \nschroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . \nthere are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . \nyet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . \nthe flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . \nthe movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . \nthe film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . \nthe supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . \nyet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . \nas von bulow , he is brutally evil . \nanti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . \nirons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . \nhe is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . \nhowever , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . \nthere is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . \nhowever , legally , did he do the murder ? \nschroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . \nwith all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . \nschroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . \nfor all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . \nwe don't know what happened . \nthat sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . \nin the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . \nirons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good . \n""",1
"b""after a stylistic detour with mrs . \nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n""",1

"b'it\'s a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it . \nsuch is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . \nthough the blurb alludes to "" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , "" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa . \nhe hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) . \nthey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal , which subsequently falls through . \ncongo escapes , finds endo\'s ancestor\'s sword , and comes back , guns blazing , to free the rest of them , and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword . \nthe end . \n_the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable . \nit is merely _there_ . \nthe murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated , subplots that are never explained , and many scenes that make very little sense at all . \nthe film is shot through with all the tired old "" inscrutable japanese samurai "" and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie . \nit is quite slow-paced , with only a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic . \nmost of the acting is fair , with the possible exception of congo\'s girlfriend . \nlance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self , and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie . \nthe only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery . \ni paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it . \nif you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie . \nskip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan . \n'",0
"b' * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling\'s latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . \nwhen she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it\'s impossible to tell whether she\'s being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . \nsuch is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . \nthis fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who\'s talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . \nhas anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari\'s dora ? \nattired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . \nthe mechanics of loser\'s tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . \nthey become walking wardrobes . \nsmall-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter\'s cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn\'t scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . \nhe has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . \nthough they\'re not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . \n ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . \ndora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . \nunfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) \nwhen paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . \nalthough paul\'s already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . \nshe\'s thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul\'s to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" ) , and just when paul\'s got in his head that she\'s starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott\'s live-in girlfriend . \ncue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . \n ( aside : simon & garfunkel\'s "" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme "" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) \nheckerling has a lot in common with nora "" you\'ve got mail "" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . \nmen continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she\'s cheerily redecorating his apartment . \n ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) \ngoth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . \nheckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling\'s social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . \n ( consider , too , that dora is the film\'s sole female principal . ) \nnot that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn\'t . \nthat is her hallmark . \n ( --- for more first-run , dvd , and books-about-movies reviews , plus contests and the proverbial "" more !

"b'finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task . \nsummoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job . \nif you\'re a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you . \nmelvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be . \na solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible . \nhis obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk . \n ( there\'s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles . ) \nmelvin has some great lines . \nwhen his publisher\'s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . "" \ndon\'t get him wrong , he\'s not merely a misogynist . \nsetting his sights higher than that , he\'s also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors . \nwhen we first meet him , he\'s busy dumping a neighbor\'s dog down the garbage chute . \nhe\'s an equal opportunity bigot . \nhe does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe . \nmelvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him . \nand she\'s none too happy about it . \nwhen carol doesn\'t show up for work , melvin\'s routine is shot and he\'s determined to do something about it . \ntracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast . \nthe fact that she\'s a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn\'t appear to phase him , he wants his food . \nmuch more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery . \nthis doesn\'t upset melvin much ( "" don\'t worry , you\'ll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon\'s dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey . \nmelvin is sequestered because he\'s afraid of what\'s out there on the other side of his apartment door . \nhe has to make sure it\'s ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side . \nwhen he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes . \nthis little crack in his emotional armor opens him up . \nhiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son . \nhe even develops a friendship with simon . \nall three people are heavily damaged . \nmelvin has retreated from life in his apartment . \ncarol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him . \nsimon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out . \na more unlikely trio to form relationships , you\'d rarely see . \nand in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments . \nmelvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice . \n "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her . \none of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon . \ncarol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him . \nit only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest . \nthere\'s hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson . \ni don\'t remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment . \nnicholson may be the best actor working today . \nhunt does a commendable job matching nicholson\'s energy . \nshe isn\'t afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch . \ntheir on-screen chemistry is a bit odd . \neach does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there\'s something a little off . \nit\'s a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film . \ndirector james l . brooks ( "" terms of endearment "" , "" broadcast news "" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands . \n "" as good as it gets "" isn\'t exactly the quality that the title says , but it\'s pretty darn close . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one , he\'s off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm . \nthis year it\'s in the sixties and raining . \nthat wacky el nino . ) \n'",1
"b'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\'s most likely just another way of referring to "" sex "" . \ni think we\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \nit\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \nit\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \nhis characters don\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \nthey voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence "" . \nhuh ? \nand yes that is as complex as this movie\'s observations get . \nthe characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . \nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . \nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . \ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . \ni\'m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . \nwith the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . \ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" ) . \nin between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . \nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . \nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . \nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don\'t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . \nadditionally that one side isn\'t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . \nor realism . \none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . \nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\'t it erotic , it isn\'t real . \nit doesn\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\'s next to wall street . \nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \nhe gave them heart . \ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \nthis is not the way to get any message across . \nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\' skins ? \ncristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . \n'",0
"b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \nbut the right stuff film isn\'t even fiction . \nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \nten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age . \nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \nin one of critics\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects . \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \nshepard\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\' wives . \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\'s superb direction . \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \nin that setting , it\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \nanother fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \nsome of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \nfilm also lacks proper closure . \non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\'s america . \nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \ntime has passed ; now we don\'t see astronauts as heroes . \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times "" when future began "" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow "" mercury "" astronauts\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \n'",1
"b'the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . \nall three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn\'t , and if our world is just a huge game . \nthe thirteenth floor doesn\'t reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . \nin the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . \nin existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . \nin the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . \nthere is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . \nthe thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn\'t expect it to take , and i\'m not very sure it was such a great turn to make . \nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . \nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . \nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . \nall of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? \ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . \nalong the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . \nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn\'t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer\'s interests . \ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn\'t enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . \nunfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . \nthe scenes that aren\'t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , "" what is the point of this ? "" \nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . \ni know this isn\'t a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . \non the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . \nin the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . \nanother plus is gretchen mol\'s realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . \ndon\'t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . \nthrills , chills , and spills aren\'t what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you\'ve had enough . \nthe bottom line- let\'s hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile . \n'",1
"b' "" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , "" \nscreams the television ads for "" hanging up , "" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . \nmake me laugh again ! \nnot only is "" hanging up "" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don\'t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes . \nand we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? \nexcuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . \neve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . \nher elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer\'s ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . \nwhile eve\'s relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up\'s and down\'s with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . \nher older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . \ninterestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . \nmaddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . \nand they talk . \nand talk . \nand talk . . . \nin fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . \nif you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . \nthe question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? \nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn\'t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \nyou think to yourself : "" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , "" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\'s "" hurlyburly "" or 1994\'s "" when a man loves a woman "" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \nwith "" hanging up , "" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn\'t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son\'s birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan\'s senior . \nyeah , right . \nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999\'s "" analyze this .

"b""i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \nwish me luck . \nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \n""",0
"b'alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn\'t like it . \nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \njames cameron\'s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn\'t see . \nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \ndon\'t get me wrong--i\'m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \nas a result , alien 3\'s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \n ( title ) . . . \na shot of an alien egg . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nand so on and so on . \nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \nit\'s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog\'s demise . \nit\'s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \nmany people have criticized fincher\'s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn\'t want to see die ) . \nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don\'t plan on spoiling that in this review . \n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane\'s stomach . \nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \nwhy it doesn\'t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \nmany critics didn\'t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher\'s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that\'s not always a bad thing . \nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron\'s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that\'s what is important . \nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \nwhile cameron\'s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \nher

"b'ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . \nbruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . \nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the film\'s tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . \nfollowed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . \nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it\'s original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . \nthe disc contains two versions of the film\'s audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . \nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film\'s star , bruce campbell . \ncampbell\'s commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . \nsuch informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it\'s title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . \nalso , there\'s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they\'ve found that\'s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . \nfor that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . \nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor\'s had never smoked before , and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene . \ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . \nthe two people you\'d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . \ndon\'t get me wrong here , when they do speak it\'s entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . \nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? "" \nto me , that\'s not a good sign . \nalso , it seems like sam raimi doesn\'t remember much about the film and it\'s production . . . \nwell , compared to rob and bruce anyway . \nalso included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film\'s "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . \nthis raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . \noverall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it\'s genre . \nand the collector\'s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you\'re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . \nall special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . \n'",1

"b' "" a breed apart "" casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner . \na bit hard to swallow ? \nthat\'s only the first of many improbabilities in this film . \nhauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector . \nturner is the woman caught between the two men . \n "" a breed apart "" isn\'t a bad movie , exactly . \nindeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn\'t be more different . \nthe problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies . \nfor example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at "" his "" birds . \nlater on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them . \ni have a tough time believing that the police wouldn\'t get involved at that point . \nanother problem is the silly love-triangle that develops . \ni didn\'t care one way or the other who ended up with turner . \ni was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions . \nhowever , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there\'s more to life than money and birds . \nas for hauer , he\'s an actor i\'ve always admired . \nhe has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters . \nand this one is no exception . \nhe\'s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate\'s clothing , and holstering a cross-bow . \ndespite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through . \nfor example , there\'s a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early . \nhe comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions . \nsoon after , we find out he\'s a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us . \n "" a breed apart "" isn\'t a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it\'s worth seeing for that reason alone . \n'",1
"b'in the continuation of warner brother\'s franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . \nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . \navika goldsman\'s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . \nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . \nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . \nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone\'s batgirl , who just happens to be alfred\'s niece . \nthe story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . \nwhile working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . \nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . \nnow the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . \nif mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . \nthis is indeed a cold hearted man . \nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . \nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . \nshe joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . \nthe characters have no logic . \nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . \nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . \ngeorge clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . \nto say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . \nhis best performances are still on "" e . r .

"b'what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" \nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \'60s tv series ) . \non one hand , nicholson\'s joker is extremely funny . \nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \nthe joker\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \nkeaton delivers . \nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke . "" \nburton\'s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . \nthe sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . \nnicholson isn\'t joking when he boasts , "" wait \'till they get a load of me ! "" \nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \nkeaton\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \nbatman\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\'s outfit in robocop . \nproduction designer anton furst\'s sets are a wonder . \ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \nthe movie\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \n'",1

which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . \nthis is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . \ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . \nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . \nor so it would seem . \nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in

describing his every move . \nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . \nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . \nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . \nin many ways , mr . niccol\'s screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . \nalthough the film\'s rather conventional climax doesn\'t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . \ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . \nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . \nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . \nthe system formula . \nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . \nthe device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman\'s growing awareness isn\'t exactly convincing . \nthere\'s not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . \nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman\'s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . \nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . \ni\'ve always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . \ncheerfully going over the top , it\'s hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she\'d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? \nms . linney is a delight in the film . \nbut it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . \nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it\'s difficult not to root for truman . \nin a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there\'s an early scene where he\'s down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . \nit\'s almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who\'s constantly the centre of attention . \nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman\'s antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz\'s original score . \ntechnical credits are first-rate all around . \nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it\'s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965\'s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . \nall the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . \nthe curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film\'s concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it\'s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . \nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . \nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world . \n'",1

"b""when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . \ntoss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . \nthis , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans . \nthus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . \ndirected by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . \npaulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young . \ni got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . \nfor those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . \nthe acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . \ngrainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . \nconfusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . \nquite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . \nwhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? \nanother scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . \nin retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . \nthis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . \nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . \none , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . \nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . \ncertainly she had to endure a miserable life . \nbut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . \ni felt trapped in the theater watching it . \nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . \npaulina runs 1 : 28 . \nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles . \nit is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \n""",0
"b'by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard\'s ransom . \ngibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . \ntom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . \nminutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom\'s house and wiring every phone . \nthe plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you\'ve already seen , and it was nothing more than that . \nthat is until about half-way through the movie . \nsuddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom . \nbut this is as close as you will ever get to it . \ninstead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive .

"" \nthe result is a mix of genres that don\'t mesh well . \nelements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d\'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . \nthe result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd . \nalexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . \nthe real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d\'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . \nchambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o\'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . \nsuvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . \nif "" the musketeer "" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . \nstronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . \nthe supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . \ncatherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d\'artagnan\'s mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in "" the princess bride ) . \nstephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . \ntim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal\'s chief henchman , febre . \nhe is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . \nthe rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d\'artagnan\'s aid when needed . \npeter hyam\'s does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . \na stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . \nphotography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d\'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre\'s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d\'artagnan\'s folks years before . \nit is all routine stuff . \nthe renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . \nit works in a sci-fi film like "" the matrix "" or in a classical fantasy like "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" but just calls attention to itself in "" the musketeer .

"b'my first press screening of 1998 and already i\'ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves\'s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year\'s crop of movies . \nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . "" \nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . "" \nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can\'t get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl\'s face . \nour show\'s two heroes , the crew\'s chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica\'s two firefighting buddies ? \nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth\'s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \n ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building\'s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \nwhen the film isn\'t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it\'s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms .

"b""to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . \nthe mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . \nmulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , \nmulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . \nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \nthe emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . \nmulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . \nmulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . \nyet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . \nthe movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . \nwong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . \nalso adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . \nhis fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . \nthe movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . \nthe music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . \nthe overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . \nmulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . \nat about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . \nmulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . \nalso , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . \nit would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n""",1
"b""would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? \nlet me tell you what reality is . \nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . \nthat's reality . \namerica's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . \nthe plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . \nthe only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . \ngosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . \nveteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . \n ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) \nand did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? \nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? \noh billy , you're a scamp ! \nthe script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? \nand bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . \nyes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! \nif you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . \nit's about to expire . \naside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , \namerica's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . \ni didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . \nbad move , billy -- your jokes suck . \nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . \njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . \nobviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . \nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . \nas for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . \nhe's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . \nit'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . \ni could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . \ninstead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . \nevery single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . \nwhen you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? \n""",0
"b'i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . \nwhen the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn\'t hear one negative comment , and i didn\'t have any to offer . \nsimon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . \nsimon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . \nsurprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . \nsimon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn\'t know what . \njoe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who\'s mom ( ashley judd ) won\'t tell him who his father is . \nsimon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don\'t really like him , because he isn\'t "" natural "" . \neven his own parents don\'t care about him , and are disappointed they didn\'t have a "" normal "" son . \nhe is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon\'s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . \nthe only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe\'s mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . \nit would be just simon\'s luck , that he would accidentally kills joe\'s mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . \njoe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . \nwith the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe\'s mom\'s current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . \nmost of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . \nsimon will also look for god\'s plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . \nstarring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood\'s newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . \njim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . \nthis is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . \nsimon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . \nhe does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film\'s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . \nthe dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . \nthe cast is excellent . \njoseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . \njoseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . \nian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . \nother great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . \ni loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . \ntake your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . \n'",1

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \njames toback\'s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake\'s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \nfortunately , the film\'s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \nthe film\'s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they\'re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn\'t take long for them to come to the realisation that they\'re being two-timed by the same guy . \nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake\'s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \nit\'s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \nit\'s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film\'s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \nwhether he\'s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it\'s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla\'s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat\'s out of the bag . ) \ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \nhowever , it\'d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou\'s outrage to full feature-length , and it\'s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film\'s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film\'s thematic narrative is rather dubious . \nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \nit\'s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it\'s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake\'s self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance . \nwhile mr . downey jr . \'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america\'s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \nshe\'s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn\'t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it\'s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \n "" i\'m an actor , "" he tells them at one point , using the ol\' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \n "" actors lie .

"" \nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \nhowever , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you\'ve got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy\'s eventful life in the "" big city . "" \nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \nval kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995\'s hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997\'s "" mimic , "" 1998\'s "" the replacement killers "" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy\'s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the "" bad , "" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \nthe one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \nin "" awakenings , "" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film\'s few problems can be swept over to the side . \nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , "" at first sight "" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . \n'",1

"" \nas the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that\'s never fully explained . \nafter months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report . \nmeanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d\'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . \nhis particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . \nhe takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . \nalthough carl\'s been doing this for awhile , he\'s recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast . \nnot fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma . \nfrom the videos in carl\'s house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction . \nto save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl\'s not talking . \nso off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl\'s mind and find out where the cell is in time . \nthe focus of "" the cell "" in on the ornate interior of carl\'s mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality . \nfor the most part , it\'s style without substance . \nin his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father . \nall in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development . \nsingh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem\'s "" losing my religion , "" and "" the cell "" seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted . \nsinger lopez seems to think she\'s in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting . \nthe premise had great promise . \nthe computer-generated world within carl\'s mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic . \nthe first room catharine enters in carl\'s head shows this promise . \nshe finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments . \nthe panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse . \nthis scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder . \nanother element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath . \ntheir minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine\'s own psyche . \nlike sidney lumet\'s "" the offence "" or michael mann\'s "" manhunter , "" "" the cell "" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator . \nhowever , catharine\'s character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role . \nbottom line : don\'t get trapped in this one . \n'",0

"b'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . \nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . \nthe result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn\'t build on to show them as the poets they were . \non paper , this shouldn\'t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . \nbut the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . \ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . \nhe , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . \nbut when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . \nleonardo\'s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud\'s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . \nthe film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . \nhe accepts verlaine\'s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . \nonce there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine\'s busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family\'s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . \nwhen verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they\'re bad poets . "" \nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . \nverlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . \nwhen mathilde\'s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . \nit\'s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . \nin brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . \nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . \nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . \nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . \nthe film ends on a whimper . . . with \nverlaine talking with rimbaud\'s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . \nthis film was especially annoying because rimbaud\'s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . \ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn\'t work . \nit certainly didn\'t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . \n'",0
"b'before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \nthis is a very important note because allen\'s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol\' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \nif you look at the quality of those films , you\'ll hear what i\'m saying . \nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn\'t appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \nthe two do not like each other . \none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \nbut it wasn\'t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron\'s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn\'t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \nhe actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he\'s hypnotized . \nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly "" sick of seeing "" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \nanyway , she\'s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn\'t miss a beat of allen\'s fast-paced dialogue . \ni didn\'t care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \nyum ! \nharumph , but i digress . \nso let\'s recap . \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn\'t expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \ni can\'t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen\'s best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \nit\'s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , "" old-school "" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you\'ve got mail ( 4/10 ) \n'",1
"b'gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world \nthe jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \nwhen the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . \nwith the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world\'s problems . \nthis showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . \nit\'s time to rejoice because we\'ve found our new villain . \nnow it\'s no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it\'s the russian _mafia_ . \na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they\'re not sure even exists . \ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . \nmulqueen\'s ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . \n ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn\'t slip away . \ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller "" the day of the jackal "" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \nas a mystery , "" the jackal "" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there\'s entertainment to be had . \nholes ? let\'s see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . \nthe final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it\'s just the two of them . \nwillis\' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer\'s in "" the saint "" . \n ( and lest you misunderstand , that\'s not a compliment . ) \nbut the three stars are fun to watch . \nit\'s good to see gere in something other than a business suit . \nwillis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . \npoitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . \nthe problems in logic are flaws , but don\'t ruin the experience . \noccasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . \nthis is one of them . \n[the appeared in the 11/20/97 "" bloomington voice "" , bloomington , indiana] \n'",1

"b'capsule : godawful "" comedy "" that\'s amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs . \ni was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . \ni desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . \nget some perspective . \neven dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . \ni tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . \nmichael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . \nthe plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don\'t think i\'m doing a disservice to the movie\'s attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . \nevil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . \npowers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . \nthe basic gag , that of powers\' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . \nthe bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . \nthe movie\'s amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . \none is dr . evil\'s son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it\'s a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . \na lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it\'s desperate rather than clever . \ninstead of skewering the whole thing , it\'s a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . \nmyers himself is also desperate : he\'s given an idea to play , not a character . \nplus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit "" nineties "" ) agent are a waste of time . \ni wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . \nwith a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . \nthe movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . \nthe whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . \nmy definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? \nthe few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . \nthe most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson\'s shorts and sent it sailing . \n'",0

"b'martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . \nhe\'s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . \nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . \ni\'m sure the guy\'s good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" ) . \nof course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind . . . of \ncourse , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . \nso why do i watch his crap ? \ni usually don\'t . \ni will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man\'s movies , unless , and only unless , he\'s in a supporting role ( i . e . \n "" executive decision "" ) and i\'d definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . \n "" executive decision "" ) . \nbut this one has a special place in my heart . \nthis doesn\'t mean it\'s good or that i even liked it . \nthis was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000 . "" \nin this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . \nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . \naround the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or \ndoes he ? \nseagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \none of caine\'s cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \nof course . \nat one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn\'t have any options but blow stuff up . \nhe even goes as far as to say , "" i don\'t want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \ni have no problem with violence . \ni\'m a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \nin the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \nat some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn\'t take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer\'s "" con air . "" \nbut seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \ni wouldn\'t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer\'s mind . \nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can\'t take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \nthen at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn\'t get the message from the trailers . \nwhat seagal doesn\'t realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn\'t comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \nas far as seagal and his acting , he\'s rather boring . \nhe squints , he kills . \nperiod . \nnothing else . \noh , yeah , there\'s corny one-liners ( "" i\'m gonna reach out and touch someone !

"b'vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . \nand , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . \nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . \nand remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . \nthere was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema\'s immensely successful blade , released in august . \nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don\'t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . \n ( for instance , blade\'s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow\'s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) \nblade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . \nboth have their advantages , and here , carpenter\'s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . \nwhen it\'s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . \nthis time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . \nhe\'s a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . \nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a "" master "" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \nvalek kills all of jack\'s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . \napparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . \nso with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . \nthe script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . \ncrow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . \nbaldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith\'s bad guy . \ngriffith\'s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he\'s got to talk sometime . \nluckily , he\'s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . \nall said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . \ncertainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . \n'",1
"b'well , here\'s a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release . \nafter just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? \nit is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was . \nat least some smut would have livened things up a bit . \n "" porky\'s , "" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid . \nwomen , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) . \ntheir plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky\'s , which they are able to get into using fake id\'s . \nafter they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building . \nfor these four teenage guys , this means war on porky\'s . \n "" porky\'s , "" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level . \nas a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough . \nas a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat . \nas a look back at the 1950\'s , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave . \nand as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore . \none of the most offensive things about , "" porky\'s , "" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers . \nthe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool . \nthat sure is revealing information . \nthe female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark . \nthe women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people . \nfor example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of . \nmrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog . \nthere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating . \nto prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80\'s films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison . \nany of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984\'s "" sixteen candles , "" or , 1985\'s "" the breakfast club , "" put , "" porky\'s , "" at an even greater shame . \nthose films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing . \nand heck , if , "" porky\'s , "" wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i\'d take 1982\'s "" fast times at ridgemont high , "" or 1982\'s "" the last american virgin , "" over this any day of the week . \ndirector bob clark is not a bad director . \ntwo years after he made , "" porky\'s , "" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , "" a christmas story .

"b'with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , \nit\'s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . \nwith this and "" crimson tide , "" he\'s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . \nthat film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . \n "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it\'s engrossing for its entire running time , and it\'s scary the way that it shows a man\'s decent into kafkaism , but it\'s too technical . \nit\'s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . \nit casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he\'s charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . \ni hate to do this , but last year\'s film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . \nthe result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . \nnot that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year\'s "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn\'t . \nwill smith\'s character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . \nhe had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . \nhe has a kid , and he\'s raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . \nso he generally doesn\'t have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering "" id4 "" / "" men in black "" territory . \nhe\'s a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of "" six degrees of separation "" for proof of this , not that he isn\'t great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . \nsmith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . \nthe government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . \nas smith\'s plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . \nthese guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they\'re , well , fascinating : they\'re doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn\'t view them as such , and they almost become our friends . \nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn\'t automatically judge them as the villains . \nthey\'re also scary because we get the idea that they\'re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . \nit\'s as if they\'re obsessed with their jobs , not because they\'re evil , but because , hey , it\'s a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . \nunfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that "" the game "" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . \nsure , you\'re chilled , but you\'re not exacty freaked out by what\'s going on . \nbut what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . \nhe\'s a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : "" days of thunder "" ) , but the reason he\'s not great is because he\'s too technical and calculated . \nhis shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they\'re always making sure you\'re paying attention . \nthis is incredibly annoying , and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . \ndespite never actually becoming great , it\'s never actually boring and it\'s always intriguing . \nwatching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith\'s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . \nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you\'ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith\'s plight without a minute\'s worth of boredom . \n'",1
"b'field of dreams almost defies description . \nalthough it\'s about baseball , it\'s not a baseball movie . \nalthough the film is extremely spiritual , it\'s not about religion . \nand although field of dreams is melodramatic , it\'s not a tearjerker . \nto really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . \nin the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , \'60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . \none day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : "" if you build it , he will come .

"b'i have never been so confused after watching a movie . \n "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . \nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . \nat first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . \nthen you\'ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what\'s going on , you\'ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? \nthe script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . \nit feels like an eternity . \nmost of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks . \nthe film is based on alberto caesella\'s play "" death takes a holiday "" . \nthe story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes "" . \nsoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death "" . \nit is bill\'s time . \nbut death has other plans . \nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . \nour bill is chosen to be death\'s guide and in exchange he gets time . \nbill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone\'s attention . \nbill\'s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill\'s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . \nthat is not all , however . \nbill\'s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . \nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . \nit wouldn\'t be fair to say that this film didn\'t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill\'s family for dinner . \nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . \nit is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . \nit\'s one thing to say : "" wouldn\'t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . "" \nto create a motion picture out of this is another . \nfour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . \nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . \non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) . \nhopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . \nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . \nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . \nhow can you play death in human form ? \nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . \nthey are not creatures , but phenomenas . \nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . \nhandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . \nspeaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . \nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . \nclaire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . \nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . \nin other words this is not what i expected from the director of "" scent of a woman "" . \nit could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . \nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera . \n'",0
"b'when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . \nfrom the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they\'re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don\'t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i\'ll be right back , "" etc . ) . \nwhen i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . \nhow hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . \nwas this wes craven\'s remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? \nit just seemed cheap to me . \nthen i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . \nscream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it\'s also a pretty scary movie . \nif you\'ve seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . \nthis is part of the fun of watching scream . \nthe movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . \nto those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . \nthere\'s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . \ni have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . \ntheir opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . \nfrom these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . \nfilms that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . \nthe low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990\'s . \nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson\'s creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . \nscream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . \nwithin the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . \nmainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you\'re dead meat ) . \nnot only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . \nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . \nin this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience\'s satisfaction and amusement . \ni hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . \ni will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream\'s perfect subtlety . \nhowever my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . \nso who knows . \n'",1
"b""well there goes another one . \nsadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . \nthis one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . \nfrom the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . \nwith bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . \nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . \nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . \nhere is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . \njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . \nhe really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . \nso he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . \nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . \nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as \nlong as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . \nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . \nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . \neven the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . \nthe plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . \nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . \neven though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . \nrene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . \nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . \nbrooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . \none really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . \nit's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . \n'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . \ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . \nchris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . \nhe seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . \nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . \nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . \nmaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . \nits based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . \neven though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . \nbesides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . \nit has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . \ni did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . \nthe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . \nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . \nbeing one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . \n""",0

political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n""",1
"b""roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . \nthis italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . \nbut benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . \nthe movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . \nlike many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . \nhe ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . \ninstead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . \nin benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . \nguido wins dora . \nthey marry . \nfast forward about five years . \nguido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . \nguido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . \nbut racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . \nthe task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . \nhere , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . \nit is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . \nfor the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . \ntrue , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . \nunlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . \nhis story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . \nfor guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . \ngiosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . \nthe winner takes home a tank . \ntherefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . \nhe cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . \nguido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . \nguido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . \nthroughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . \nultimately , the allies rescue the camp . \nin a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . \nthe boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . \nthe price for his victory is most high . \nbenigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . \nlife is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . \nit is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . \nthose who object to it are missing its point . \nand that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n""",1
"b'this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff\'s play "" hospitality suite . \'\'its \nabout three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . \nhe is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . \n "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . \nthese three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . \nthe three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . \nthe outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . \nwhat comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . \nthese are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . \ntheir dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . \nfollowing in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . \nin this case , it is landing the big kahuna . \nthey each are trying to see why he\'s on top and why they are chasing after him . \nwhat makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . \nand how after each one\'s psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . \nthe goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . \nlarry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . \nbob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . \nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . \nbob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . \nto just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . \nwhen asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can\'t even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . \nthe contrast in their personalities is stark . \nlarry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . \nhe comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . \nhe criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . \nhe tells him to go on a vacation . \nget a woman . \nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . \nhe now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . \nhe has always been a charmer , shaking everyone\'s hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . \nlarry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . \nin contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . \nthis is his first time for him on the road . \nwhen dick fuller doesn\'t arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . \nwhen told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . \nbut when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man\'s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . \nbob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . \nlarry and phil can\'t fathom how bob didn\'t make a sales pitch . \nbut they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller\'s attention about their company\'s product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . \nthese two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . \nthe irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . \nthese three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . \nthe only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . \nbut the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .

"b'one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , "" you\'d better watch out for the skin deep . "" \ni\'d like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don\'t watch skin deep . \nskin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards . \njohn ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem . \ni never saw edwards\' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . \nyou see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets . \nas the movie opens , zach\'s wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress\' hairdresser . \nlike any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him . \nin response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery . \nif you\'re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley . \nskin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters . \nzach is a rich , \'80s l . a . version of ritter\'s jack tripper character from "" three\'s company . "" \nlike jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he\'s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . \nzach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . \nconsequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . \nin fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife\'s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . \nto add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . \nfor instance , vincent gardenia\'s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . \nof all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach\'s wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role . \nbecause we don\'t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film\'s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . \nthe comedy in skin deep doesn\'t fare much better . \nmost of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . \nabout every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of "" dueling "" condoms . \noverall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . \nmy final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . \nzach\'s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . \nzach\'s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . \nif he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . \nif he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . \nif his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he\'ll clean up his act . \nthe tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter . \nperhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep . \n'",0
"b'because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue\'s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg\'s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated "" mars attacks ! "" \n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage "" mars attacks ! "" \ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \nburton\'s re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \nhe doesn\'t want to lead humanity and he isn\'t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn\'t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \nthe 1968 "" apes "" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \nthe 2001 "" planet of the apes "" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that\'s nothing to complain about . \n'",1

"b'studio expectations must not have been high for "" great expectations "" -- the film\'s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . \nit\'s actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn\'t quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . \n "" great expectations "" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann\'s "" william shakespeare\'s romeo + juliet . "" \n "" great expectations "" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . \nthere\'s icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn\'s ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella\'s auntie who\'s quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . \nfinn , who lives with his sister\'s affable boyfriend ( lone star\'s chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor\'s lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . \nflash forward into the \'90s ( after a brief stop in the \'80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it\'s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . \nthere , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . \nwhen estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \nbut she\'s not the only ghost from finn\'s past that\'s going to be paying him a visit . \ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned "" romeo + juliet "" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \n "" great expectations "" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where "" romeo "" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\'s steamier than the film\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\'s occasional slip-ups . \nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from "" gattaca "" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \npaltrow\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\'t quite understand why she\'s fueling his fire . \nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \nalfonso cuaron\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\'s climax . \nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\'t familiar with the story . \ndespite its script flaws , though , "" great expectations "" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \nand frankly , it\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\'s day , will end up helping "" great expectations "" \' seemingly average box office chances after all . \n'",1

"b'like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved . \nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . \n "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . \nbut "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while . \nit is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . \neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \nand this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \n "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series . \nthat is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \nthe "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \nin "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \nhis character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously . \neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \n "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \ncars flip . \ncars crash . \ncars turn over . \nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \nthere are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \nthose are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \ni hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \nthe villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death . "" \nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \ni liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \n "" metro "" is a no-nonsense movie . \nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \nbut who cares ? \nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \noh , and there were plenty of explosions in "" metro , "" as well . \nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \nif there is one major objection i had to "" metro "" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \n "" metro "" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \npaul haynes "" > \n'",0

"b""anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . . \n ( especially hercules ) . . . \nemotion . \nall the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . \nnot since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . \nthe story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film . \nanastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) . \nbut anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins . \nthe grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution . \na young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money . \nthey pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . \ndimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov . \nthe plot is actually quite well structured . \nthere are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored . \nwhat this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either . \nthere is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses . \nthere is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film . \nhowever , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly . \nthe animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators . \nnot since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them . \neven without the voices , they act . \nthe musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style . \nas with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) . \nthe songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay . . . ) . \ni can't reccomend anastasia highly enough . \nit's a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics . \nkids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it's also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney . \n""",1

"b""all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . \nin fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . \nstill , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . \nno , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . \nspeechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . \nspeechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . \nwhat neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . \nat first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . \nbut there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . \nthe standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . \nscreenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . \nit's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . \npart of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . \nthere is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . \ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . \nthe problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . \ndavis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . \nin a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . \nfor the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . \nyou keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . \nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . \nthe setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . \nhe wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . \nit might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . \ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . \nbut while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . \non screen , it's still paper thin . \n""",0

"b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \nit\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\'s in t2 . \nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \nthere\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\'s every fearful tic . \nit\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \nbut why ? \nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \nthe kind who just won\'t die . \nhollow man\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\'s saddled with the film\'s worst lines ( "" i\'ve lost cohesion again !

"" , she queries , obviously haunted . \nit\'s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . \nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . \nand they\'re the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . \nyou\'ve been warned . \nbut you probably won\'t listen , will you ? \ntis\' a pity ? ? ? \n'",0
"b""seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] \ndo you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? \neveryone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . \nthat seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \nthese types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \ni'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \nthe film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . \nwe meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . \nshe's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . \nmaybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . \nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \nthis agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . \nnearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . \nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \nwhen the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \nconsidering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . \nand so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . \nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . \nsimon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . \nthe third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . \nwe're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . \nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . \ni'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . \nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . \nstill , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : \n ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . \nhe doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . \n ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' \n ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \nit's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' \n ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \n ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . \neven when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . \n ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . \n ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment . \nin fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . \n . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure ! \n ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , ' `clerks , ' `jackie brown , ' `pulp fiction , ' `true romance ; ' also by liman : `swingers'] \n""",1
"b'porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years . \nthey and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country . "" \n "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it\'s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" ) . \nafter years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty\'s next "" ishtar . "" \nso , is it that bad ? \nthe answer is no . \nbut it\'s not very good either . \nthe major problem with "" town and country "" is that it\'s unstructured and random . \nstoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . \nnext scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . \nthen mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples\' divorce lawyer ) . \nellie thinks she\'s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family\'s mississippi manse . \nthe two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they\'d never become a couple to begin with . \nback home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter\'s cheating on her . \nporter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he\'s gay . \nthe four friends , along with every woman porter\'s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . \nalthough the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . \nthe stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who\'s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . \nafter an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . \nporter\'s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . \nonce the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . \nwhile beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . \nmaybe we\'re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn\'t initiate his own sex romps ? \nkeaton\'s ellie has a trusting nature that\'s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . \nhawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives\' club "" while shandling\'s relegated to true second banana status . \nkinski is bland and unmotivated . \nandie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay\'s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . \nheston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . \noscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones . "" \nthe script is this film\'s weakest link - it\'s telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . \nwhile "" town and country "" isn\'t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \n'",0
"b'some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . \nplaying god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it\'s accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . \ncongratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . \nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . \nthen there\'s playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . \nharsh ? maybe . \njustified ? \nhell yes ! \nthis is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . \nfor example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . \nthis does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look ! \njohn woo ! \ntwo guns blazing ! \nslooooow motion !

"b""unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . \nthere's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . \nthe renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . \nbo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . \non top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . \nthen , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . \nright there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . \nbut right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . \ndietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . \nthe film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . \nonce the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . \nwhatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . \naside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . \nbaldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . \npenn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . \nwhat one tough cop lacks is originality . \nthis film offers nothing new . \nnothing that you can't get from any cop film . \nit screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . \nbut even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . \ntoo much else is lacking . \ni also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . \nbut once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . \nat times , i was hoping to see it . \none tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . \nit is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . \nbut one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . \n""",0
"b'i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean\'s war picture . \ni still think that it doesn\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \nand i think that lumet\'s "" 12 angry men "" , wilder\'s "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick\'s "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . \nbut i can\'t deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents . \nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \na bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\'t work as simple workmen . \nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \nand the film doesn\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" . \nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . \nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \nthat means , the picture isn\'t perfect . \nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \nit shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people\'s minds . \nit shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \nand "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \ndavid lean\'s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . \nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \nthe other actors deliver very good performances as well . \njack hildyard\'s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . \ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \n ( c ) karl rackwitz ( klein k ? ris , germany , 1999 ) \n'",1
"b'billed as a "" feminist sex fantasy "" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . \ncamille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film\'s decidedly pro-porn stance . \npolitical considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles\' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . \nin the backdrop , however is bubbles\' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . \nin addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . \nwhen his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . \nthese proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . \ngod herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a "" her "" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . \nthis bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . \nmaking her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary \'straight\' actresses to shame . \nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven\'t used her bountiful talents . \nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of "" boogie nights "" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . \nthe other performances are equally solid . \ndaniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . \nshauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . \noverall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . \nat one point , the title character declares that "" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work "" . \nthe direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . \nroberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70\'s porn and psychedelia . \namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . \nit\'s funny , sexy and subversive . \nand it shouldn\'t be missed . \n'",1

"" \nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let\'s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \ndirector jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby\'s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? "" \nbut enough carping . \n "" rat race "" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \n'",1

"b' "" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ?

"b' "" the end of the affair "" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \nalthough it\'s slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \nbased on graham greene\'s novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \nthere\'s maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile\'s ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he\'s just a normal guy . \nit\'s all work and no play with him . \nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \nunfortunately the two break up . \nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \nit\'s a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \nwhile this may sound straight forward it\'s not . \nit\'s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . \nall this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . \nwith great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . \nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \neven though i didn\'t read the book , there\'s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \nwhat\'s so moving about it you ask ? \nthe tragedy of it all . \nit\'s not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \nback to neil jordan\'s script , it wasn\'t only red roses . \nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \ni\'d have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i\'ve never really found his work to be up to par . \nit just never did anything for me , until now . \nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \nthis is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . \nnot for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . \n'",1
"b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \nit\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \njohn woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \ntheir romance didn\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\'t convincing . \nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \nwhich explains the film\'s mythic theme . . . as \nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \nhopkins then signs off

seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\'s everyone\'s ass . \nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \ncould have lived with it . \nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . \n'",0
"b'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\'t call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\'s story seems much more feasible . \none of the company\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\'s surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\'t always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\'t fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\'s "" mad about you "" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens\' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won\'t experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n'",1
"b'the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . \nhowever , fate is not so easily bested , and alex\'s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . \nessentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . \nunfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . \nas far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . \nthere is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential "" roller coaster "" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . \nunfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . \nthe relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death . \nthe scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . \nif you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . \nother than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable . \n'",0
"b""terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel . \nunfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic . \nthis is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte . \nthe best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order . \nnolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career . \nhad terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film . \ninstead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story . \nthe narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry . \nwith a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film . \nhopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film . \ni give this film . \n""",0
"b""it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \n""",1

"b'kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . \nall he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he\'s thinking . \n "" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas\'s finest performances . \nhe stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . \nthe film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective\'s work in . \nthe film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . \nthe bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . \nhowever , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas\'s wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . \nmany secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . \nsecrets i would not dream of giving away . \nwith a name like "" detective story "" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of "" nypd blue "" , but it doesn\'t quite work out that way . \nhowever , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . \nlee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . \nher scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . \nthe performances all around are fantastic . \ndouglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he\'s not the center of attention all the time . \nwe get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . \nwhich brings me back to douglas . \nhe has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . \nwe can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he\'s really done is gotten back at his criminal father . \nhow he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . \nkirk douglas is the kind of actor we don\'t seem to see to much of these days : he\'s a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . \n'",1
"b'there\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe\'s in "" there\'s something about mary , "" which i * still * haven\'t seen . \nand he\'s in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there\'s "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\'ve proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\'s transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . "" \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \'em to be taken seriously , make \'em do drugs . \n "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl\'s own words , "" the size of utah .

"" \nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it\'s so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl\'s autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \n "" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author\'s words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you\'d swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown\'s own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that\'s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \n'",1
"b'based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst\'s isolated island . \nhowever , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst\'s rumoured plunder . \nwhile the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad\'s characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . \nconrad\'s heyst adheres religiously to his late father\'s ways of detachment and isolation . \nhis ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . \nthe struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe\'s ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . \nwithout properly establishing the crucial details of heyst\'s character , all that is left of conrad\'s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . \non the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe\'s flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . \nin the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . \nthe final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad\'s novel . \nits absence in the film is unforgivable . \nthe film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . \nalma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst\'s underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . \nthe struggle against heyst\'s ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma\'s love for him . \njacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . \nunfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . \nthe couple\'s relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . \nall we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . \nthis is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . \nthe sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe\'s american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . \nthe other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad\'s meticulous characterization . \nwhile schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . \nsam neil\'s caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as "" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror "" . \npoor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . \nsewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones\' back . \nat the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . \ndespite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . \nsourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . \nthe delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . \nat the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma\'s victory was in teaching heyst how to love . \na hollow victory indeed . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",0

"b""the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . \nmore practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . \nalongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . \nin his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . \n ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) \nthis story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . \nthe film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . \nthey hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . \nto reveal any more of the story would be unfair . \nsuffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . \nbava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . \nher character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . \nthe music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . \nand there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . \nyet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . \nlamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . \nscholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . \n""",1
"b'an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d\'arc . \nin history jeanne d\'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . \nshe came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . \na hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . \ndirector/writer luc besson ( \'nikita\' , \'leon\' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . \nbesson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . \nhe tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . \nhe shows her as a human being . \nin a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . \nthe only support and hope is in god . \nat the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . \nthis terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne\'s mind . \ngod is no longer her support . \nhe has become her obsession . \nshe starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . \nwith the help of the wise yolande d\'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . \nafter this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . \nthe movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . \nthe film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne\'s thoughts , imagination and conscience . \nbesson\'s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . \nbut the film is far from being flawless . \nthe script needs a lot of polishing . \nexcept for jeanne , there are no real characters . \nand although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . \nas for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . \nin the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . \njovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . \nbut though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( \'being john malcovich\' ) and dunaway ( \'titus\' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . \nand even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . \nbesides casting jovovich , besson\'s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . \nthere are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . \nand some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the "" three musketeers "" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . \nthough all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . \nand thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . \n\'the messenger\' has muscles instead of brains . \nthere is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . \ndustin hoffman\'s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . \njeanne\'s character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . \nwas she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? \nor was she truly a messenger of god ? \nthe film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . \nbess o messenger\' is nothing more than a fairly good film . \nit is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . \nmaybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . \nit is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it\'s on the battlefield . \n'",1
"b""i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . \ni've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . \nbreakdown , then , is something of a surprise . \nrussell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . \nto say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . \nrussell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . \nwhile journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . \nwalsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . \nbecause of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . \nthat , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . \nbreakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . \nas with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . \njeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . \nwhen we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . \nrussell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . \nj . t . \nwalsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . \nthe reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . \nbreakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . \none of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time . \n""",1

"" \nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world . \nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \ni\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \nsurprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \nthe makers of "" rush hour 2 "" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "" rush hour . "" \nfirst and foremost to me , in "" rh2 , "" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\'s artistry in fight choreography . \nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \nchan\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \nthe combo of chan\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the "" lethal weapon "" films . \nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \nlone doesn\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to "" get lee and carter , "" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \nzhang zi-yi ( "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn\'t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \ndirector ratner and the original "" rush hour "" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives "" rh2 "" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \ni\'m surprised to even say that "" rush hour 2 "" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \ni give it a b . \n'",1
"b""in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . \nhe rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . \nburton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . \nwriter andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . \nas `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' . \nlandau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . \nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . \nlandlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . \ncrane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . \nfirst and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film . \nas with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . \nthe horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . \nbut why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? \nalthough enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . \nit was the light comic touch that burton applied . \nthe film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . \nthis is certainly not the only alteration that's been made . \nas the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . \nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . \nit's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . \nstill , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention . \nthe costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . \nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . \na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . \nwalken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . \ni suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . \nall of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . \n`sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . \nif you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time . \n""",1
"b'labelling is sometimes everything . \nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \nproducers weren\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \nthat is far away from warriors\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \nif walter hill\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \nthe future was much worse than his vision . \nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \nin their vocabulary , word "" arms "" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \n'",1

"b' "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\' music . \nhe\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\'s "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\'s right and going against the entire town . \n "" it\'s your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\'s performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n'",1

"b'as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . \nyou know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies . \noscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . \nas gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . \noddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . \nat times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . \ni probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . \nsome of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . \nlike emmerich\'s id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . \nsure it\'s predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . \nand isn\'t that the point of the patriot ? \ngibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . \nhe is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . \nas the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . \nbut when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . \nforming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . \nthe best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . \nevery time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis\' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . \nand as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . \nas for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . \nclearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . \nyou really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . \neverything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . \nit\'s organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . \nthere is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin\'s take-no-prisoners method . \nwhat drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . \nplayed wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . \nthis character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . \nhis portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic . "" \ni disagree with this accusation . \ntavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . \nbesides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . \nand stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? \nheck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? \nthe patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . \nwith an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it\'s a lethal weapon for the colonial times . \ngod bless america ! \nand god bless the patriot ! \n'",1
"b'when i left the theater after seeing david lynch\'s "" lost highway , "" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , "" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . "" \nin his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture "" eraserhead "" on the weirdness scale . \nyou won\'t "" know "" what happened when it\'s over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . \nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . \ni can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . \nthey are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn\'t help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons\' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . \nthe next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . \nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . \nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee\'s spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . \ni would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn\'t offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end . \nthis description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch\'s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch\'s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred\'s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch\'s typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway "" it works perfectly . \nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred\'s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil\'s "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \nlynch\'s direction and director of photography pete deming\'s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer\'s attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \nthe main characters in this "" reality "" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn\'t find in any of the two dozen "" pulp fiction "" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film\'s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \nlynch\'s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \nit\'s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \nthat said , these minor flaws don\'t prevent "" lost highway "" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \n'",1
"b""the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \ndid dolores kill her husband ? \nand did she kill her employer ? \ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \n""",1

"" \nwhat\'s eating gilbert grape ? \nis such a film . \nit\'s a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \nas the man of the house since his father\'s suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges\' screenplay , based on his own novel . \nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town\'s mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen\'s desperately unhappy housewife . \none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \nit\'s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert\'s description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . "" \ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie\'s repeated chants of , "" we\'re not going anywhere , "" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father\'s footsteps in this regard . \njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \ndepp\'s performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio\'s astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert\'s tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert\'s sisters . \nonly juliette lewis doesn\'t quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \n'",1
"b'maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it\'s not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . \nbecause it\'s not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it\'s so great . \nunderneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . \nit doesn\'t merely go from plot point to plot point . \nit goes from character to character . \nit obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . \nit\'s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real . \nin short , this movie is just awesome . \nit merely tells its story really well , and that\'s something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they\'re not told by great storytellers . \ndirector anand tucker tells this story well . \nhe overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . \nthe film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . \nthey are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . \njackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . \nwhen they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . \nthey marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she\'s alone . \nshe enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary\'s country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . \nit\'s all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn\'t been handled in such a way . \nthe key thing here is that it\'s not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it\'s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . \ntheir relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they\'re also completely jealous of one another . \nwhen a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can\'t , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . \nwhen jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i\'ve ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . \nand the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . \nanother thing i really liked is emily watson\'s performance . \ni usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . \nmy reasoning for this is that it\'s a fucking easy job . \nthe worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she\'s good , but what\'s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old\'s body ? \nhell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . \nin that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother\'s lover is scared off . \nshe has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . \nbut the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . \nif you don\'t believe me , look at jack nicholson\'s performance in "" as good as it gets "" : great performance , but easy job . \nthis isn\'t so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . \nand thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we\'ve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . \nrachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson\'s protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . \ngriffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from "" breaking the waves "" and "" the boxer "" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who\'ve already deemed watson\'s performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she\'s the one who doesn\'t get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . \nafter all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in "" rainman "" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . \nshe does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it\'s griffiths . \ntogether , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven\'t been seen this year . \nif it hadn\'t been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i\'d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . \nit\'s so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it\'s nearly a shame that it\'s not the flawless gem that it should be . \nbut , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . \n'",1
"b""i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . \nbut darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . \nit's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation . \nin addition , it's also a terrific family film . \nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . \nit could also be described as `mrs . \nstreep's opus' . \nyes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . \nout of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view . \nshe is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? \nslowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . \none thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven . \nafter leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . \nat first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . \nit doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . \nholland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . \nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . \nyes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work . \nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience . \nblue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . \ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . \nit's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner . \nthe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin . \nthere's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . \nin it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . \nit's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . \nit's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . \nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? \nof course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? \nmission accomplished , wes . \nthankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . \nin it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . \nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . \nthe mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . . \nbasically everything is there . \nit doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing . \nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . \n""",1
"b'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\' indians that doesn\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- "" south park "" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute\' indian tribe that packer\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\' or revealing what\'s underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker\'s songs are very catchy . \nyou\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\'s a shpadoinkle day\' out of your head once you\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every "" south park "" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\'s song\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\'s songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that\'s a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\'ve ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n'",1
"b'some movies\' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they\'re finally released , everyone just goes along with it . \nthus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations . \nlast year it was the thin red line . \nthis year\'s "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool . \nacclaimed director norman jewison\'s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun . \nand that\'s supposed to be ok because , see , it\'s a true story . \nit\'s about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) \ndetective ( dan hedaya ) who\'s had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) \nwhen rubin was only ten . \nhe is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole . \nmost of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison . \nto the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives . \nlesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education . \nlesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin\'s autobiography . \nimmediately thereafter , schreiber\'s character tells lesra "" sometimes we don\'t pick the books we read , they pick us . "" \nhmmm . \nafter a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin\'s innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him . \nthey meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane\'s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings . \nof course , we\'re already told that he\'s innocent . \na movie like this is especially frustrating because we\'re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life . \nall too obviously , we\'re getting the hollywood watered- down version . \nthat would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it . \nit\'s almost cruel . \nthe melodrama isn\'t of the entertaining kind either ; it\'s the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity . \nwitness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists . \nthe hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it\'s a no-frills courtroom movie . \nit\'s formula stripped to the bare necessities . \nyou have your wrongly accused black man . \nyou have your melodramatic final courtroom scene . \nbut there\'s nothing else . \nyou\'d expect some sort of involving investigation . \nbut that\'s not necessary since we\'re implicitly informed of his innocence . \nthus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding . \nbrooding to himself . \nbrooding to other inmates . \nbrooding to lesra . \nbrooding to lesra\'s canadian friends . \nbrooding in letters . \ni don\'t think i\'ll ever look at brooding the same way again . \nit wasn\'t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane\'s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition . \ni wanted something to happen . \nas for washington\'s performance in the title role -- i figured i\'d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it\'s received -- he is top notch , though still boring . \nhow is that possible ? \nwell , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly . \nunfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap . \nwhat a waste of a great performer . \nspeaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ? \nhe\'s an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ? \nto call his character ( along with schreiber\'s and unger\'s ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement . \nall three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come . \nif they\'re to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ? \nlook : if you\'re going to make a formula movie , don\'t undermine the formula . \ncourtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous . \nnot only is it trite , it\'s boring . \n'",0

"b' "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist\'s psyche rather than the artist\'s lifeline . \nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film\'s subject , looked at it personally . \nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what\'s going on . \nexactly what was i looking at ? \nwatching this film , i wasn\'t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon\'s world and psyche . \nas such , there is no real story . \ni\'ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn\'t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he\'s like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \nit\'s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \n "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life . \nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \nwhile creating bacon\'s world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \nwhile watching this , that\'s basically all i thought was there . \nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \nonce the film is over , it\'s easier to piece it together . \ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \nsomeone doesn\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\'s "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\'t for george . \ni guess that explains the title . \na bit . \nthat\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \ni wish it hadn\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\'s twisted pysche . \nit\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\'s throat . \nthat way you don\'t reduce your film to something it\'s just not . \ni can\'t say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though . \ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \nit\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city , "" it\'s the year\'s most visually stunning film . \nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \n'",1
"b'seen at the 21st portland international film festival \nfilm title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . . \nfunny and pointed in its own way . \nif you don\'t care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . . \nmaybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . \nhaving , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets\' own war , to get the consumers . \nand while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . \ngoro has a supermarket . \nand a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . \nbargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro\'s humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . \ngoro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . \nhanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . \nand the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves . \nhanako\'s ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all . \nand hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . \nif not cause some serious problems in the running of the store . \na price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . \nas the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . \neventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . \nand here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . \nin the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . \nwith some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested . \nbut this would take away from the satire and its strengths . \nwith food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . \nand what fun it is . \nworth seeing . \n ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . \nwe would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . \nnot to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . \namerica is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . \nwe could learn something along the way , too . . . . \nworth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . \nthe funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . \ntampopo is also very enjoyable . \nall four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . \nask for it . \n'",1
"b'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \nin "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \nin "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \neven in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \nin his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \nbooker\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\'t work . \ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\'s hard not to see annie and grace\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \nin "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor . \nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago . \nin many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \nmuch of the film\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \nin terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\'s "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\'s "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) . \nalthough "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \nin "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \nit\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \nthe best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \nalthough booker\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make "" the horse whisperer "" worth the price of admission . \n'",1
"b'wolfgang petersen\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\'t really much of a story to tell . \nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of "" the storm of the century . "" \nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \nnot nearly enough . \nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \ni have yet to read sebastian junger\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \nit is not the all-star cast\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \nallen payne\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\'s never given any lines ! \nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \nfichtner\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\'t know what he\'s doing there , where he\'s from , or who he\'s supposed to be . \nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene "" you know what would look good on you ? \nme ! "" \nooooh real creative ) . \nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \ni guess i\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \n'",0
"b'ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . \nsynopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? \nin dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . \ndark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . \npoor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . \na mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . \nis john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? \nhe searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . \nbut when the clues don\'t fit , it doesn\'t just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . \nto john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . \nhow come it\'s always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? \nand how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? \nevery night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the \'strangers\' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people\'s heads with big hypodermic needles . \nthe strangers have the ability to \'tune , \' or warp reality using telepathic powers . \nturns out , the city is not on earth at all . \nand the reason why john doesn\'t fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . \neven with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? \nopinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always "" used to have big spaceships blow up cities . \ni think we\'re a little tired of that . "" \naccording to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . \nit\'s designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . \nit\'s a philosophical piece . \ncinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . \nbut science fiction in books reaches beyond the \'shoot-em-up\' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? \nwhat is the human condition ? \nwhat is ethical ? \nwhat would a true human being do ? \nfar from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . \ndark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . \na little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . \nthe people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . \nmeanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . \nwhen science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . \nbut the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . \nthis is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . \nthe existentialists\' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . \nin dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens\' scientific experiments on the human beings\' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , "" because the human condition isn\'t located in here .

"" \nthe film\'s plot doesn\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \nfeldman\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \nthey simply could have called it "" action movie . "" \nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon . \naction movies don\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \nthe film\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \nit\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure . \ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \nseeing russell in drag is the movie\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \nmachine guns and torture generally don\'t mix well with comedy . \njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \nteri hatcher plays stallone\'s sister and russell\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \nbut regrettably , hatcher\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \nthere\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\'t bother . \n'",0

"" \npatrice lumumba\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\'s and 60\'s . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\'s life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n "" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n'",1

"b' "" it was not scary . "" \nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over . \nwhen a movie is called _vampires_ , "" not scary "" aren\'t words that should be associated with it . \nbut that wasn\'t my only gripe . \njohn carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . \nunfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . \nwith an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter\'s vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . \nthe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . \nlike some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . \ntheir method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . \nto commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . \ntheir celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . \nwoods\' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . \nalthough the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . \nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys\' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who\'s on a mission that dates back 600 years . \nalong the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . \nupham in _saving private ryan_ . \nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can\'t remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . \n_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . \nonly then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . \nbut it\'s too little too late . \nwe get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we\'re dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) \ninterestingly , last summer\'s vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . \nwoods\' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . \nand his motive for killing vampires ? \ntake a wild guess . \n ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) \nat least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . \n_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . \nto make up for this , the movie resorts to other "" shocks , "" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to "" getting woodies .

"b'cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . \nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . \nthe story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i\'ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . \nthe film is based on a "" mostly "" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . \nit\'s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . \nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . \nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . \ntim robbin\'s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . \nfor robbin\'s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . \ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . \nlet me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it\'s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . \ni\'ll begin with those involved with the play . \nthere\'s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . \noutside the play there\'s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who\'s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \nthere\'s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . \nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . \nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . \nthe whole film is like this , and it\'s basically nothing but a headache . \non the brighter side , tim robbin\'s direction was masterful . \nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson\'s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can\'t make a movie that much better . \nalthough it has it\'s moments ( not many of them , but they\'re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it\'s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . \n'",0
"b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look ! \nart ! "" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we\'re constantly made aware that we\'re watching a play or a movie , it\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\'s ideas . \nthey\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\'t bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\'s different , ( b ) it\'s not like anything they\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\'s pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n'",0

"b""there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . \nrecommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . \na comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs . \nwhat follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . \nfirstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . \nto be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . \nmimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . \n ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) \nit is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . \nhowever , the film simply fails on that note . \nthe effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . \nshe's still making good money though . \nt ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . \nbut the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . \nrobert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . \nleoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . \nwarning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . \nplot holes , plot holes , plot holes . \nnow , e . l . e . \nis threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? \nwhere's the logic ? \nleder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . \nand then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . \nthe film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . \ni also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . \nit's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . \nbuilding caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . \nstrangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . \nnow that is a more practical use for caves . \nwhat is the point of living in caves ? \nthere is no , unlike `dr . \nstrangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . \nhow do plants grow ? \nif humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . \nthe president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . \nobviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . \nin an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . \nthis is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact . \nbut even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it . \nokay ? \n""",0

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\'t ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\'s a catch -- he\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\'s now infected with alien dna . \npatrick\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\'s primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here . "" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful . "" \nand she\'s not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he\'s going to rape her . "" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( "" he\'s in aisle 1 ! "" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\'s brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\'s being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that "" she\'s so empowered . "" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\'s * what i call empowerment . \n'",0
"b'wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . \nover black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . \nthe "" original "" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . \none day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite , but because that\'s exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . \nthe twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . \nwe are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . \nas unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . \nthere\'s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . \ni soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . \nonce the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . \nrather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . \nnot just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing \nfor years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . \nhowever , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . \nyup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . \nokay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . \nprojected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . \nbefore you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . \nthis is just as well . \nthe characters are so bad that the viewer doesn\'t care about any of them . \nthey\'re either silly , sappy , or both . \nthe dialog gets much of the credit for this . \nan example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle .

"b'the tagline on random hearts reads "" in a perfect world , they never would have met . "" \nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \nkay\'s distraction from the film\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \nrandom hearts\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \n'",0
"b'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \nconsidering that the skeptic\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \nterry gilliam\'s "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don\'t much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \nis "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ? \nyes . \ndoes it matter ? \nnot really . \nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \'69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\'t really the point . \nwhen "" frequency "" gets cooking , it\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\'s face it : it\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\'t believe in the characters , we don\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show "" homicide : life on the street , "" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn\'t like about "" frequency "" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that "" frequency "" may best work as a "" guy "" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of "" field of dreams "" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ?

"b' "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . "" \nstarring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong \neight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . \nneither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . \nand along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . \nslim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . \nwhen the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . \nhe does not seem particularly out of place . \nin fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . \nhe brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they\'re american ) --the tokens of his success . \nhe also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . \nhe loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents\' village . \nwhen he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . \nall of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening\'s end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . \nbut eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . \ndirector mabel cheung ( an autumn\'s tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . \nslim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . \nseeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . \nthe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . \non his way to his parent\'s village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . \nslim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . \nthat\'s predictable . \nthe manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . \nthe emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . \nit\'s typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . \nbut here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . \nthe fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . \neight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . \nwhen odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , "" it\'s all the same . \nwherever we go , we\'ll be in chinatown , "" and her straightforward statement expresses much . \nthere is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . \nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . \nbut they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . \nsuch is life . \nthe movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . \neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . \nslim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . \nthe exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people\'s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . \nyes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . \n'",1
"b'contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . \nit\'s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . \nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . \nwe\'ve seen it all before , and we\'re just not blown away with it like we should be . \noh well . \nit\'s still an excellent irish story . \n "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . \nfirst off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . \nwhile this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle\'s "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . \ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . \nand danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" \'s emily watson ) , who hasn\'t seen him since he went in . \nthey don\'t easily start up their romance again because she\'s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny\'s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . \nbut the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . \nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself . \nwe\'ve seen it many a time before , but it\'s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . \nthere\'s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . \nthe boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . \nthere are only a few boxing scenes , but they\'re never like "" raging bull "" /let\'s-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . \nthey\'re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . \nand i didn\'t know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . \nbut the backbone of the story is the love one . \nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . \ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . \nit made sure that we didn\'t just care for one of them . \ni\'m not saying they\'re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . \nthe acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . \ni\'m not sure if they\'re oscar-nominee bound , but they\'re very good . \nin the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . \nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . \nthe direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . \ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . \nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . \nthough "" the boxer "" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . \nsure , it\'s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it\'s own , it just could have been better . \nbut it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . \neven if it could have been better , this\'ll do . \n'",1

"" \nhowever , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes . \nhollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s . \nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus\' discovery of america . \none of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers . \nthe hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . \nwhen the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation . \nhowever , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless . \nwith not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign . \ngeneral crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn\'t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest . \ninstead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . \ntogether with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo . \ngeronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . \nso , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies . \nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . \nalthough such elements of john millius\' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . \nto be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . \ninstead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . \nto make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . \nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo\'s life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . \nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \neven hill\'s directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . \neven his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . \non the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic . \nall in all , compared with some of the hollywood\'s examples of political correctness , this film isn\'t so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . \n'",0
"b'even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . \ndown periscope stars kelsey "" frasier "" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer\'s ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . \nlike any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn\'t belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . \nthen comes the transparent plotline . \nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . \nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can\'t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . \nfinally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . \nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . \nfirst they\'re singing "" louie louie "" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they\'re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . \nthe whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . \nit\'s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . \nthe jokes are right out of "" mchale\'s navy "" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . \nthere\'s one scene where schneider looks through the ship\'s pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , "" this expired in 1966 ! "" \ni yelled back at the screen , "" so did these jokes . "" \ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . \nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . \nthe blame can\'t really be placed on the stars , though . \nkelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn\'t have anything to work with . \nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had "" welcome aboard "" tatooed on his penis . \ngrammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . \nsame for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she\'s so gorgeous . \nas for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he\'s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the "" snl "" ship . \nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( "" okay , it\'s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber .

"b'ok , let\'s get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it\'s not too bad , really . \nit\'s the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo\'s maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . \nin lam\'s film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn\'t be noticed ) . \nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don\'t have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \nin little odessa , he meets mikhail\'s girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \nafter all , one thing that\'s been missing from woo\'s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \nmovies like this shouldn\'t be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don\'t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don\'t make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv\'s "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \nyou\'ll see . \nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he\'s getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \nbut what has he become ? \na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \ndoesn\'t sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \nbut let\'s face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there\'s not much left . \nalthough it\'s short on spectacle , lam\'s film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \ni\'m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that\'s a good sign . \ngo see maximum risk , but don\'t expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don\'t hold this against him . \n'",1

"b'synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . \nwhile this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . \ncomments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . \ni\'m not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . \nsuspense ? \nfamily drama ? \nhumor ? \nerotica ? \nelements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . \ninstead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . \ni suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren\'t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . \nalicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . \nher character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters\' fantasies . \neveryone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . \nthe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . \nthe father ( played by j . t . \nwalsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband\'s best friend . \nnone of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . \nthe thug , in the meantime , proves that he\'s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . \nthe most absurd character , however , is the babysitter\'s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . \nthe thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn\'t really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . \nincredible ! \n ( of course , the boyfriend\'s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . \nthere are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . \nby that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . \nno suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . \ni found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . \nthe characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . \nfinally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . \nthe dream sequences aren\'t erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . \ni can\'t completely trash this movie . \nthe first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . \nthe other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . \nsilverstone\'s character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks "" what were you thinking ?

"b'in my review of there\'s something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn\'t everything .

"b""waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . ' \nin the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . \ndoes being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? \nthrough the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . \nexpressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . \nin the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . \ndeputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . \nwe see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . \nwhat is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . \nwhat once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . \nto the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos . \nlang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . \nthe shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . \nas the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . \nthe stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . \nbecause the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . \nas the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . \nthis shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . \nwhile a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . \nwe see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . \nwith the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . \nin this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . \nin some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . \nlang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . \nas joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . \nlang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . \nusing his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty . \nreprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity . \n""",1

"" \ni was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . \nthis is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal\'s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . \nseagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . \nhowever , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . \nstill , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . \n'",0
"b'three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don\'t stand in the way of your wife\'s actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it\'s muddy in there . \n "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . \nwildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . \nafter savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . \nfrom the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there\'s a lot to think about here . \njust don\'t forget to have fun . \nclearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . \n "" i wrote \'being john malkovich\' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . \nit\'s important to me that i don\'t have a map before i start . \nthis allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface .

"b'i don\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\'t act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\'ll play every character in the movie . \ni just can\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n'",0
"b""the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains . \nwe see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape . \nthey kiss , then walk on . \none of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls . \nthe glass on his mask cracks . \nhis face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . . \nthen doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up . \nit's all been a dream . \nhe wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . . \ntotal recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot . \nquaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised . \none day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself . \nquaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan . \nthe implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing . \nhowever , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him . \nquaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' . \nhe get's his ass to mars . \nmars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air . \nagainst him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants . \nthe rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air . \neventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him . \nthroughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie . \nnaturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding . \nas you can tell , it's violent stuff . \nbut it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable . \nthe acting is variable . \narnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . \nstone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . \nbut , she does sex scenes alright . \nticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . \none minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . \nso , the good guys are awful . \nbut , the bad guy's are excellent . \ncox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end . \nironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . \nthe supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . \none disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . \nilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . \nsome of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . \nanother irritating thing is the product placement . \nthere are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . \nthere's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) \noverall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . \nfor a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all . \nin fact , it's very good . \n""",1
"b""keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \nthey need not have wasted their time . \nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \nheadache , as i said . \nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \n""",0
"b'originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e . \n "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman . \nplot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love . \ncritique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties . \nhow do people fall in love ? \nwhy do people fall out of love ? \nhow do people fall back into love , once they\'ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? \nall of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships . \nmeet a hip , young couple going through their first date . \na divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships . \na married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband . \na husband letting go of his inhibitions . \nan older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered . \na son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital . \nthere are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity . \ndiversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels . \nsome related to the younger couples\' issues . \nothers with the married . \nthere\'s a little bit of everything for everyone in here . \nand i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament . \njust like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels . \nthe actors in this film are all also very , very good . \nsean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations . \njolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever . \nanderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart . \neven dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination . \nthe only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn . \nthe actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else . \nthe ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that\'s just hollywood . \nthis film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness . \nthe characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today\'s relationships . \nall in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much . \non top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same . \nthis is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of "" adult films "" . \nbefore this , he had written and produced many children\'s movies . \ngillian anderson stands 5\'2 . \nangelina jolie\'s full name is angelina jolie voight . \nshe is actor jon voight\'s daughter . \nshe has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute . \nshe divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting ( 8 . 5/10 ) \nfame in 1997 . \nthey were married in 1995 . \nactor ryan phillippe\'s full name is matthew ryan phillippe . \nhe stands 5\'9 , and spent his childhood in new castle , delaware . \nhis acting career started on tv\'s "" one life to live "" . \nhe portrayed daytime television\'s first gay teenager . \njon stewart\'s full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz . \nthis film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture . \nwatch for movie posters from swingers ( 8 . 5/10 ) , \nchasing amy ( 7/10 ) and the texas chainsaw massacre ( 8/10 ) at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date . \n'",1
"b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \nthere\'s a guy\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \nit\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \nbut if you think you\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \nwhether it\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \nthe best thing is how these words aren\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\'re said in character , like tea leoni\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\'s able to say under assault , "" it\'s understandable if you find this threatening "" . \nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \nlike allen , russell\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \nstill , if you\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la "" murphy brown "" / "" frasier "" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\'t happen . \nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \n'",1
"b""`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . \nwading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic . \nthose hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . \nawaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money . \nalthough he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor . \nmost will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile . \ncan o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? \nperhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . . \nbut `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements . \nthe actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success . \na few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' . \no'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) . \njimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage . \nthe problem is that his proposal sucks . \nbig time . \nyou can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach . \nand then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens . \njimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) . \neverybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie . \nof course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years . \nthe bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day . \nwith anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . . \nand within a very limited time frame . \nthere are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' . \nfor one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? . \nanother is the colorful cast . \no'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity . \nustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures . \nand now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . \nthe characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable . \nyes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute . \nthe screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived . \nthe considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained . \npotential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes . \n`the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . \nyou've seen the tv spots , haven't you ? \no'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? ' \nin actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . \nafter seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . \no'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge . \n""",0
"b""the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . \nplaced in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . \njust what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . \nas with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . \na car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . \nalong the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . \nin brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . \nthere is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . \nremarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . \neven more remarkably , it works . \nthe only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . \nwith every good film the audience gains new knowledge . \nhere you learn _two_ things . \neveryone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . \nand don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers . \noh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy . \n""",1
"b'one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o\'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton\'s 1925 silent film seven chances . \nnow i\'ve never seen seven chances , as i\'m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . \no\'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . \nhe also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he\'s unwilling to marry her . \nhis reasons ? \nwell he\'s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don\'t like to be roped or something ( hey , that\'s the movie\'s explanation . . . \ni\'d marry renee zellweger in a second ) . \neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it\'s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . \nhe essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring . \nthe audience should now hate this character . \ni did . \nthen the meat of the plot presents itself . \njimmie\'s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . \nhowever , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . \nhaving blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" . \nthe movie wasn\'t half bad by this time , surprisingly . \nit wasn\'t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . \nustinov\'s character left a video will , and while he\'s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster\'s millions ? "" . \nas soon as i thought it , hal holbrook\'s character actually says "" what is this , brewster\'s millions ? "" \nit was quite surreal . \nsomething happens though during the film\'s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . \nup to that point , all of jimmie\'s prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good . \nat least the film wasn\'t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . \nwhen jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . \nat this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . \nthese women arrive at jimmie\'s location and immediately start bullying him about what he\'s looking for in a woman . \nwhen he\'s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there\'s been a mistake and he won\'t be marrying any of them . \nas a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . \nthis goes on for the rest of the film . \nit\'s just chris o\'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . \nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles . \nthe film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i\'m still groaning . \nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . \nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . \napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o\'donnell around the city , and at one point o\'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . \nso that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? \nugh . \n'",0
"b'the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . \nbut after diasappointing films such as "" godzilla "" and "" fear and loathing in las vegas "" , it would be nice to see a really good film . \nbut i doubt you could have expected this . \nthe truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the "" decade\'s best "" list . \nthere is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , "" yes , that\'s what makes this film great . "" \nthe blend of peter weir\'s masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou\'s stunning photography and jim carrey\'s performance is what makes this film work so fantastically . \nthere is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . \nit may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . \ncarrey has made a very wise choice . \nby playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side . \nthat is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes . \ntruman burbank was born to an audience of millions . \nhe was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show . \neverything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show\'s director , christof ( played by ed harris ) . \neveryone in truman\'s life is an actor or an extra . \nthey are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman\'s life . \nbut he is the only person that is not aware of it . \nthe classification of the truman show may be tricky . \nthe audience reacted to many of truman\'s revelations with laughter . \ni did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character . \nthe things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong . \nso is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ? \na drama ? \nit really depends on the audience . \nbut to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others . \nbut above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism . \noscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less . \n'",1

america\'s video shelves . \nhaving made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . \nhis latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . \nand by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true . \njackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . \nthe royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . \nunwilling to

chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . \nchon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . \non a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o\'bannon ( owen wilson ) . \nhe is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . \nwith his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang\'s uncle . \nchon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . \nas the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who

, a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . \n "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun . \nthe chemistry between the cast is remarkable . \nthe performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . \njackie\'s performance is as good as anything he\'s done before . \nhe\'s not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . \nbut jackie\'s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . \nowen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o\'bannon . \nhis innocence is refreshing and fun . \na bad guy that\'s not really bad . \nhis scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . \nlucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . \nthe character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . \nthe rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . \nnothing here is realistic , mind you . \n "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . \nand the performances match that style with ease . \nthe cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . \nusing calgary , alberta as the prime location . \nmr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . \nnothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . \nand as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . \nhomage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . \nit is a comforting experience . \nat a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . \nhere is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . \nthis is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o\'brian or john wayne . \ndirector tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood\'s past . \nin this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . \nnothing here really stands out , or takes one\'s attention away from the story or action . \nand that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . \nand what of the action and stunts . \nwell , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie\'s hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . \nhis timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . \njackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . \nfinally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . \nto sum up , "" shanghai noon "" is a fun summer confection . \nnot too heavy and not too light . \na fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . \nan enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . \nwhen doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . \ncomments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . \nmalicious , however , really doesn\'t provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . \nthe plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . \nit starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . \nmelissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . \nshe drugs someone . \nshe kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend\'s apartment . \nand , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she\'s spying on doug and his girlfriend . \ni won\'t reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it\'s both painfully obvious and a real yawner . \njohn vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script\'s faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . \nthe same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . \nat times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i\'m-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . \nat other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . \nin one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches "" f--k you , you b-----d "" and throws a phone . \nshe delivers the line so ridiculously that one can\'t help but laugh . \nmalicious certainly isn\'t the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn\'t all that good or original either . \nfeel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . \n'",0
"b""those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \ni haven't even seen that . \ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \n""",1

"" \nabout ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . \nwe\'ve always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . \nto date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . \nmost of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . \n ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) \nnow we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . \n ( well , she\'s not a widow , and the kid isn\'t her daughter , but you get the idea . ) \nthe lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn\'t given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . \nthe child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . \nin simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . \nthe polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . \nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . \nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . \nenola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . \nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . \nthe psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . \nplayed with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that\'s close to amusing . \nhis performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn\'t enough there to be funny . \nthe star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . \nhe\'s playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . \nvery little is done with this . \nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth\'s surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . \n ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it\'s more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) \ni\'m quite fond of tina majorino\'s previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn\'s past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner\'s dances with wolves . \nbut this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! \nthis movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there\'s * nothing * in it we haven\'t seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . \nat 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . \nthe budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . \nin sum , this movie is beneath contempt . \nit has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . \nif you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . \notherwise you\'ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks . \n'",0
"b' "" desperate measures "" is a generic title for a film that\'s beyond generic . \nit\'s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "" before and after "" than "" reversal of fortune . "" \nthe movie is a big disappointment , and yet it\'s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . \ntoo bad the execution\'s all wrong , though , because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . \nsan francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . \neven worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . \nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he\'s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . \nwhen he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . \none misstep "" desperate measures "" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt\'s illness . \nwhat\'s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . \ntake , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . \nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? \nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . \nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . \nwhatever . \nto be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie\'s problems . \nfirst and foremost is how cheaply "" desperate measures "" trades the potential of it\'s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . \nonce mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . \nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . \nalso , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia\'s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; "" desperate measures "" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie\'s head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . \nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . \ncast against type , michael keaton\'s understated menace is highly effective . \nalthough he\'s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . \njoseph cross , as garicia\'s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . \nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . \nit goes without saying that "" desperate measures "" needs an operation of its very own . \n'",0
"b'my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air . \nsure , i\'d seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . \neven though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50\'s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet . "" \nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webb\'s rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . \nas what would happen if sgt . \njoe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . \nin this election year , i\'m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . \nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb\'s office door and enters . \nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . \nthe "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying . \nthis is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . \ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . \ngives us more -- much more . \nwebb\'s mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . \nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself .

"" \ni couldn\'t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . \n ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day\'s work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . \nhe meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . \nwebb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" \nbogart he ain\'t . \nthe other d . i . \ngets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he\'s a damn good d . i . \n . . . \ni guess i\'m just a little jealous . "" \njoin the club , we\'re all jealous of jack webb\'s way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman\'s place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . \n "" you expect me to talk to you . . . \nin _here_ ? ! "" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . \nthe woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . \na little girl spots him in the store and demands , "" what are you doing in here . . . you\'re a man , aren\'t you ? "" \nhe doesn\'t reply , but you know he\'s thinking in his head , "" what an odd species of human -- so small . \nmust be one of those children everyone\'s been talking about . "" \nthis poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he\'s responsible for . \nthe movie doesn\'t focus too closely on webb\'s romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . \nafter two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , "" was that flea you killed a male or female ? "" \nowens replies , "" a male , sir . "" \nwebb yells to the platoon , "" this ain\'t the one ! "" \nthat such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . \nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . \nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . \nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldn\'t do a more comical job than webb did . \nit makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . \nthere\'s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . \nwebb bursts in the room and shouts , "" what did i tell you about laughing ? !

"b""can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ? \ni think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe . \nthe sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date . \nunlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary . \nthe film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday . \nwhat starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder . \nthat's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy . \nand this is supposed to make sense . \nreally . \nfrom the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film . \nthe film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac's return excruciatingly boring . \nplot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin's unbelievably horrible script , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion . \neveryone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac's return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash . \nthe bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible . \nanother attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat . \nand what's with that title ? \nthe devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film . \nlet's pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series . \none of the worst horror films in years . \n""",0
"b""it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . \nall it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . \nand what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? \nand potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . \na computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . \nbut after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it . \ninstead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad . \nwith the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) \ni remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . \nit was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . \nof course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 . \ni wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares . \ni hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon . \nbroderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) . \nbut the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups . \ndavid's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove . \nif for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days . \ndavid uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers . \nthe modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on . \nfar from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum . \nthe big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today . \nwhat are the lessons we can learn from wargames ? \n1 . \nmake sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers . \n2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers ! \n""",1
"b'when you\'ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games . \nwhy did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? \nthe quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . \nthis film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . \nthe plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the "" outworld "" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity . \nthe good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined . \nhere\'s the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who\'s on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who\'s on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity\'s safety for another generation . \nhow this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana\'s line , "" i knew love would keep us together , "" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh . \nthere are some seriously stupid things in this movie . \ntake , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the "" inner winds "" , generated by earth\'s magma flows . \nyou get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast . \nhow fast ? \nas katana says , "" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all .

"b'imagine this . \nyou\'re given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training . \na man you don\'t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live . \nyou are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die . \nyou frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you . \nyou watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood . \nif you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you\'re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow . \neventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you\'re going to die . \nthis is the life of a gladiator . \nyou\'ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott\'s powerful gladiator , you\'ll be thankful for that . \nwith his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . \nand like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script . \nsince the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . \n>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . \nrome\'s best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania . \nscott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . \nit\'s blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . \nas soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . \nit\'s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . \ninstead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . \nhe wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . \nbut , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . \nthe dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . \nhe asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . \nall of this does not go well for aurelius\' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor . \njealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus\' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . \nbut maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius\' wishes . \nnow a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . \na story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . \nyou actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . \nphoenix plays his character brilliantly . \nthink of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he\'s not the center of attention . \nevery scene we see commodus , he\'s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . \nphoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he\'s more than just river\'s little brother . \ncrowe is also excellent as the film\'s grisly-faced hero . \nmaximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . \nthis guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he\'s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! \nthe rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . \nridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . \nthe visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . \nthe costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians . \ngladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . \nalong with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 . \n'",1
"b""are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? \nwafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves . \neveryweek , wafflemovies . com \nreviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video . \nhere is a sample review : \nwelcome to sarajevo \nin light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years . \nset in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war . \nthe picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding . \nas they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride . \nyet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war . \nin this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . \njoe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know . \nhis fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) . \nmichael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest . \nhenderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread . \nhe decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth . \nhenderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines . \nhe finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult . \nduring his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner . \nhe promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance . \nafter the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope . \nhowever , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans . \nunfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england . \nthe group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy . \ncan they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? \nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made . \ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . \nthey show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . \nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . \nthe group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . \none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . \nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . \nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . \nthe picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . \nwinterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . \nthis portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com \nselection mad city . \nwe watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . \nhowever , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . \nstephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . \nhe portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . \ndillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . \nhenderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . \nit is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . \nwoody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . \nharrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . \nharrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . \nthis ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . \namerica's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . \nfor those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . \nwar is a foreign concept to most of us in america . \nbattles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . \ntelevised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . \nthis picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . \n""",1
"b'who would have thought ? \njim carrey does drama . \nwhen i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" \nhowever , it was an even better premise for a drama . \nthe truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man . \nthat man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . \ntruman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . \nchristof is the "" god "" of this made-up world . \nhe keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles . \nthere were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . \nthe opening parts of the film introduce to truman\'s world . \nwe see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . \nit may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . \nthe film can be described in one word : weird . \nit seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . \nit seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew\'s idea and he did wonders with it . \njim carrey actually lived up to the hype . \nthe hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey\'s ability to do drama . \nno one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . \nand he showed them all up . \njim carrey was snubbed at the oscars . \ni do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination . \nhe plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world . \nhe has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . \nhe ventures into the wrong elevator . \na light crashes in front of him . \nhis father comes back and is then pulled away . \nwe are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . \nand it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish . \ncarrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . \nlaura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife . \nshe plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point . \npeter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman\'s escape . \nthe story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down . \ndespite carrey\'s greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman\'s world . \nhe displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created . \nhe becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . \nthe action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish . \nbut , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . \nit really makes you think . \nmaybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show . \nsome of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . \nor when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman\'s arrival . \nand when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line . \nall of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . \ni was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . \noverall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood . \njim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best . \nandrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection . \nthe truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film . \n'",1
"b'only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters . \nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \nthe premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \nthe satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \neverything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\'t any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time . \nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \nunderstandably , "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \nwe don\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \nunfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \nas for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \n . \n . \nwell , it\'s hard to say . \ni gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \n "" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \ni\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \n'",1
"b'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\'s effort . \noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane . "" \nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison\'s \'the hurricane , \' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director . \nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \nthe film details carter\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \nthe book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \n "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington . \nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \nit\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \nthe actor\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\'s length . \nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \nwashington\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \nhe doesn\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \n "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \njewison\'s best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \nsadly , though , the film\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \nthere is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \nthe canadians are good . \nthe cops are bad . \nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison . \nlove\'s gonna bust me out . "" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \nit\'s too bad . \nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than "" he\'s a racist pig . "" \ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \ncriticism has been levied against the liberties "" the hurricane "" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \nfurthermore , much of carter\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \nof course , "" the hurricane "" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\'t remove one fact : "" the hurricane "" is a highly flawed film . \nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\'s a good thing "" the hurricane "" has that actor . \ncarter has been quoted as saying , "" denzel washington is making me look good , "" but he\'s not the only one . \nwashington makes this film look good . \ndenzel washington\'s "" the hurricane . "" \nsounds pretty good to me . \n'",1
"b'what a great film . \nwhat a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film . \n>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . \na car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . \nthey mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . \nheil ! \nheil ! \nhuh ? \nshortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . \nthis is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . \ngranted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . \ni think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . \nbenigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . \nbenigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . \nit = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . \nthere are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . \nslapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . \nand although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . \nthis is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . \nthe second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . \nguido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . \nfor = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . \nfor his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds . \nwhich raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? \nwith persecution ? \nwith injustice on the worst level ? \nit+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had . \nother times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . \nsometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . \nbenigni+s guido realizes this . \nhe is the clown , but he is not a fool . \nhe sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . \nhis liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . \nit+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . \nperhaps that is a form of denial . \nperhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . \nor . . . \nperhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . \nwhatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . \nsurprisingly , it works . \nit is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . \nit+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . \nthey don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . \ni believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . \nhowever , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . \nbenigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . \nhe has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . \nit swept the italian academy awards . \ncontroversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . \nmasterful . \nmiraculous . \na must-see . \n'",1
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit\'s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \nsince then , though , disney\'s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year\'s hercules successively proving less and less potent . \nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox\'s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \nthe film\'s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she\'s resolutely smitten , and she\'s such a pure and endearing character that one can\'t help but invest their heart with her . \nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams\' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \nwhile it\'s understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto\'s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia\'s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it\'s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \nis the film\'s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n ( i\'m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film\'s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n ( she\'s the only reason i\'d even consider catching flubber . ) \nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \nhe easily milks his lovable character\'s comic moments for all they\'re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid\'s big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend . \npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars\' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel\'s father , king triton . \nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman\'s untimely death . \nnot only are mr . menken\'s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman\'s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film\'s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character\'s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \nmr . menken\'s score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken\'s fine score . \nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson\'s heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film\'s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \nduring the song\'s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney\'s limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \nthere\'s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film\'s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney\'s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox\'s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film\'s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film\'s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney\'s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \nbut although disney\'s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it\'s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney\'s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n'",1
"b'118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) \nmamoru oshii is a name that probably isn\'t very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . \noshii was the director of last year\'s best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . \none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . \nin its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . \nset in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . \nas a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . \nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . \nwith the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . \nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . \nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . \nsometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . \nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . \nthe story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . \nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . \nhowever , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . \nshinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors\' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . \nthis hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation\'s labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . \nsince that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . \n ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) \nit\'s up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2\'s own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father\'s company down with it . \nas was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . \n_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . \nit is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . \nthere are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . \nthis movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . \npatlabor\'s near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . \nthe film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? \nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? \nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor\'s alternate-1999 setting . \nas far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that\'s the only one i\'ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . \nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . \nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . \nas far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . \ni don\'t think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . \nthe cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . \nthe audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . \neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . \ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming . \nthe sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . \nas far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they\'re among the most easily-readable subtitles i\'ve ever seen for _anything_ . \nlarge enough that they don\'t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . \nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . \nalthough it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people\'s enjoyment . \nmy . \n'",1
"b""it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \nbased on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n""",0
"b'every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he\'s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . \nnot to mention an expensive one . ) \nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . \nwith action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it\'s equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . \ndirected and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . \nwhile the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . \nand boy , did he take that route ! \ni\'d say at about 165 mph or so . . . \nthe film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . \nif you\'ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . \nunfortunately , she thought she\'d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . \nonce she\'s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . \nin truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . \nit seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . \nit doesn\'t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" big mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . \nwhen they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . \nonly one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . \nand soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . \nwhat happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . \ncameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you\'re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . \nwhich features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . \nmany people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . \nwell , they would be wrong , my friends . \nif this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? \nthat\'s right , best actress . \nyou know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . \nin short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . \nthen again , maybe not . \nmovies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it\'s throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . \nso who will be the next king ? \nwell , let\'s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . \ni can\'t wait . \n'",1

"b'james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual . \na veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature . \nthey are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus . \nbut perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick . \nthe book\'s principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value . \neach of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones\' examination of world war ii on the american soldier . \nthere\'s a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . \nbut most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used . \nmalick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake . \nthe issues at stake are many and one . \ntold from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( "" c-for-charlie "" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . \nthe south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . \nand want to win the war they do . \nin an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c-for-charlie\'s commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall . \nhe\'s an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) . \nthis philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command . \nat the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt . \nwelsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them . \nthe thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it\'s nearly three hours long . \nalthough the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end . \nthe thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998\'s other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times . \nbut to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences . \ndirector malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie . \n'",1

"b'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \nstill , i can\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \nand after it , i still can\'t . \nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\'s growing estrangement from emma . \nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \nhe does get bye bye love\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well . \nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \nthis isn\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\'s all his father\'s fault he\'s such a cad . \ncarolco\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie . \nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \nit is a sad end to flanders\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \nit is left to the dads\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\'t enough . \nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \n'",0

"b'the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . \nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankind\'s struggle for survival or knowledge . \nsuch popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood\'s end "" by arthur c . clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k . dick all deal with man\'s need for identity and struggle for self worth . \nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it\'s beginnings . \nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . \nit really wasn\'t until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein\'s novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that \'sci-fi\' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it\'s own . \nfrom there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . \nwith the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . \nthe film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o\'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . \nwoody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . \nentering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . \nluc consoles jim with woody\'s assistance . \nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . \nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . \nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . \nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . \ngoing out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed \'face on mars\' . \na strange noise emanates from the rock . \nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . \nback on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . \nluc\'s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . \nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . \nmeteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet\'s surface . \nthe big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . \nand if so , what is its relationship with us ? \nnow for the bad news . \nthe entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \nthe famed \'face on mars\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \nborrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava\'s "" planet of the vampires "" ( \'terrore nello spazio\' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don\'t add up to a satisfying whole . \nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o\'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \nhe\'s just having too much fun here to give a damn . \nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \nsubtlety is non-existent here . \nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn\'t been seen since "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" . \nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage\' to hitchcock\'s "" rope "" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \nsadly it is not . \ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \nbut it\'s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . \na disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . \n'",0
"b'the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . \nsince june , i haven\'t been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha\'s "" take on me "" in his yellow miata . \nwhy would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? \nhonestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . \nman , was i wrong . \ncorky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots . \nfortunately for chris kattan\'s precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety . \nkattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny \'80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( "" you don\'t have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps .

"b'plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn\'t quite know what she wants out of life . \none day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . \nshe starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can\'t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . \ncritique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . \nthis is a "" feel-good "" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . \nit doesn\'t pretend to be deep , it doesn\'t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it\'s basically just a "" cute movie "" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it\'s quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . \none thing that this film isn\'t though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of "" best "" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . \nit actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it\'s a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren\'t as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . \nthankfully , this film doesn\'t bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . \non the whole , it\'s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . \nthe lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . \nunfortunately , the rest of the cast isn\'t as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could\'ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film\'s end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . \nnow i haven\'t seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of "" scene "" that they\'re developing over in "" le pays du vin "" , i wouldn\'t mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . \ngranted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film\'s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn\'t help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . \nin fact , i\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol\' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . \nand this guy directed alien : resurrection ? \nget outta here ! ! \nnote : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . \nit was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . \ngood stuff ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nchocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 ) \n'",1
"b'what is freedom ? \nhow does one determine who is free ? \nin 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . \nyet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . \nthat is , in essence , what steven spielberg\'s gripping drama "" amistad "" is about . \nthrough its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad "" . \non their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . \nhowever , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . \nin the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . \nthe united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . \nthe two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves . \nthe american ship that found the slaves also wants them . \nin the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . \nthey enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . \nthrough various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nthe film itself is a visual wonder . \nspielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . \nat times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . \nhowever , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . \nthe film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . \nthe characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman\'s abolitionist . \nbut spielberg\'s finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque\'s family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . \nit is this emotional force that carries the film . \nmcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . \nthe movie , however , belongs to hounsou . \nhis emotional intensity is brilliant . \nspielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film\'s extraordinary power is simply captivating . \nthe film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . \nbut that doesn\'t matter . \nthe story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . \nkudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . \na good job all around . \n'",1

"" \nphilip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . \nthrough a plot twist , hoenicker\'s goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just \'cause he\'s evil enough . \na sub-plot involves philip\'s attempts to win back sara , who\'s angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip\'s belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . \nand in another subplot , philip\'s day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . \nyuckity-yuck . \nwhat\'s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . \nyou don\'t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . \nearlier in \'97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . \ndisney\'s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . \nin the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic .

"b'it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . \nhis new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . \nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . \nit is filled with above-the-title stars . \nthe cast , for the most part , gives great performances . \njohn travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . \ngeorge clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . \none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character\'s narration . \nthe rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . \nthese actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . \nterrence malick is a cinematic legend . \nhe has often been called "" the j . d . salinger of cinema . "" \nhis two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . \nafter he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . \nthis film marks his return . \nwhat he\'s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . \nthe narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as "" i\'m scared . "" \nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . \nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . \na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . \nmany stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . \nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . \nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . \nthis basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . \ni\'m not declaring that the film has no structure . \nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . \nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . \nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . \nthis film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . \nultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . \nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . \nwhile some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . \nafter seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . \n'",1
"b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \nit\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \njim carrey\'s signed on too ? \neven better . \nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth . \nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\'t funny . \nit\'s not for lack of trying . \nthe farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \nsoon enough , charlie\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \nthis guy isn\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \nsome have suggested that this isn\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\' brand of humor doesn\'t require plot to work . \nthey\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\' last effort , 1996\'s "" there\'s something about mary . "" \n ( 1999\'s "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . ) \nthe brothers\' earlier film wasn\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \nin "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \n "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \nhaving been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \nbut they haven\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \nyeah , me too . ) \nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \nbut by the end of the film , they\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\'t been dropped either . \nthat\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \n "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities . \nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\'s actions . \nthis doesn\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\'s condition early on , so they don\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" \nit\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \ncarrey doesn\'t pull any stunts we don\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\' script doesn\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\'t set up in any meaningful way . \nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \nzellweger\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film . \nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \nafter viewing the shapeless mess that "" me , myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \nbut i don\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\'ll rebound just fine . \neven after that happens , though , i\'ll still consider "" me , myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire . \n'",0

what a cast . \nok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . \none day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . \nok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . \nnow on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . \nsalma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . \nazrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . \nbethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . \nwhat a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie . \nwho would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . \nnow for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . \nyes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . \nthis review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . \nkevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . \nof course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . \nprobably the best characters in movies that i like . \nthe star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . \nthe script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . \nchris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . \nlinda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . \nof course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . \nalan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . \nbeing oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . \nben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . \nthe movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . \nhowever the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' . \nwhile being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it . \n'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . \nall kevin smith fans must see ! ! \n""",1
