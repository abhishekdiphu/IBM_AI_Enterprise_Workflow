"b' "" when it\'s cold , molecules aren\'t moving . \neverything is clean . "" \nthese are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . \nwhen mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey\'s life and the lives that surround him . \nhis father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . \nben\'s wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn\'t say anything . \nmeanwhile , ben\'s 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations . \ntobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . \nwe start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . \nhe compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody\'s own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you\'ll return . \nthe ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . \neverything parallels everything else . \nthe young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . \n "" when it\'s cold outside , the molecules aren\'t moving . \neverything is clean . "" \neverything is clean because nobody will admit what\'s going on . \neven the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings . \nhow can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? \nall the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that\'s the point of the film . \nat first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn\'t it parallel itself ? \nyou don\'t get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that\'s because nobody in the movie knows each other either . \nwe sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . \nat first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven\'t gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . \nthe acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . \nhe doesn\'t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . \nchristina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . \nstill , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen\'s subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . \ntobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . \nhe was needed , but perhaps he should\'ve been used more . \nthe ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . \ni hate to say that i don\'t agree , but i don\'t . \nin fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . \neven so , it is a very good film . \nit takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it\'s art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn\'t before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . \nperhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes . \n'",1
"b'after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel\'s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . \nmuriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . \nshe is often the target of her father\'s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . \nher self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . \nafter her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel\'s wedding unfolds from there . \ntoni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . \ncollette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . \nshe has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . \ncollette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . \nmuriel\'s father , bill "" the battler "" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . \nwhile chumming around with young fans and crowing \'you can\'t beat progress\' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . \nrachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel\'s cheeky new friend in the film . \nshe has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . \nmuriel\'s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan\'s scripting \nmuriel\'s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . \nhogan\'s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . \nhogan\'s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel\'s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . \nthe glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . \nmuriel\'s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . \non my four star scale , i give muriel\'s wedding three stars . \n'",1

"b' "" you\'ll go ape over tarzan because it\'s more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" \nokay , there\'s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \ndisney\'s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \nit\'s amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \nmuch of tarzan\'s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \nall he\'s looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \nlook back on past disney animated features and you\'ll see the trend . \ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \none is an ape named terk ( rosie o\'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \ni\'m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \njust fill in the blanks ! \ncan you see it ? \n "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \nwe\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \nwell , there we go ! "" \nof course , there\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene . \nthankfully , those aren\'t the exact words . \nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \n "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan\'s a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn\'t that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\'s just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\'t just tarzan , it\'s "" extreme tarzan . "" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\'donnell . "" \ndistracting to say the least . \ni\'ll admit i\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i couldn\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \nbut unless you\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \nthis time , i\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \n\'nuff said . \n'",1
"b""review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . \nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \nnot that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . \nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . \n ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \nwill patrasche save the day ? \nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \nother critics , however , were not so kind . \nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \nsee it while you can . \nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \n""",1
"b'roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . \nhowever the emperor\'s evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . \nmaximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . \nproximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . \nwhen emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . \nmaximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . \ngladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking . \nthe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . \nit\'s choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . \nit\'s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . \nthe actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . \nmany times it\'s unclear as to exactly what\'s going on . . . \nall the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . \nwe\'re not sure who\'s blood or by who\'s hand though . \nthere\'s an instance of this earlier in the film too that\'s disappointing . \nit\'s comes when maximus escapes his executioners . \nsome flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . \nbut i still don\'t know exactly how he did it . \nrussell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995\'s virtuosity . \nfor whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . \nbut he should have it now . \nfrom here on moviegoers should now be able to say , "" let\'s go see the new russell crowe movie "" . \nhe gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . \nit\'s both rousing and chilling . \njoaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . \ncommodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . \nit\'s a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . \noliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it\'s a huge loss to the acting world . \ni\'ve always been fascinated with reed . . . \nhe\'s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . \nit\'s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . \nthe film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . \nreed\'s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . \nrather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . \nironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . \nanyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren\'t looking for it you won\'t even be able to tell . \nsome of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . \nand like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . \nit\'s sad that such a good film has these distractions . \nmovies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . \nkeep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . \nhowever it\'s a work of fiction that\'s great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d . \n'",1
"b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\'s "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \nwhen a movie is over , aren\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \nto be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \nthe previous incarnation of "" gloria "" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\'t completely unbearable to watch . \ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , "" who really cares ?

"" \nstarring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus \nin recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . \nin modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \'real\' life we learn very little . \nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \ni say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \nand there are ways in which it does . \nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \'realism\' of the screen . \npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \'the lord of the rings , \' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \nthis makes jordan\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \nshe adeptly blends them all together . \nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . \nthe point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl\'s rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . \na night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother\'s home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \n "" don\'t stray from the path , "" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . \nstaying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen\'s elders . \ncarter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . \nthose who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . \nthis fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . \nif straying from the path leads to death , then it\'s not a good idea--but if that\'s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it\'s worth the risk . \nwhen you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it\'s full of potential . \nand it\'s certainly more interesting than the disney version . \n'",1

"b'it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \nset in the 1940\'s , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn\'t behave more responsibly . \nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people . "" \nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut\'s wife ) a willing tutor . \ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life\'s questions . . . \nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \ncalling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what\'s eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \nregardless of one\'s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \nfiguring the rules didn\'t apply to them since they didn\'t have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \ngod has also given us a set of rules . \nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god\'s rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \nand yet , many continue to ignore his "" rules "" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \n "" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .

"b'it\'s an interesting premise . \nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \nthe matrix isn\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \nthe group\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \nwhat is reality ? \nwhat is a sham ? \nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \nreeves , whom i\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \ni mean , since bill and ted\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? \nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \nthis helps to further the aura of his character\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\'t in the picture . \nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \nof special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \npretty slick . \nthe matrix drips with style . \nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\'re used to . \nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\'s a lot of kung fu , there\'s a lot of gunplay . \nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \nthere\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \ncombined , it\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \nthe film is not without its faults . \nsome of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\'t meant to be a joke . \nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \n'",1
"b'in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \ngo see it ! \nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980\'s . \n "" hard copy "" \'s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman\'s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \nsmart replied that she thought kidman\'s character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \nsmart\'s got a point . \nit wouldn\'t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \nhowever , given a choice between the mass media \'happening\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \'on tv . \' \nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \n "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "" \nher husband beams at suzanne\'s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne\'s sexual favors . \nkidman\'s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain\'t going anywhere , ever . \nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn\'t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \'get it\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i\'ve heard since heathers . \nhenry\'s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \nall-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! \nto die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . \nwritten by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . \nrated r - for language and mature themes . \n ( respect the r , not for under 14\'s ) rating ----- stars . \ngo see it . \n'",1
"b'one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\'ve given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\' roll movie like this ?

"b"" ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . \nelijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . \ntea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . \nalso featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . \nwhile many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . \nthe main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . \nonly the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . \nand because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . \nthe script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . \nmimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . \nthe cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . \nshe seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . \nrobert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . \nelijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e . \nflipper , 1996 ) . \nhis role is also vastly underwritten . \nmorgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . \nlike duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . \nthe supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . \nok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? \nwell , yes and no . \nalthough the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . \nsadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all . \nsurprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . \nin the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . \nwhat could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . \nthe 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . \nonce again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . \nlet's hope armageddon is a bit better . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n""",0
"b'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching "" . \ni have a name for it myself : "" gross "" . \nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\'t present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ? \nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\'s intelligence . \ninstinct\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\'s "" psychotics ward "" . \nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \nand then there\'s the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\'s mentor . \nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \nlet\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \nnot good old theo . \nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now . "" \nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\'s also the least of its problems . \ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \nit\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \nit aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts . \nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\'s story . \nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\'s plot to another character . \nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \ni love animals , and instinct\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \nhowever this movie\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov \n'",0
"b' "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \nunfortunately , it\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven\'s gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad . \ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\'s "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\'s "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek ) . \nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \n "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\'s bare breasts . \n "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \ncomic books have better plots than this . \nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\'s comedy "" george of the jungle . "" \ndidn\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 ) . \nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \nof course , one can\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \nstrictly speaking , "" tarzan and the lost city "" isn\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \nthis movie proves what "" starship troopers "" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\'s like a charmless version of belloq from "" raiders of the lost ark . "" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \n "" tarzan and the lost city "" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \n'",0
"b'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nme tarzan . . . you \nhappy viewer . \nfor a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney\'s latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . \n ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? \nyikes ! ) \nbut guess what- disney , a company that\'s been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . \nthe story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who\'s lost her young adopts him into her group . \nas he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he\'s so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor\'s lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . \nfrom there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? \nthe voicework here is pretty top-level . \ntony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o\' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan\'s best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . \nthe movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . \nwhen tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol\' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . \ni couldn\'t believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . \nand the music\'s not half bad , either . \nfortunately , there\'s no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . \nthere\'s some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . \nbut , of course , it\'s not all action- there\'s a message here as well that has to do with family . \nthis is easily one of disney\'s best animated films of the decade and it\'s one i can\'t wait to put in my home library . . . that \nis , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 . \n'",1
"b' "" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . "" \nstarring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung \ntaiwan , 24/12/99 . \nthe millenium approaches . \nan incessant downpour batters an unnamed city . \nsectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus . \nthe virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners . \nthe water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week\'s time . \nresidents are advised to evacuate the area , asap . \nthis premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas . \nthe quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that . \nthe virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background . \ninstead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities . \nthe entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible . \nit\'s a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background . \nthe man lives in the apartment directly above the woman\'s . \none day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man\'s living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman\'s living room . \nthis hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character\'s lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways . \nexample : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole . \nthe woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up . \nthis is what passes for meaningful communication . \nand they say romance is dead . \nmuch of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are . \nthere is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people . \nthey are ciphers . \ninstead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles . \n ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . ) \noffered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i\'m told , in 1950s\' china ) . \nshe prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights . \nsometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man . \nthese scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail . \nwhen the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless . \nastaire and rogers this is not . \neven in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring . \nthe hole is part of the \'collection 2000\' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium . \nothers include canada\'s last night , brazil\'s midnight , and american hal hartley\'s the book of life . \nthe book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry . \nwitty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty . \namerican movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions . \nforeign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art . \nthe hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters\' alienation . \nif so , he succeeds . \nperhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don\'t . \nif it was a challenge , i wasn\'t up for it . \n'",0
"b'when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . \nwoody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he\'s my favorite . \neven martin scorsese hasn\'t had a perfect track record . \nkevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats . "" \ni mean , so far the only director who\'s made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia "" . . . all \nwhich were great ) . \nnow , i adore quentin tarantino . \nhis first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . \nbut 1995 just wasn\'t that good of a year for him . \nhe made way too many tv appearances . \nhe mispronounced jackie chan\'s name on the mtv movie awards . \nand he made this film . \n ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . \nrobert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . \ni\'ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can\'t comment on them . \nbut in this crap ensemble director\'s film , all four give pitiful efforts . \npitiful for any director , too . \nnow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . \ni\'ve never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody\'s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . \nexposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who\'s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year\'s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . \nhe\'s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . \nthe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . \nas the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . \nyea . \n ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : \nthe missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt \nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . \nthe situation is so terrible that it\'s physically painful to watch . \nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) \nstuck inside some object in their hotel room . \nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . \nyeah , that\'s what i said . \nstupid plot , inane characters who aren\'t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . \nnot even actually funny for a second . \nmy rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! \nthe wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender \nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . \nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games . \nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . \nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . \nand david proval has never overacted as much . \nand it\'s "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . \na masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . \nthe misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek \nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek\'s navel ? \nnope . \nluckily she\'s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it\'s more painful than funny . \nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \noh ! \nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year\'s party . \nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \nwas okay . \nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \nthey\'re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn\'t light . \nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it\'s campy . \ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \'cause they\'ve had hits , major or minor . \nit took quentin to realize that . \nbut the thing is , it doesn\'t seem like he realizes that . \nif he did , i\'d give this a good 3 stars . \nbut this sucked . \nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn\'t very good . \nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \nthat makes no sense . \nit\'s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \nit\'s long and it\'s just not very good . \nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \nconclusion : what\'s the moral here ? \nif you\'ve made celebrated films , don\'t do an ensemble piece . \nthey should have re-watched "" new york stories "" and then stopped in their tracks . \nnone of these have any point to them and they\'re embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors \'cause they\'re working with crap . \nbut i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin\'s next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool "" from dusk till dawn , "" which i found exhilerating ) . \ni love quentin and i suppose it\'s good he made "" the man from hollywood "" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some "" god of cinema .

"b'first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . \na sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . \nan orginal plot that grows old real fast . \none of the only 90 minute films that i\'ve gotten bored through . \nmen in black has defied the odds . \nwhen i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . \nhowever , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . \ntommy lee jones and will smith play two "" government "" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . \nthe ridiculous plot begins when an alien "" bug "" , played weirdly by vincent d\'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that\'s somewhere on "" orion\'s belt .

"b'plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . \nthis film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . \ncritique : awesome ! \ni love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so \nyes , i really dug this movie ! \nthe hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is \nvery serious ! \nin fact , it\'s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . \nit ain\'t for the kids , i\'ll tell you that much . \nand if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective "" kill scenes "" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . \nin fact , most of this film\'s structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and "" feel "" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those "" unfortunates "" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . \nyou can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . \nbut it\'s also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . \nthe theory in this film is based on the graphic novel "" from hell "" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? \nyes , the brothers even managed to slip a little "" love "" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could\'ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . \nthat\'s right , there\'s no real need to put any "" romance "" in a film about a mass murderer ! \nbut that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . \nsure , he\'s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . \ni was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp\'s character had to do with the film\'s development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn\'t ) . \non the downside , the film doesn\'t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . \nbut then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . \ni mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one\'s motives , reasons , etc . . . \nin fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i\'d been held from the film\'s characters . . . or \nam i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? \nperhaps . \noverall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola\'s dracula and burton\'s sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . \nbut it\'s not for everyone . \nsome may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren\'t shown as graphically as you might think , there\'s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . \nbut i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! \nand god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper\'s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nthe crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) \n'",1
"b""among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don't help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n""",0
"b'after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . \nspencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . \nwith the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children\'s films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . \nstar kid stands out as that rare kids\' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . \nremember , the robot ? \nit wasn\'t one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit . "" \nthe cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . \nthe significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . \ncy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool .

"b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\'s fault . \nfrom what i\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\'s legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn\'t any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n'",0
"b""in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . \nbut , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . \nin this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . \nvery often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . \nwhether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . \nthe same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . \nthe movie is set in 2018 . \nfor some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . \njake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . \nsentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . \nalthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . \njake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . \nsuch escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . \nafter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . \nthe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . \nby the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . \nof course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . \nthe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . \nlori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . \nkurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . \nlambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion . \n""",0

"b'it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of "" the horse whisperer , "" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to "" projection difficulties .

"" \nredford has taken evans\' book and given it the big screen treatment . \nwhile parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . \nwhen her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace\'s beloved horse , pilgrim . \nrefusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . \nundeterred by tom\'s initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . \nredford\'s film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . \nthe film\'s a little long and , even if you haven\'t read the book , it\'s pretty obvious where it\'s heading--but these are minor complaints . \nredford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it\'s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . \ndianne wiest , chris cooper ( "" lone star "" ) , and sam neill--better than i\'ve seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . \nand the director\'s respect for horses is clearly in evidence . \none word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . \nredford\'s canvas is huge and exquisite . \nhe doesn\'t hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson\'s viewfinder . \nveteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since "" the horse whisperer "" is "" dances with wolves "" by way of "" out of africa "" ( oscar winners both for barry ) . \nfortunately , barry\'s replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . \n "" the horse whisperer "" is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . \nthe wait , it turns out , was well worth it . \n'",1
"b'the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . \ngeez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! \nsorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . \nthe pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . \nneedless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder\'s legs ! \nbut despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i\'ve now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! \ni\'m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! \nthat may be the most memorable scene , but it\'s certainly not the only worth watching . \nstephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . \nit\'s a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . \nrescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer\'s "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner . \nboth the script and kathy bates\' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . \nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she\'s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she\'s just damned scary ! \nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \nit\'s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it\'s basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it\'s a remarkable piece of cinema . \nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner\'s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \noh , i haven\'t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who\'s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \nalong with the pig , of course ! \nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \nthere\'s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \nhe succeeds , but . . . she \nknocks the glass over ! \ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - "" d\'oh ! !

"b'it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . \nno major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . \nthe americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . \nsmall wonder that hollywood\'s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . \nthere\'s little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government\'s been long worried about the younger people getting "" americanised "" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . \nthe people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . \ndoes pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? \nlarry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . \nbut even with such actions , americans remain undecided . \nthe oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . \nwhat they have ignored is actually a great picture . \nwoody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . \nand he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . \nthe latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . \nedward norton plays their jerky lawyer . \nthe relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who\'ve had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . \ngod\'s damnation . \nbut in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . \nfriedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . \nto go beyond good and evil . \nthis is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . \nbecause it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . \nbut i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . \nthere are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . \nthis movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . \n'",1
"b' "" varsity blues "" is the best film of 1999 thus far . \nunfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . \nit is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . \nit is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game . "" \nby the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? \nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \nwill the team win the climactic game ? \ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \nthe so-called "" hero "" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \nat least he\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\' big win the night before . \nwhen the team\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the "" bad guy "" ) . \nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\'t win their final game . \nthe plotting of "" varsity blues "" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\'s "" all the right moves . "" \none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\'s "" dawson\'s creek "" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \nwhile i probably shouldn\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and "" by-the-numbers "" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in "" all the right moves . "" \nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\'t think i\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \nsmart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \nit\'s too bad the camera didn\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \njohn\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\'t want any part of that . \nhis mother stands beside her "" big , strong husband "" and is a passive female . \nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \nsaving "" varsity blues "" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \nno , we don\'t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \n "" varsity blues , "" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \n'",0

"b'while watching wes anderson\'s rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film\'s anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . \nthe young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . \nschwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like "" serpico "" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . \non the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore\'s baseball field ) in her honour . \nunfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max\'s plans to woo her . \nmax is one of the best-written characters we\'ve yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . \nas everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from "" the wonder years "" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . \nhopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . \nbill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven\'t yet seen from him . \nwhile this isn\'t his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . \nwilliams isn\'t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . \nrushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn\'t a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . \nanderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . \n'",1
"b'so i went and saw this film right , it was called "" battlefield : earth "" , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it . \nwell let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it\'s safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than "" mr . magoo "" , "" blue in the face "" , or "" jaws : the revenge "" . \nroger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as "" alien "" and "" star wars "" , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it\'s quite depressing . \nthe look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times . \nthe sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i\'ve heard . \nthe acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous . \nhere\'s the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i \nwonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those "" man-animals "" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999\'s "" the green mile "" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! \none thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn\'t work . \nof course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) \nforest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind . \nour friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair . \ni\'m not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it\'s terrible . \neverything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren\'t good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted . \nin fact i don\'t remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . \nin fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . \nthroughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn\'t . \nmy advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more . \n'",0
"b'oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! \nin a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air . \nit\'s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn\'t . \nit\'s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn\'t . \nand , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . \neven if it\'s based on a true story , a true story which hasn\'t yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . \nhell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . \nyet it\'s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . \nweird . \nthis is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn\'t see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler\'s list . "" \nin short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . \nafter all , apart from the obvious it\'s-a-holocaust-film and it\'s-a-spielberg-film , isn\'t "" schindler\'s list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . \n "" a civil action "" is the same way : it\'s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . \nand it\'s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . \nthe main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it\'s an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that\'s not necessarily the problem with the film . \nit\'s that it\'s just kind of unsatisfying . \nif this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . \nbut this film just seems to end , and i don\'t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won\'t bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \nbut the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \nit\'s rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who\'s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he\'s manipulative and he always wins . \nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don\'t fully believe it . \nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film\'s conclusion that of incompleteness . \nin the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \nin short , he\'s full of bullshit and we know it . \nin the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \npoint one , it\'s not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren\'t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \npoint two , it has been through several lawyers . \nafter turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town\'s company . \nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \nas we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \nas macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \nin fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \nsuppose like a grisham novel ) . \nthis wouldn\'t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he\'s seen as being still full of bullshit . \nbecause he doesn\'t take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \nthe final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian\'s mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he\'s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he\'s not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film\'s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it\'s still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \nit only feels like half of that . \nmaybe even less . \nand it\'s not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \nup to then , though , it\'s an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it\'s about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can\'t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \nand duvall\'s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it\'s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \nfacher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \nbut look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it\'s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \nthat\'s why i liked this film : it\'s hard to put a pointer on . \nyou can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren\'t sure what to make of it . \ncall it the zallian effect . \nsame thing happened with "" schindler\'s list "" ( not that i\'m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \neach film is so greatly crafted that you can\'t help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \nif only it felt totally complete ( like , say , "" schindler\'s list , "" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \n'",1
"b'the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\'s army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n'",1
"b'barb wire , pamela anderson lee\'s first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . \nbeing the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character\'s catch line , "" don\'t call me babe , "" sound very ironic indeed . \nfrom the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . \nthroughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson\'s , then at least of the female extras . \nthis alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . \nfor a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . \nit is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . \nknown for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . \nin between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . \neven the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . \nthere are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of "" barb wire .

"b'my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . \ni didn\'t see the first film until much later . \nso looking back , the original didn\'t hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn\'t think too much of it when i initially saw it . \nwatching it now for a second time confirmed that it\'s an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever . \nyou all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before . \nthis first installment does an adequate job with it\'s low budget , but there\'s some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . \nplus the movie\'s ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . \nand does anyone understand what happens to nancy\'s mother at the end of this film ? \ndon\'t get me wrong though . . . \nit\'s not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . \nmost horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . \nhorror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn\'t cut it . \na nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set . \nthe film is presented in both pan and scan and it\'s original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) . \nthe film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix . \nalso included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film\'s director of photography . \nother extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i\'m sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film\'s original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film\'s original theatrical trailer . \nsome dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don\'t have dvd-rom capabilities i can\'t really get into that . \nthe commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular . \nthe first thing of note is that it\'s the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago . \ni\'m not saying that\'s a negative thing , just pointing it out . \neveryone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn\'t say much at all . \nmost of the time you\'ll forget he\'s even there . \neveryone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they\'re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible . \nthe bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series . \nalso included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . . \nhowever you can only access one easily . \nthe other is hidden in what\'s called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created . \nbasically , it\'s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film . \nfinding it though is both a chore and a bore . \n[r] \n'",0
"b' "" gattaca "" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\'s a genre picture that doesn\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as "" in-valids "" and confined to the lower rung of society . \nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \neveryday , he watches as "" superior "" folk make his fantasy a reality . \ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\'t know is a lie . \nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\'s cover and derail his goal . \neven if "" gattaca "" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama "" the truman show "" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\'s clinical chill . \nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \nin "" gattaca "" \'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \nalthough it\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , "" gattaca "" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \n'",1
"b'is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? \ni was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \n "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \nhowever , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be\'s is getting to me . \nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \nit\'s a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \nthat\'s why i\'m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \nfrom what i\'ve seen of their movies ( "" kiki\'s delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \nthese movies , particularly "" kiki\'s delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \n "" kiki\'s delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \nthis is unusual because kiki isn\'t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki\'s mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she\'s discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \nkiki\'s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn\'t seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \nthey\'re three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950\'s . \nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \ni could probably go on all day , but i won\'t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \nsome of my favorites are kiki\'s relationship with the baker\'s husband : although he\'s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \nin the garage of a deliveree\'s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don\'t even want to hint at it . \nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i\'ve ever seen ; if you don\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \n "" beauty and the beast "" \'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for "" kiki\'s delivery service "" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\'s flights . \nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\'ve ever seen . \ni\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of "" monoko hime "" shortly following the summer \'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \ni\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\'s good to know that it\'s being released at all , for "" kiki\'s delivery service "" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \nwatch this movie . \nalong with "" man bites dog , "" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i\'ve ever seen . \n'",1
"b'the spy game is up . \nyou can thank charlie\'s angels -- the movie -- for that . \nwhen did banality and pandering become okay ? \njust steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that\'s a movie ? \ncharlie\'s angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i\'ve seen in ages . \ncharlie\'s angels is dumb . \njust plain dumb . \nas we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie . \nthey all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don\'t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion . \nand while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party . \nthe actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company . \nof course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe . \nthe amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels\' hair . \nthe coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie\'s manservant , or , more to the point , the angels\' pimp . \nthe rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke\'s long-lost brother . \ncharlie\'s angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight . \nnothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels\' actions . \nit feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one . \ndiaz is a knucklehead . \nbarrymore is the "" dangerous one , "" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role . \nliu is just . . . \nlucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit . \nthe list of movies from which charlie\'s angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing . \nthe writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan\'s movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv\'s friends . \nit\'s a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year\'s favorite , go . \nthen again , what can you expect from a director known solely as "" mcg .

"b'i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i\'m watching a movie . \ni don\'t even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night . \nit\'s the only show that\'s worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don\'t watch reruns , i\'m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . \ni am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . \nand i love gillian anderson . \nthe x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . \nthe film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . \nthis is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . \ni expected to like it more than any episode i\'ve seen , and my expectations were met . \nactually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . \nwhen the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . \nthe film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \nbut wait , i\'m getting ahead of myself . \nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \nthe alien\'s blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \nas i\'ve written before , it\'s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they\'re in the alien spacecraft , you\'ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we\'re not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn\'t required to understand the film . \nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i\'ll keep those as surprises . \nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \nit\'s original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she\'s also a strong actress . \nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \nit\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \nit\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \nactually , it\'s nice to see a risk at all . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \nit\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\'s oddly fascinating . \nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \nif not , then i\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \ntramps about in the woods . \nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \nleggings ) . \ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \ni won\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \nthis movie is really stupid . \nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \nthe movie doesn\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \nshe\'s of the "" new people "" ; they\'re of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . "" \nyep . \nwe get it . \nwe get it . \nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \nthe face-painting that\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \nadd to this the film\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\'ve seen in quite a while . \nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\'m sure , it\'s so cheesy that it probably won\'t bother most people . \nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \n'",0

"" \nnobody will ever know , but as a novelty , sgt . \npepper\'s is one to examine . \ncarol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they\'re all here . \nbut why ? ? ? ? \nwho knows . \nit\'s irrelevant . \nthere\'s as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly-button lint , although the latter may be more interesting . \nwith the recent onslaught of 70\'s nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) , let\'s pray this doesn\'t get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters . \nin the words of paul mccartney , live and let die . \nin fact , bury this one while you still can . \n'",0
"b'james cmaeron\'s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . \nfor those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . \nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . \nhowever , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . \nto stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor\'s mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . \nin response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . \nimages of machines and of humans\' reliance on machines dominate the film . \neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . \nin the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . \nin the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . \ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he\'s not happy about it . \nunabated technological growth brings about the terminator\'s other obsession : the apocalypse . \nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . \nchildren watch the flames in a burning television . \nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . \neven though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . \nall sara can do is await it . \n ( cameron doesn\'t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) \nthe end of the world is the human race\'s own fault , too . \nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . \nback in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron\'s ) . \nthese days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . \ntrue , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield\'s and lance henriksen\'s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . \ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . \nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . \narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . \nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger\'s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . \ncameron and hurd\'s script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . \nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese\'s intentions . \ncameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . \neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . \nthe violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom\'s heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator\'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . \nfor a low budget film , the terminator\'s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . \nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . \nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . \none thing that doesn\'t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton\'s hairdo . \n'",1
"b'this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . \nthere are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood\'s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . \nthis is the best we\'ve seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 ) . \nthis film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . \nin the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives "" . \none day , andy broke woody\'s arm off , while playing with him . \nwoody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . \nlater andy\'s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son\'s room . \nsince one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . \nalthough his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . \nthe cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody\'s roundup .

"b'up until about a year ago , john travolta\'s career consisted of those "" look who\'s talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who\'s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn\'t everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \nbut now travolta\'s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \nfour words : contract with the devil . \nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich\'s "" contract with america . "" \nno , satan is much more humane . \nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \nhow do i know ? \ni own the document in question . \namazing what you can buy at those collector\'s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn\'t it ? \nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \nhe goes to collect some of the mafia\'s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that\'s beside the point . \npalmer is determined to get hackman\'s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \nit doesn\'t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who\'s the boss ? "" \nto speechless . \nit works in this case , unlike "" who\'s the boss ? "" \nalthough it\'s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman\'s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta\'s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \nthis movie doesn\'t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i\'ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \ni\'m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \nare you getting this , shorty ? \n'",1
"b""synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . \nif she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . \ntraining , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . \nthrow in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . \nreview : the title of this movie turned me off at first . \ni mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? \nthe other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned . \ni went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . \nto my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . \nmoore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . \nthe storyline is simple . \nanne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \ntraining . \njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \nnonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \njordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . \nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \nroyce ( what is his surname ? \ndo we care ? ) \nalmost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . \ni still liked it though . \nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \nas we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \nthis is an individual's fight for self-advancement . \nwe don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . \nit's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not . \n""",1
"b'that\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \nthere weren\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \nit\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \nit\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\'s head in joan cusack\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\'s pregnant girlfriend she has "" a big pussy , "" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \nwhy a child psychologist ? \nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \nkid : my dad\'s an asshole . \ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \nkid : my dad\'s a _huge_ asshole . \nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\'s equally annoying friend\'s wife is also pregnant . \nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed "" arnie the dinosaur "" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \nthat\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line "" now it\'s time to take a look at your volvo , "" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \nhugh grant\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\'s nervous smiles . \neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \nbut at least they didn\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \n'",0

"" \nthe film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . \nthe son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . \nthere he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . \nto bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . \nflynt , along with the magazine\'s rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody\'s real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . \nthey mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on "" what guys really want , "" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . \nthe film\'s prime example of hustler\'s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt\'s "" naughtiness .

"b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \nyes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\'harra , han\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\'s sister years ago . \nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \ni\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\'t like that particular genre . \n'",1
"b""this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 . \nthe avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt . \nthe question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? \nthe same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin . \ni feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie . \nmy greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . \nthe dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves . \none wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality . \nconnery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes . \nhis dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality . \nif there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice . \nfor one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title . \ni cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you . \n""",0
"b'luckily , some people got starship troopers . \nsome people knew it was supposed to be silly . \nfor those of you who didn\'t , how could you miss it ? \nfrom the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . \ni guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don\'t recognize such goofy humor . \nsuch a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . \nfirst thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . \nmeet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers "" . \nfour close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . \njohnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . \ndizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it\'s possible she\'s joining merely to follow rico , whom she\'s always had eyes for . \nif you saw these three on the street , you\'d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie\'s cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine . \nthe lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . \n ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . \nright off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . \nbut a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . \nwith his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . \nwell sorry , rico suave , but there\'s no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . \nthat\'s right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn\'t going to destroy . \nwith a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . \nwhat starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . \nit\'s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it\'s not as recognizably so . \nit\'s a spoof so subtle that many won\'t recognize the spoofery . \nif you deem this as sci-fi/action , you\'re wrong . \nit\'s sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . \ngore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . \nyes , it\'s graphic , but it\'s also brutally phony , and that\'s what makes it such great fun to watch . \nnot since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . \npeople were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . \nperhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters\' barbie dolls as young children . \nwith the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it\'s a good chance this is the case , whether we\'re fully aware of it or not . \nstarship troopers has it\'s slow parts , but it\'s truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . \naside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . \nwhen the spaceship passes a meteor , it\'s quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . \nif you\'re looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . \na beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . \nthis is brainless heaven . \njust remember not to think . \n'",1
"b""disconnect the phone line . \ndon't accept the charges . \ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . \ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . \nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \n`georgia' . \nmaddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . \nryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . \nkudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . \nditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \nher frenzy is apparent . \nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . \nbut really , it's no mystery . \nthe predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . \npin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . \nit's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . \nuh-uh . \nit's a wrong number from the beginning . \n""",0
"b""phew , what a mess ! \nfor his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on . \nshe not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him . \nis one of jerry's conjectures correct ? \n * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? \nis oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? \nis this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? \nno , no , and no . \nas it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background . \n ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . ) \nthe * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip . \nmel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating . \n ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? ) \neven when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair . \nthere's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container . \n ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . ) \nother hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion . \n ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . ) \nlet's see , other pleasures include . . . \na brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall . \noh , pretty woman ! \ngetting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story . \nthe last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable . \nmore stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts . \nand here i thought it was wabbit season . \ngood god , who rewrites these movies ? \nand do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ? \n""",0
"b'jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998\'s lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . \nit only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . \nwould this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? \nlet\'s find out . \nplot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . \nthat\'s when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother\'s death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . \ncritique : three words : not enough action ! \nsimple enough ? \nnot enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . \nand a romance angle ? \nwhy , one must ask . . . why ? \ni love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . \nand i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? \nhow \'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? \nwhat a letdown . \neven black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . \nin fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the "" hits "" for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called "" screenplay "" . \ni felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . \nthe sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn\'t matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . \nbut no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren\'t too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . \nand what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he\'s the overlord of a drug ring ? ! \nwhat a mess . \nthen again , i don\'t want it to seem like i\'m complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . \nwell , i guess that\'s what disappointed me the most out of this film . \nthere were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . \nalso , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . \nit should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! \nthe one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn\'t save the rest of this film\'s uninteresting plot movements . \ni\'m disappointed for jet li that this film didn\'t give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . \nhopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . \nfor now , i just hope that for his sake , the film\'s title isn\'t a premonition of the movie\'s ultimate fate at the box-office . \n'",0

"b""starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \nsure . \nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \nif it was the latter , it worked . \ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \nby the end of the movie you won't care . \nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \n""",0

"b""synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation . \nfang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese . \nthe encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters . \nopinion : sometimes a film is plot driven . \nsometimes it's a character sketch . \na great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family . \nfang's family is thoroughly americanized . \nfang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss . \nhis wife can't cook chinese . \nhis son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl . \nmeanwhile fang's beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit .

"b'will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that\'s usually a death sentence . \nit\'s a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn\'t die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it\'s quite fresh and original . \nit\'s a character study more than anything , and that\'s not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he\'s a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he\'s not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe\'s proud of , and amazed by , will\'s accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn\'t really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau\'s heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit\'s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau\'s "" a "" list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will\'s mockery . \nlambeau\'s last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean\'s emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe\'s not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that\'s not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn\'t start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit\'s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it\'s not quite larger than life . \nthis isn\'t a problem per se , but at times i didn\'t know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn\'t just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n'",1
"b'i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean\'s war picture . \ni still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \nand i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . \nbut i can\'t deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents . \nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \na batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\'t work as simple workmen . \nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \nand the film doesn\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" . \nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . \nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \nthat means , the picture isn\'t perfect . \nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \n "" the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people\'s minds . \nit shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \nand lean\'s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \ndavid lean\'s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . \nhis film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . \nthe film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . \nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \nthe other actors deliver fine performances as well . \ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \n ( c ) karl rackwitz ( klein k ? ris , germany , 1999 ) \n'",1
"b'i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . \nthey will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . \nit becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . \nfrequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . \noften i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . \nfilm is a different medium . \nit is a visual medium . \nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . \ni frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . \nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media . \nthe insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner . \nit is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . \nit really verges on being tedious at least at times . \nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects . \nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . \nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . \nthe tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . \nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . \nwho were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? \nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \nand in the end , he failed . \nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \nwigand\'s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \nin spite of the secrecy , wigand\'s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \nand so the game begins . \nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director\'s control . \nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",0
"b'carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" \nbernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . \nthere are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he\'s at work ( at the railway station ) . \nsid james\' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . \nhe has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! \nthe film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital\'s pills with panic ensuing . \nthere are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous \'matron\'s\' . \nwilliams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn\'t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . \nthe same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . \nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor\'s talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it\'s good storyline and it\'s other appealing characters . \nthis film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! \n'",1
"b'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody\'s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films\' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul\'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can\'t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn\'t been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul\'s anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he\'s had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit\'s early in the year , it\'s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell\'s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you\'re won over . \none thing that\'s been bothering me since i\'ve seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn\'t like tracy\'s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there\'s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere\'s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n'",1

"" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . \nthe participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . \nvarious amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . \nscreenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . \nthe most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill\'s encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen\'s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family\'s stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . \nthe pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman\'s script builds the laughs . \nwithout going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler\'s touring car , to eva braun\'s dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . \nrat race\'s cast is first rate . \ncleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese\'s deadpan assistant , a man "" born without a personality . "" \nthe film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . \nalong with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! \nand ruthless people . \na throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . \nthis is a fun little feature . \nthe only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . \nrat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you . \n'",1
"b'for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . \nin the early to mid 1400\'s , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . \nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . \nfrance was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england . \nthere was no strong political leadership in the country . \nmorale was low , there being little hope for the future . \nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions .

"b'the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man\'s life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . \nthematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni\'s neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . \nthrough a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . \nlife * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . \nliving in 1930\'s italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \nalthough dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . \nunfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . \nit is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie\'s theme of family love becomes the strongest . \nalthough prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son\'s happiness . \nnow , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . \nbenigni\'s performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . \nthe supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . \nlife is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . \nin certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a "" saturday night live "" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie\'s second half the script\'s circular nature becomes admirably obvious . \ncharacters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot\'s outcome . \nin all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first "" artsy "" film . \nlife is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . \n'",1

"b'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\'s memoir angela\'s ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i\'m important ! "" \nmccourt\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . "" \nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn\'t sound like much of a plot . \nthat\'s probably because it isn\'t one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\'t like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\'s superb poster . \nit is breen\'s first feature film and he\'s extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\'s soul through breen\'s sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven\'t read the book , but i\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\'m suspicious . \nanother thing that\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\'s ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n'",1
"b'there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical "" naked gun "" films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he\'s committed himself to starring in since . \nthe wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable . \nto be fair , "" wrongfully accused , "" the send-up in question and nielsen\'s third parody since the last "" gun , "" isn\'t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his "" dracula : dead and loving it "" or "" spy hard , "" which is a mighty good thing . \nnielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon . \n "" wrongfully accused "" meshes together the premises of "" the fugitive "" and "" patriot games , "" casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) . \nshe , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) . \nharrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones\' already smirky oscar-winning role ) . \nthere\'s also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . \n "" wrongfully accused "" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted "" lord of the violin "" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . \nnice touch . \nmost of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . \n ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and "" baywatch "" goofs . ) \nmovie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . \nwhen a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la "" anaconda "" or baseball players disappear into a "" field of dreams "" -esque cornfield , there\'s really nothing to laugh at . \nother moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you\'re not sure what you\'re supposed to be laughing at . \nthere seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it\'s possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . \nand what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those "" naked gun "" s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember "" wrongfully accused "" as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . \nthe movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of "" mafia !

"b'i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . \nand i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . \nwriter/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . \nconvinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every "" thou shalt not "" of the ten commandments into a "" thou shalt "" ( and vice versa ) . \nhis wife\'s sister rachel ( "" friends "" \' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel\'s selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . \nthus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . \ntaplitz isn\'t interested in treating seth\'s tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . \ncomposer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth\'s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn\'s performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . \nthe actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . \nthe result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . \nit\'s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . \ncorporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth\'s "" false witness .

"b'synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . \ndiedre easily cons david\'s not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she\'s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david\'s quick-tempered son , michael . \ndiedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . \ncomments : the ex is a very bad movie . \ni haven\'t seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . \ni kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . \nas summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . \ni\'m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . \nthe ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn\'t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . \nthose involved in the movie realize they\'re in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . \nthe ex\'s storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . \ndiedre , david\'s first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it\'s not as though she\'s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . \ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . \nthough david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . \nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she\'s a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . \ntime and time again , things do not add up in this movie . \nif a viewer can\'t accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . \nif , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he\'ll probably like it much better . \ni don\'t mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . \neven when viewed from an it\'s-so-bad-it\'s-good angle , this movie isn\'t all that successful . \nthe ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . \nthese two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . \nthe truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . \nbutler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that\'s unbelievably inane . \nwhen she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states "" i\'m so sorry , your lease is terminated . "" \nor how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? \n ( diedre\'s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it\'s not her\'s . \ntherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : "" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \noh , that\'s right . \n\'i\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \' "" \nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \nthe audience doesn\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\'t believe they\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \nnick mancuso\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts "" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! "" \n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \ni won\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\'s to spy upon them , that "" she\'s crazy . "" \nyou\'d be pretty crazy too if you\'d rented this turkey . \ni\'d avoid it unless it\'s on tv and you come across it . \nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\'t spend money renting it . \n'",0
"b""mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . \nthe first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . \nheck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . \neither way look out america bean is coming . \nwell , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . \nthat much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . \nit achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . \nthe whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . \nthe movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . \ndon't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . \nbut if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . \nthe movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . \nnow when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . \nwell , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . \ni have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . \nalthough the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . \ni think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . \nnow the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . \ni think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . \na different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . \none thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . \ntv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . \ni can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . \nbean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . \nnow another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . \nthe form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . \nbut if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . \nbut to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . \nthere are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one . \n""",0
"b'not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . \nlike bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters\' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . \nalso like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters\' ravished and wracked faces . \nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman\'s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . \nall that is missing is a discussion of god . \nwhich is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . \nin fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . \nnonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film\'s rhythms . \nonce the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . \none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . \nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergman\'s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple\'s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all . \nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . \nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . \nit is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . \nmuch has been made of brenda blethyn\'s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . \nthere are a few missteps . \nfor one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . \nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . \nand occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . \nfor all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . \nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . \nin fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . \nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the film\'s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . \nnonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . \nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . \nneedless to say , it is also very depressing at times . \nbut for many of us , of course , so is life . \nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . \n'",1
"b'some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese\'s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \'80s . \nsince there are still a number of \'80s films that i haven\'t seen , i don\'t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i\'ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \nit\'s rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \'40s and \'50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion\'s share of the details culled from la motta\'s own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie\'s "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \nthe two people who spar with him on life\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \nvicki becomes jake\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" ) \nin the late \'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \nby the late \'50s and early \'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \nsylvester stallone\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \nwhile scorsese\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \nthere\'s little i can say here that hasn\'t already said about de niro\'s performance . \nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \nand , although there\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \nhow many actors would go that far ? \nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\'s . \npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\'s startling to behold . \nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \nlater , she\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color ) . \nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \n ( one important recent exception , schindler\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \nthere\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\'s perspective . \nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \nafter that , his career was all downhill . \nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\'s future . \nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \n ( "" i coulda been a contenda . "" ) \nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \'80s . \nand , if not , it\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \n'",1
"b""eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . \nknown for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . \nwith the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . \nlife was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . \ndirector ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . \nlife is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . \namazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . \nas the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . \nthere he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . \nsomehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . \nwhen all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . \nhence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . \nthe film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . \nluckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . \nnot only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . \nmurphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . \nthis is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . \nwhile the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . \nbut the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . \nthe movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . \ni could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . \nit's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . \n""",1
"b'many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i\'ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\'s and stepahne\'s characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . "" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart\'s personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n'",1

"" \nhe meets the show\'s other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . \nthey have all been anxiously awaiting woody\'s arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . \nthis means woody now faces a difficult choice . \nwith his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? \nas in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human . "" \nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \nthere are so many impressive sequences that i\'d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody\'s captor . \npixar\'s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \n "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn\'t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it\'s downright touching . \nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it\'s a sequel . \nthe reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original\'s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \nnot this one . \nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \n "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \nthere are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \'em sock \'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug\'s life "" and the 1997 short "" geri \'s game . "" \n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody\'s broken arm . ) \nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \n "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \nit\'s rare to see a film like "" toy story 2 "" come along , because it\'s the kind of film that\'s almost impossible to dislike . \nit\'s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it\'s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \nit\'s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 .

"b'matthew broderick and high school comedy . \nthe two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . \nnow it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . \nferris buehler\'s day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . \nit was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . \nbut election is far different . \nthis production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . \njim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . \nhe is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . \nin turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . \njim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl . \nshe is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . \nso , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . \nthe metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . \nthe father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . \nthe mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . \nand the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . \npaul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . \ntammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . \nfor reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . \nhe claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . \nso paul agrees and the race is on . \nbut then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . \nher campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . \nwell , "" i don\'t even want to go to college , "" she says . \nin election , there are no "" good guys "" . \nalmost everyone has their own agenda . \nno matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . \ntracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . \nshe is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . \njim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . \neveryone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul\'s girlfriend are two sided characters . \nthat is much of this film\'s beauty , it doesn\'t have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . \nmatthew broderick couldn\'t have been any more perfect for this role . \nhis character is often similar bill murray\'s award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . \nof the two acting jobs , broderick\'s is far superior . \nbut even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . \nthe hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . \nbroderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . \none such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . \nyou can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . \nand his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . \nthe supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . \nbut that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . \nhowever , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . \nthis is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . \nshe is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . \nif ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . \nbut don\'t you dare think that election\'s goals are similar . \nit is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . \nthere certainly is no pile of marshmallows here . \n'",1
"b'the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . \nwatching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . \nwhen the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . \nthis is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . \ngood surprises make movies fun to watch . \nthen there are the bad twists . \nyou either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i\'m talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . \nscrewed perfectly suits the latter description . \nwhat starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . \nby the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . \nlarry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . \nwhoops . \nscrewed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . \nnorm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . \nwhen he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock\'s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . \ntoo excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers\' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . \nnow crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . \nof course , everything that could go wrong does . \nthe first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . \nbut the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . \nthe more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . \nat one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : "" no , you idiot ! "" \ni\'m not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i\'m also talking about the cops in this film . \na monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one\'s daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . \nthey give real cops bad names . \nalso poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . \nlooking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . \nhe just didn\'t belong in this movie . \nmacdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . \nif you\'re a fan of norm macdonald\'s other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . \notherwise , don\'t get screwed out of your hard-earned money . \n'",0

"" \n--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . \nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . \nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . \ninstead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . \napril loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . \nin actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . \nwhen april turns down dick\'s demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . \ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . \n ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i\'m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) \napril\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \ni\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews "" . \nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\'m afraid that it\'s one that i just don\'t get . \ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \ni\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \nagain , maybe i\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \ndespite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \nspeaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain\'t ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \n "" i\'m a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \nit\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \none particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \nonce the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \nwait . aren\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \noh , never mind . \n'",0
"b' "" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn . "" \nstarring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen \nit might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone . \nit is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward . \nhe loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays . \nwithin a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced . \na conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation . \nlauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm . \nshe notes that they haven\'t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet . \nhe says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves . \nit would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn\'t spoken with such resigned weariness . \nthis sets the tone for the rest of the movie . \nthere is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity . \nthere is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters . \nlauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion . \nthey go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l\'atalante and l\'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy . \ntheir house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances . \nthe art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters\' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . \nthere is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . \ntheir downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . \nit must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film\'s great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona\'s misfortunes . \nirony would be an injustice . \nsituations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . \nthe emotions are authentic . \nif it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that\'s because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . \nhe shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife\'s former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . \nall this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . \nif most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . \nbut what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . \ni have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . \nit does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . \nit is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . \nthere is no selling point . \nit is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . \nthe characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . \nthis does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . \nit engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . \nthe only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters\' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . \ntheir persistence is rewarded with what might be called a "" feel-good "" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . \n'",1
"b'i\'m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i\'m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . \nhowever , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . \ni didn\'t like it . \nif i had to summarize this film , i think i\'d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . \nthat\'s the kernel of it , anyway . \ntossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . \nunfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they\'re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . \nactually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . \nthey came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . \nthey laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it\'s rather frightening direction . \nthree women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . \none night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . \nin seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . \nhe soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women\'s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . \neven worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . \nanyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon\'s character . \nwe never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . \nas for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson\'s acting ) , he still can\'t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . \nand then there\'s the special effects . \nnot in themselves--they weren\'t that good--but their overuse . \ni was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt . \nnope , it\'s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , "" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet "" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn\'t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . \nf\'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! \nlet him loose ! \nlet him grin demonically ! \nskip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! \nwatching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , "" what a waste "" . \nif you\'re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . \nnicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he\'s not sure what he should be doing next . \nand no wonder . \nthis script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it\'d just love to be allegory , but it\'s not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it\'ll think of something . \nso what is the witches of eastwick ? \na horror movie ? \na folk tale ? \na comedy ? \na statement about women ? \nan examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? \ni tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching \nsomeone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . \nin other words , a mess . \n ( $2 . 00 ) \nif you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . \n'",0
"b'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \n . \n . \nscream 2 ! \n1996\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what\'s been done . \n . \n . \nand finish what hasn\'t ! \nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \nthis is in large part due to williamson\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\'re not bound to complain . \ni will note , however , that the "" whodunit ? "" \ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \nall the actors outdo themselves here . \nwe\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\'t seem off-kilter from it\'s predecessor . \nit\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \nwe skip two years , but there doesn\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \nit flows so well that you feel more like you\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\'s precursor . \nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \nthis doesn\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\'s own while maintaining it\'s sought-after qualities . \nif ever a film followed it\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\'t for the fact that two movies don\'t really make a series . \nit\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \nlike they say , don\'t mess with perfection . \n . \n . \nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\'s gonna listen ? \n'",1
"b""in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . \nlittle did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . \nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . \nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . \nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \nit just happened to work out for him . \nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \n , \n""",1
"b'a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \nit\'s jeroen krabb ? \'s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can\'t forget their bitter past . \nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can\'t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don\'t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn\'t talk . \nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn\'t gone away there\'s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman\'s book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \nit starts off telling chaja\'s story of how she\'s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can\'t be forgotten . \nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja\'s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \ntopol\'s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can\'t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja\'s loving care he\'s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \'quack , quack\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy\'s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \ni felt i didn\'t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \nunless i was mistaken and the film\'s real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \n'",0

"b'there\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \ni\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause we\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \ntelevision is what\'s wrong with deep impact . \nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \nshe thinks it\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \n "" i know you\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being .

"b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\'s complete attention . \nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "" process "" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his "" process .

"b' "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , "" friend "" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "" right "" or the "" wrong "" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n'",1

"b""movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \n""",0
"b""running time approximately 1hr 40mins \nreviewed by jack choo \nrating : \nthe movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come . \nthe story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red . \nexistenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game . \nsupposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality . \n * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz . \nplayers are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience . \nduring a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) . \n * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt . \nas they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . \nexistenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . \neven so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . \nnot even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . \nexistenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up . \nwhile in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . \nin existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else . \njennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film . \nthe scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category . \nit was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) \nwhich is actually quite good . \nexistenz is too predictable and cliched in these times . \n10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg . \ncronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you . \n""",0
"b""depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \n""",0

"b'godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie . \na loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin\'s big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . \nthe script isn\'t just "" dumbed down , "" it\'s lobotomized . \ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . \npresumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . \nthat\'s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they\'re just not as readily susceptible . \nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . \nstargate was a financial success . \nindependence day was a runaway hit . \nand , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it\'s virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . \nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . \ngodzilla isn\'t completely without merit , although it is close . \nthere\'s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . \nfrankly , while the special effects are competent , they\'re not all that stunning . \nthere\'s nothing new here ; it\'s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . \nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . \ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . \nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . \n ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) \nworst of all , godzilla isn\'t even exciting . \nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn\'t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \nactually , part of the problem is that we\'re never sure who we\'re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \nin nick\'s words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . "" \nas luck would have it , nick\'s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . \nalong with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . \nthen , just when the military has rejected nick\'s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . \ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . \nunfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it\'s becoming boring . \nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . \nhe could climb the empire state building . \nat ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . \ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . \nthere\'s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick\'s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . \nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : "" ebert , "" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and "" gene "" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . \nebert\'s re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , "" thumbs up for new york . "" \nthe siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it\'s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . \nand , although the "" characters "" don\'t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . \ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . \nthis is largely because emmerich doesn\'t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . \nthat\'s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren\'t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren\'t a-list names . \nthen again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . \nmaria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . \nultimately , it doesn\'t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . \ntristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . \nit may also be word-of-mouth-proof . \nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . \nso , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it\'s like spitting into the wind . \nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . \nit\'s probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they\'ve been had . \n'",0
"b'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n "" shine "" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty "" life "" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and "" love and other catastrophes "" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \ni can\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \n "" shine "" was one bookend . \nstand by for the other one : "" dead heart "" . \n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \nbryan | brown . \nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man\'s justice "" to the aboriginals . \nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback "" . \nan eye for an eye . \nrevenge . \nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\'s thigh . \nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \nhe admits that he has to \'bend the rules\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback "" . \n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \nshe appears to not know this . \ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\'s payback time . \nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \neveryone is affected in the fall out . \nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \nsuffice to say it\'s a rewarding experience . \nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \'invaders\' : "" jedda "" , "" the chant of jimmie blacksmith "" and "" the last wave "" . \nin a year when the race \'debate\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as "" dead heart "" . \nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \nhe is asked to say if he is a "" black fella or white fella "" . \n'",1
"b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but "" good will hunting "" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \nwhat makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\'s life . \nthe script\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \nwill\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious "" right "" and "" wrong "" side and beating them over the head with it . \nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , "" good will hunting "" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \n "" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \nwill\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \'f\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\'s character . \nadd all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\'t given this film four stars . \nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \nstill , "" good will hunting "" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \'97 films . \n'",1
"b'the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i\'m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it\'s worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black\'s previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there\'s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn\'t take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn\'t need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin\'s first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n'",1

"b""earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . \na real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . \nnow , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . \nthere's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . \nthe plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . \nned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . \nenter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . \nthe two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . \nian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . \njackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . \nthe two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . \nevery viewer is sure to like both of them . \nthere are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . \nthis appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . \noverall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . \nthe ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . \nthe kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . \nin a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . \nit's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . \nthere's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . \nindeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . \n""",1
"b'capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson\'s short story , which is nowhere in sight . \ngibson\'s script only adds insult to injury . \njohnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie . \ni say "" awesomely "" because it\'s one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged . \nkeanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an "" information courier "" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head . \nhe is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal . \none of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it\'s only followed up on in a token fashion . \nfor his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers . \nwhat\'s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there\'s no room in this movie for any of that . \nthe yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly . \n ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . \nbut that\'s another essay . ) \nanyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . \nwhy newark ? \nmaybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that\'s why . \nthere , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . \nthe script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . \nit turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny\'s head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn\'t kill him . \nhandled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity . \nthe details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind . \neverything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they\'re punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace . \nsnore . \nthe only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un-technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like . \na hacker of johnny\'s caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that\'s not cinematic . \nwhatever . \nwhat went wrong with this movie ? \ngibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn\'t work in a movie . \nhis ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn\'t advance , it convulses . \nfrom the script on out , it was probably all downhill . \nrenting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there\'s no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ? \n'",0
"b'over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind\'s nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it\'s 14 years after toho\'s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich\'s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos\'s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe\'d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey\'s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation\'s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn\'t . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it\'s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit\'s fraught with lines so corny , they don\'t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl . "" \ni suppose when you\'ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick\'s , azaria\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\'ve seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can\'t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don\'t care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here\'s a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere\'s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm\'s way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit\'s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn\'t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn\'t work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n'",0
"b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it\'s just about time . \nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \n "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \ni\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \nin many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie\'s other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others . \nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \nthey\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \nat the time , i didn\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \nafter having seen more films like it , it\'s kind of grown on me . ) \n "" drunken master "" \'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \nafter embarrassing his instructor\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \nthen , when he\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \nit\'s been said before , but i\'ll say it again--these fights don\'t just _happen_ , they\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\'s really something to see . . . and \nit\'s often as funny as anything , too . \nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \nthere\'s very little that\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \nbut they\'re still hilarious as ever . \nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \nthe really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \ni\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \nit apparently helps if you\'re drunk while you\'re doing it . \ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\'s going on . \ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\'s \nnot just martial arts , it\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , "" whoa . . . "" \non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n "" gone with the wind "" , this isn\'t . \nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \nit\'s much more "" real "" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \nyou might very well like it . \nanother interesting thing about "" drunken master "" has to do with its video availability in the us . \n "" drunken master "" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \nthankfully , "" drunken master "" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \nif you like "" drunken master "" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \ni particularly recommend "" spiritual kung fu "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , the "" fearless hyena "" movies , and "" snake & crane arts of shaolin "" . \nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , "" drunken master ii "" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\'ve been told to suggest the "" once upon a time in china "" series starring jet li ( though i haven\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \nif you choose to watch "" drunken master "" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\'s out there . \nall in all , i give this film an . \n'",1
"b'if you\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \nif you\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\'s not likely that you\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \nbranagh proves once again that he\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \nthe problem is that he\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \n-- he hates his work , and he can\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\'s pretty hard to care about him . \nin addition , isn\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\'t just like him ? \ni know he is , but he didn\'t do it in celebrity . \nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\'re not likable people . \nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\'s new novel , has any life . \nthe men in the picture don\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \nwhat\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its "" themes "" are . \nallen seems to think that he\'s making an insightful movie about the way "" normal "" people look at celebrities . \nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a "" normal "" guy -- he\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , "" it\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! "" ) . \ncelebrity is arguably allen\'s biggest misfire to date . \nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \ni , for one , don\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \n'",0
"b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \nlast year\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \nwhatever uniqueness the original might\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \nunfortunately , things aren\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \nit\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \nthere\'s not much that\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \nand , whereas the killer\'s identity might\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "" the killer . "" \nthey\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \nand so , in the end , it\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \ngod help us . \n'",0

"b'tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . \nhowever , they won\'t find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . \njoe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . \nhis girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she\'s a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . \nsahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe\'s best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . \nhowever , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he\'s always pursued : a real blonde . \nthere are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough . \nthe best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara\'s perfume ads : "" depression - it\'s not just a state of mind "" . \nbut to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . \nand , unfortunately , the film\'s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . \ntake for example the film\'s framing device of an old lady and her dog . \nthe story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . \nmatthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they\'re stuck in the most boring plotlines . \nmodine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . \nkeener\'s character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense . \nthe movie\'s running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it . \nthere\'s just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama . \n'",0
"b""titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . \nthe film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . \nwe all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . \nbut sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) \nthe film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . \nthey find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . \nthe woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . \nthe explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . \nin the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . \nalso boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . \nshe nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . \noh yeah , and the ship sinks . \nand that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . \nthe story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . \nthe story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . \nwithout good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . \nfirstly , there's cameron's direction . \nthere are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . \nbut the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . \nthere is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . \nit's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . \nthanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . \nto support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . \ndicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . \nhis performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . \nwinslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . \nzane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . \nthe audience really does come to hate him . \nhe may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . \nalso worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . \nfinally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects . \ncameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . \nthe sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . \nthe humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . \nyou can tell that they have been animated on a computer . \nof course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . \ntitanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . \ntitanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . \nagain , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . \ntitanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . \nenjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . \na superb film , but sadly not perfect . \noverall rating= ( \n""",1

they\'ve been in storage for years waiting for woody . \nif woody doesn\'t go with them , they\'ll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . \ntrying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . \nwhile woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al\'s toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn\'t know he\'s a toy . \nthe new buzz generates the movie\'s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg\'s fortress "" ( i . e . , al\'s apartment building ) . \nthe original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . \nwhile most kids\' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn\'t special , that he was just like everyone else . \nbuzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . \nin other words , it\'s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . \nmost of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we\'re not space rangers and we\'re never going to be . \n "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . \nwoody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . \nthis is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . \nthe theme is introduced early in the movie when woody\'s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . \non the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who\'s dusty , broken , and forgotten . \nthe other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody\'s ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . \nafter he\'s stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . \nof course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it\'s also very funny . \nmost of the laughs come from the toys\' assault on al\'s toy barn and on the apartment building . \nthe brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i\'d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \nhe doesn\'t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \nthe animation is even better than in the first . \nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar\'s \'toy story 2\' "" -- this is pixar\'s coming out party . \nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \non the downside , "" toy story 2 "" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \noverall , though , i had a great time and found "" story 2 "" to be a worthy successor to the first "" toy story .

"b'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \nfincher\'s the game is no exception to this . \nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \nfincher hasn\'t made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \nso it is about time he made another film . \nand what a ride it is . \nthe game isn\'t quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better . \noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \nunfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \nthe game is told completely from its main character\'s point of view . \nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \n "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises . \nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \n "" each game is suited to each person\'s emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold . \none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \nwhat he doesn\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\' way . \nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \nthe detail involved in fincher\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \nwith "" seven , "" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \ncompared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical . \nbecause of this film\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \nso don\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\'t want you to . \nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \nif taken as it is , the game\'s ending makes complete sense . \nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \nwe don\'t really care if douglas\' character lives or not because it isn\'t believable . \nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his "" falling down "" persona ) . \nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\' brother . \ndeborah kara unger ( from "" crash "" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\' predicament . \nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from "" shine "" ) as the book editor . \nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\' did . \nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\'s best films . \n'",1
"b'we all know the fate of "" child\'s play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . \nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it\'s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . \nalas , the original "" child\'s play "" actually isn\'t that bad . \neven seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn\'t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don\'t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn\'t a bad movie . \nit\'s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don\'t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone . \nthe premise of "" child\'s play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid\'s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid\'s doll i\'ve ever seen . \nthe next day , a bum who\'s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . \nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . \nlike the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . \nand soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn\'t just a kiddie doll one by one . \nthe idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . \nit plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they\'re crazy . \nit plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . \neven if there\'s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , \nthere\'s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . \nthe ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . \nif there\'s one horrible thing about many horror films , it\'s that the protagonists are morons who you can\'t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child\'s play "" steers away from that . \nand most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! \nthat doll\'s moving on its own ! ) , but because he\'s a generally scary character . \nif there\'s anything really wrong with "" child\'s play , "" it\'s that it\'s too trite and has too less self esteem . \nat almost 90 minutes , "" child\'s play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . \nit throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren\'t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . \nif the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which \nisn\'t necessarily a bad thing . \nas such , "" child\'s play "" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film . \n'",1
"b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\'re portraying , it\'s fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film . \nit\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\'ve seen all year , and that\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \n "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \n "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain\'t evil . \nit\'s just sad . "" \nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \n "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" \nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\'t leave them alone . \nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\'t regret it . \nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \nthus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \n "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \nit\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i\'ll bet she\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \nshe was strictly an actress . \nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \nemotion . \nsadness . \nstrength . \nwatching the strong sethe , who\'s so afraid of the past that she\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \nshe makes it real . \nthat\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \nin fact , i\'d wager to say that the fact that it\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \nwhile oprah\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \nit doesn\'t necessarily move as though they\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\'s the point . \nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \njonathan demme\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \nthere\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \nact like a baby . \nthrow things . \nstumble around . \nchew food with your mouth open . \ni do think there\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\'s loss of reality towards the end . \nit\'s not that newton isn\'t great : she\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \nit\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , "" beloved "" has still not done well . \ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula , "" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \nalthough i respect "" beloved , "" i can\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \n'",1
"b'despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995\'s original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . \nso , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel\'s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . \nit would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . \nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i\'m not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . \nthe alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs\'s short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . \nthis alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film\'s sil , but it\'s close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . \nmeanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . \nit doesn\'t take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . \nit\'s up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick\'s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . \n "" this isn\'t the x-files , goddammit ! "" \nexclaims one character in the early going . \nin terms of quality , he\'s absolutely right , but he\'s also wrong . \nthe new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick\'s pupils to dilate once he\'s infected . \nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files\'s "" black cancer "" to me . \nbut that\'s not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . \nspecies was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original\'s director , roger donaldson , did . \nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve\'s alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . \na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? \naliens sans flamethrowers . \nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel\'s effects crew at steve johnson\'s xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . \nafter the effects , the original\'s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . \nhowever , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . \nat one point she\'s called on to play alien "" empath "" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she\'s holed up in a glass cell . \nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . \nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . \none problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . \nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . \nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as "" i\'m gonna get african on someone\'s ass "" and not appear ridiculous ? \nbut species ii\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\'s , for a start . \nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \n'",0

"b""my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . \nwe are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . \nsince other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . \ni can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . \nhe was not amused . \ni on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . \nperhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . \ni on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . \nthe movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . \nthis movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . \nthe producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . \nan autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . \nin a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . \nthe opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . \nthe writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' . \nas the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . \neve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . \nin a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet .

"b""just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n""",1
"b'there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description . \nthe movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . \npresumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . \nmovies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . \n "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . \nunfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . \nunfortunately , there are no laughs . \nthe movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn\'t benefit from chan\'s incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . \ninstead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year\'s "" boogie nights . "" \nhowever , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . \nwahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed ) . \nthe movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can\'t stand for anyone not to like him . "" \nthe fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . \nhis constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . \nmelvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . \none day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . \nhowever , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris\' goddaughter . \nso , when paris finds out she\'s been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . \nnot knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . \nof course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . \nalong the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by "" jurassic park , "" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she\'s barely pushing fifteen ) . \nwhat the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . \nnot to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "" king kong lives , "" which is two weeks overdue . \nthis mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( "" face/off "" ) , who also served as executive producer . \nwoo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . \nwong , who directed such films as "" rock\'n\'roll cop "" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . \nmaybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they\'re not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . \nmany of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . \nin addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey\'s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . \nwhat he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is "" it\'s all love "" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco\'s stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . \nthe irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . \n'",0

"b""errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr . \ndeath . \nthis film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us . \ndon't let the film's cheesy dissuade you . \nfollowing this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind . \nmorris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . \nvirtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . \nafter a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened . \nmorris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . \nzundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . \nleuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . \npart of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . \nthis was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . \ncombine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary . \nwhile this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . \naside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience . \n""",1
"b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \nthat makes it a film without much center . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\'s travels . \nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \nwithout it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series . \ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\'s best if not his best . \nwhen the film\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\'s new version is even less faithful . \nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \nand the language they talk is earth- english . \napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn\'t like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\'s visualization is really an improvement . \nthese visuals work nicely . \nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \napes spring incredible distances . \nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \nbut he delivers them very well . \nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\'s performance in spartacus . \nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \ndanny elfman\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",0
"b'jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \nmaybe it\'s a classic case of displacement : it\'s easier to see jarvis\' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh\'s films . \nbut it\'s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don\'t make for a guarantee of \'authenticity\' , let alone a good film . \nit\'s the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek \'authenticity\' and honesty in everyday lives . \nfollowing her adopted mother\'s funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \ncynthia\'s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife\'s animosity towards her . \nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn\'t it ? \nthat way nobody gets hurt . "" . \nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it\'s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \nhence , cynthia\'s difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "" been with a black man "" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \nat the party , cynthia\'s pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he\'s "" just dropping by "" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \nmaurice\'s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look "" as bad as possible "" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , "" i\'ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs "" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , "" if you\'ve got it , flaunt it , is what i say . "" \nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \nbut she\'s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she\'s so needy of love , perhaps . \nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia\'s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \nthe film\'s climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \nhowever , it\'s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character\'s lives . \nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",1

\nright ! \nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that\'s it . \nmaybe some stunts . \nfor all this , i can\'t even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \ngeorge is in between them . \nhe\'s not quintessential , he\'s not horrible , he\'s good . \nbut i\'m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they\'ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we\'ll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? \narnold isn\'t very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . \nwhen he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . \nwow . \nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . \nit\'s like she\'s almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points . \nshe\'s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . \nas for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he\'s best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes . "" \nalicia - i love the girl but she\'s not particularly good in this film . \nshe can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in "" clueless , "" but her lines kinda sound weird . \nand it isn\'t the mushy-mouth this time . \nbut in all fairness , she has virtually no part . \njoel gets around to her occasionally and when she\'s on , she does stupid stuff . . . although \ni know i\'m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . \nand poor elle . \npoor , poor elle . \ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw "" sirens "" ) . \nbut she has no part ! ! ! \nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . \nthere are no "" couch "" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . \nnow listen to me on this one - in every "" batman "" flick , there\'s a couch scene . \nin the original , it was with vicki . \nin "" returns , "" it was a good make-out scene with selena . \nand in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . \nthis one , it\'s nothing . \nand batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she\'s suddenly "" part of the family .

"" \ni laughed at all these . \nthe film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or \ndid it just feel like that ? \nthe film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . \npeople are fed up with stupid films . \nthat\'s why the word of mouth killed "" the lost world ! "" \nthat\'s why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . \nthat\'s why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . \nthat\'s why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo\'s "" face/off "" and barry sonnenfeld\'s "" men in black , "" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . \ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . \ni like some of his films ( "" flatliners , "" "" a time to kill "" ) but a lot of them suck . \nhe\'s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that\'s what makes him great . \nbut his costuming for woody allen\'s "" sleeper "" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . \ni love the "" batman "" series . \nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one . \nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . \nhopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . \nand maybe they\'ll get smart and bring back catwoman . \nand michael keaton . \nbut we can only hope . \n'",0
"b'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\'s so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\'t stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\'re not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\'t have driven the rest of it . \n'",0
"b' "" last night "" could have an "" aka "" tagged on the end of it that says , "" it\'s the end of the world , and we feel fine "" . \n "" last night "" is about just that . \nthe last night of planet earth\'s existence . \nthe world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . \nhow scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . \nnor is the event itself . \nthroughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . \nin doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . \nhe\'s attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . \nthe film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . \nmckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . \nthe film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . \nthere\'s mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . \nher husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . \nfinally , there\'s mckellar\'s friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . \nmckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i\'ve seen in a film in months . \nthese people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . \nwe can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . \nrennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . \nhe exudes such charm and likeablity , it\'s not surprising that we\'re rooting for him to get what he wants . \nbut for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . \ni knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . \nhis insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . \nhe doesn\'t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone\'s going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . \nhe realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . \nmckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . \nmy only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . \ni really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . \ni appreciate the fact that mckellar didn\'t want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . \nhowever , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth\'s destruction is , he\'s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . \nanother problem is we never see anybody panicking . \ni would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . \ninstead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it\'s new year\'s eve . \ni just didn\'t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . \nno one had the urge to "" rage against the dying of the light "" . \ndespite these small problems , "" last night "" is one of the best movies of the year . \nas opposed to the moronic "" armageddon "" , "" last night "" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . \nand bruce willis never shows up to save the day . \n'",1
"b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "" \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her "" kiss of death , "" jax does his "" earthquake , "" liu kang does his "" animality , "" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their "" animalities . "" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n'",0
"b""even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . \nthe similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . \nit would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . \nanother more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . \nthis is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . \nwhat helps final destination is its unique premise . \nunlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . \nthis being already has predestined when and how you will die . \naccording to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . \nwhat is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . \nthe only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? \nthis dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . \nalex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . \nalex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . \nshortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . \nhowever , death isn't through with them yet . \nit gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . \nthe plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . \nsome scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . \ncreativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . \nsure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . \nalso director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . \nhe knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . \nthe myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . \nand from this , i had a great time watching the movie . \n""",1

"b'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \nit\'s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \ni mean , come on . \nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \nhell no . \nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \ni\'ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \nlet me backtrack a minute . \nwhen i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don\'t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \nthis is a thinking man\'s slasher flick . \nthe "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock\'s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter\'s ) . \nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \nreally a good sign . \nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a "" nosferatu "" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter\'s hometown via boat . \nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker\'s novel . \njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment\'s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau\'s original masterpiece . \nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang\'s metropolis . \nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \nbut that\'s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more "" modern "" version better . \neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \nif you\'re like me , just do what i\'ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \n'",1
"b""if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . \nwhile luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . \nthe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . \nas tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes . \nhowever , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . \ntaymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . \nshe is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . \nshe also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . \nthe clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right . \nlennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . \na great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . \n_titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice . \n""",1
"b'the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" . \nso i didn\'t expect too much from this . \nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \nactually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . \nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \nis that exciting or what ? \nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\'t have to be bad . \nit\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \'\' by shirley jackson . \na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \n "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \nand with a $70 mill . \nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \nbut why give him a more serious material ? \nin the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\'s career as a director . \nyet it wouldn\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \nbut this is where the good things end . \nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \nit\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\'t engage . \nat first you do not know what\'s going on . \nis this part of the experiment ? \nare these hallucinations ? \nprojections of the subconscience ? \nparanoia ? \nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \nthe house is actually possessed . \nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\'s what i got ? \ni believe hichock once said that "" it\'s better to wait for a climax , than to see one "" . \nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \nthey are impossible to take seriously . \nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\'s "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless . \n "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \n "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" . \n'",0
"b'plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . \nbut this new guy is not like all the others , he\'s got ambition , he\'s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . \nviolence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . \ncritique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . \nhere\'s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . \nokay , so it\'s not entirely new , but it\'s definitely original when all put together as done here . \nthe thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . \nit\'s 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! \nyes , it\'s all about the suits , fellas . . . the \nitalian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that\'s ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . \nhere are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . \nbut that\'s not the basis of this movie . \nthe basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . \nyou know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? \nwell , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that \nis , their boss . \nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . \nbut this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . \nof course , director paul mcguigan isn\'t trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn\'t over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . \nnope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . \nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he\'s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! \n ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) \nin fact , the last time that i\'ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers\' miller\'s crossing . \nscary shite . \nbut there\'s an ever better scene than that in this film . \nthis one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man\'s point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that\'s right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) . \nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . \nbut the flick\'s not perfect . \nin fact , i didn\'t mind malcolm mcdowell\'s voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . \nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( "" . . . so \ni opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . .

"b'what a contrast ! \nin the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . \ni\'m not sure you could get two more different movies . \nwhile the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . \nthis is one interesting movie . \nit\'s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of \'98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . \nthere\'s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . \nhurlyburly doens\'t contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . \nhis big question is : does it all pertain to him ? \nand if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \n "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . \ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what\'s it all about ? \nthis is not a movie for answers . \ndonna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they\'re not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . \nthat\'s what makes this movie stay on your mind . \nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . \neven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . \nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly . \ni haven\'t seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can\'t remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . \neddie isn\'t a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . \ni don\'t want to be his friend but i\'d like to help him . \nchazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . \ni\'d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . \neveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . \nit\'s a nasty world ; it\'s a sexist world . \nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man\'s world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . \ni find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . \nfirst , it\'s depressing that such a world exists . \na large part of hurlyburly\'s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . \nsure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . \nsecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men\'s world . \nwhere are the stories about women\'s world ? \nnot the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . \nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . \nit\'s very talkative , intelligent and static . \nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they\'re quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . \nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . \nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . \nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . \nit also means that you have to pay attention . \n'",0
"b'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \nthat\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\'s tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn\'t too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to \'evil . \' "" \nthen there\'s the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\'t mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who\'s the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it\'s the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that\'s the best part of the movie , i can\'t in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards . \n'",0
"b'apocalypse now , based on the novel "" hearts of darkness "" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . \na long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . \nin many ways , this debate could go either way . \napocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . \nin addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years . \napocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia . \ncaptain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with "" extreme prejudice "" because he has been deemed a murderer . \nwillard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation . \naccusing someone of murder in this situation is like "" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 "" , as he puts it . \nit doesn\'t make too much sense . \nescorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat . \nthe men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) . \nwillard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big . \nthe men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations . \nbut no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore . \nkilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf . \nsurf . \nthis is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson . \nduvall\'s portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes . \neventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz\'s frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers . \none of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard . \nbut willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony . \nkurtz is actually well aware of willard\'s mission , and refers to him as "" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill "" . \nyet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does . \napocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war . \na movie that will hypnotize you with it\'s brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war . \ndefinitely on the "" do not miss "" list . \nbe prepared for a very memorable film . \n'",1
"b'i\'m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i\'m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . \nseriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . \nthe first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . \nan example : "" that [car crash] must\'ve been awful . . . for \neveryone involved .

"b""this is the movie not the perfume . \na slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . \nit is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . \nset in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy . \nhis real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes . \nupon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed . \ninspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers . \nbut the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found . \ngrieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop . \nsixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife . \nwhen he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife . \nher name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying . \nhe falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her . \nsandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him . \nthe surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . \nit plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way . \n""",1
"b""note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nmilos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . \nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \nconsidering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . \nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \nthe film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \nthere's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . \nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \nit's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \n""",1
"b'there\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \nthe "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\'s daughter . \nthe project they\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \nshe\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\'s weaknesses . \nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \nthere are probably too many characters . \nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\'s life , marianna\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\'s husband . \nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \nthe stories are all well-told , but it\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \nthere isn\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\'t "" do much "" for me . \non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \nfinn\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\'s experiences . \nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \nif there\'s a disappointment here , it\'s that the script doesn\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \n'",1

"" \nand in some ways it is . \nboth follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . \nbut while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter\'s friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . \nthe friends of peter\'s were all in the same theatre group back in \'82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . \nafter peter\'s ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . \nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . \nof course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . \nandrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who\'s unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . \nmaggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . \nroger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . \nand sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who\'s married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . \nas for peter , things seem okay . . . \nthe film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i\'ve done lots of theatre myself ) . \nand there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . \nthe final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . \nmaybe it\'s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . \nthat\'s really what makes "" peter\'s friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone\'s in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . \nit\'s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . \nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . \nthere are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i\'d put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we\'re talking about . \noh well . \nbut anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . \nbranagh\'s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he\'s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . \nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , "" no , but we have hollywood "" - punishment like that ) . \nthe actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter\'s mansion . \na little note should be made about hugh laurie\'s performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i\'ve never seen him actually act this dramatically . \n "" peter\'s friends "" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don\'t know what kind i\'ll have ( like most people , i don\'t look forward to my high school reunion ) . \nbecause of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that . \n'",1
"b'the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies\'s sophomore feature , "" snatch . "" \n "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" intro\'d helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer\'s attention from beginning to end . \nhis protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive . \nwith "" snatch , "" the director doesn\'t remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process . \n>from the very beginning , "" snatch "" tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) . \nen route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi\'s partner and cousin , doug "" the head "" ( mike reid ) . \nfrankie\'s addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris "" the blade "" ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster . \nthe bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry . \nmeanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm . \nwhen their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o\'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight . \nmickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy\'s deal . \nbrick top , impressed by mickey\'s performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse . \nwhen avi doesn\'t get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , "" bullet tooth "" tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond . \nthings spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy . \nguy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters\' mouths like machine gun fire . \nthe helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example . \nthe assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives "" snatch "" an earthy feel in its depiction of london\'s criminal underworld . \nthe cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting . \nalan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top . \nwhen he refuses sugar in his tea because "" i\'m sweet enough , "" it makes you shiver , even as you laugh . \nhis is one of the best gangster characters i\'ve seen in years . \nthe other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie\'s popularity may hang upon , at least initially . \npitt , as mickey o\'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe . \nthis gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) . \nwhen brick top threaten the safety of mickey\'s family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped . \npitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer . \nthe production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life . \nthere is a patent feel to the look of "" snatch "" and "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" that reeks of "" signature "" for ritchie , but i\'m not sure how this will translate in his future works . \nthere is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions . \nnonetheless , "" snatch "" is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot . \ni give it a b+ . \n'",1
"b'i\'m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . \nlet\'s say you\'ve just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . \nyour friends have left to go get help , and you\'re waiting to see if the victim wakes up . \na tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what\'s going on . \nhe then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . \ndo you : \na ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , \nb ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? \nif you answered "" a "" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" and will likely hate this movie . \nhowever , if you answered "" b "" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! \n "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" is being called a sequel , but it\'s really more of a remake of the original . \nthere\'s a few changes here and there , but it\'s essentially the same ( even the infamous "" meathook "" scene has been re-created . ) \nthe story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . \nneedless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . \nmuch carnage ensues . \nto call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . \nin addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . \nit just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . \nno explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . \nthe dialogue is even more atrocious . \nzellwegger , who is kidnapped by "" the family "" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . \nwhen you\'re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . \nspeaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . \napparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . \nthe director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn\'t * get caught in the window . \nthis was one of many glaring inconsistencies . \nthere are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . \nthe only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . \nhe plays a member of "" the family "" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can\'t help but be amazed by his performance . \nhe obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . \nhe makes jack nicholson\'s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in "" the shining "" look restrained in comparison . \nfor a horror movie , "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" contains surprisingly little gore . \nin fact , in contains none . \nthere\'s a little blood here and there , but that\'s as far as it goes . \nwhich leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . \neverything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . \nespecially leatherface . \nonce frightening and nightmare inducing , he\'s now as terrifying as dame edna . \ndo yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . \ncheck out the far superior original instead . \n'",0
"b""i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . \nwith teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . \nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . \nthe components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . \nbut where are the thrills ? \nthe laughs ? \nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . \nand what a shame that is . \ni loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . \nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . \nteaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . \nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . \ni still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . \nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . \nmrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . \nthe principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . \ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . \nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \nthe plot is a big problem here . \nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \nin the morning . . . \nhow convenient ! \nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \na moment like that never arises . \nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \n""",0
"b' "" well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it\'s mission : impossible . \ndifficult should be a walk in the park for you . "" \n---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series\' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . \na russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . \na rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . \nposing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . \nthe real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . \nethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose\'s . \nreluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . \nethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . \nalthough the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn\'t much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . \nthat problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . \nthe end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . \nunfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah\'s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . \nethan\'s conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . \njohn woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups . \nthe surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . \nthankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah\'s deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed . \nrobert towne\'s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . \nafter that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo\'s previous high-octane films . \nthe final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) . \nas far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . \nanyone looking for hardcore action won\'t be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) . \neven if you weren\'t a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out . \n[pg-13] \n'",1

"b""getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . \nthe film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . \nbut thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . \ngetting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . \ngavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . \nmuch to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old . \ngetting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . \ngetting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . \ngavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . \nwe observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . \nbirdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . \nthe charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . \ndespite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . \nfor a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . \ngavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . \nafter minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . \nhelena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . \ngavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . \npeter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . \nthe scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . \ngavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . \nher life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . \ngavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . \ngetting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . \nfirst , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . \nsecond , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . \noverall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . \ndirector kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery . \n""",1
"b'it was easy to fear the worst . \nbegin with a classic 1960\'s television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . \nscript , you ask ? \nwho needs one , kid . . . \nwe\'ve got ourselves a formula . \nthat was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . \nthen , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . \ndidn\'t . \nthe fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . \nunder the direction of andrew davis ( 1992\'s under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . \nexpect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . \nthe premise is a simple one . \ndr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . \nafter an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . \nhis one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . \nwhere the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . \nin a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . \nin an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . \non his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn\'t know is kimble to zip up his pants . \nit\'s a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble\'s situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . \nlater , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he\'d be recognized from behind . \nit\'s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble\'s tells gerard that he\'s too smart to be caught , he may just be right . \ncredit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . \nthe bus crash which allows kimble\'s escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . \nthe action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . \nspecial kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . \nand what a pair of performances those leads are . \ntommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . \nfor the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . \nit would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . \ninstead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who\'s just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble\'s comment , "" i didn\'t kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don\'t care , "" we know exactly what he means . \nit\'s not his job to determine guilt or innocence . \nit\'s his job to bring in a fugitive . \nthis is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . \nthe only unfortunate thing about jones\' stunning turn is that it\'s likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that\'s a shame . \nfor his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . \nhowever , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . \nthe fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . \nthis summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . \nhowever , it\'s time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . \nthe chase is on . \nmy advice is to catch it . \n'",1

"b""it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens . \nhowever , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . \nin his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . \nthe story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . \npeter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . \nevery day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in \nother words , every day is the worst day in his entire life . \nhe's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities . \nhe's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself . \neverything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . \nbut all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . \nhe realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . \nhe begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . \npeter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , \nnot that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude . \nbut , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . \nas bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . \nalthough it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . \neach mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . \nyet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . \nron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . \nhis character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity . \nhe is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . \nanyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . \nin fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . \nthe animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity . \nmost of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . \none employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . \nhowever , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . \nit's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . \nthe film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny . \n""",1
"b'ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . \nyes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual "" identities , "" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "" girl power . "" \nbut not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn\'t enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . \nthe film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- "" scary "" ( melanie brown ) , "" baby "" ( emma bunton ) , "" sporty "" ( melanie chisolm ) , "" ginger "" ( geri halliwell ) , and "" posh "" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad "" too much "" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . \na few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london\'s royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls\' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant "" mate "" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o\'brien ) . \ncapped off by a live rendition of the girls\' bouncy hit "" say you\'ll be there , "" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? \nwrong . it\'s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . \ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the "" wacky "" goings-on . \nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . \nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a "" dance bootcamp "" scene , the girls sing the lyric "" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra "" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . \nsome gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore\'s recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . \nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . \nha ha . \nas weak as the script is , i think there\'s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . \nthe point is not that they can\'t act ( and , for the record , they really _can\'t_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . \nposh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . \nbaby\'s persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls\' identities are a little harder to flesh out . \nthere really isn\'t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being "" ginger "" or "" scary "" ? \napparently , just their wardrobes . \nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices\' signature hit , "" wannabe .

"b'this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we\'ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn\'t used enough here ) , i\'m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . \nin this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . \nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . \nover money ( how original ) . \nwhile in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . \nnow she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . \nnow her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . \nskipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . \nbut she\'s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn\'t really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . \nas i\'d said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . \nhe was much more of a supporting character . \nwhich is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . \ni feel this film had alot going for it . \noriginality not being an issue . \nthe acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . \nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . \nthe action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . \ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run . \nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . \nkeep this in mind , if you\'re in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . \nd+ \n'",0

"b' "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \nthat\'s right . \nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising . "" \ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \nit\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\'t playing like he\'s autistic . \nunlike dustin hoffman\'s performance in "" rain man "" or leonardo dicaprio\'s in "" what\'s eating gilbert grape , "" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \nhowever , unlike "" rain man "" which used its character\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , "" mercury rising "" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \nhell , he doesn\'t even have to be shy . \nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\' arm . \nwillis\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \nof course , we know that isn\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\'s character is far too accommodating . \nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here "" mercury rising "" doesn\'t rise to the challenge . \nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including "" sea of love "" ( 1989 ) and "" malice "" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\'s more suspenseful that way . \ntaken as a whole , "" mercury rising "" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \n'",0

"b'starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he\'s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \ni\'ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i\'ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there\'s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \nand then answers it in the form of bello\'s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn\'t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it\'s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he\'s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \nso much for the moral of that story . \ntemporary midnight is more like it . \n-bill chambers ; september , 1998 \n'",0
"b'the most interesting part of "" can\'t hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to . \nthat is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film\'s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored . \nthe film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost \ntoo nicely . \nfor some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what\'s going on with them watching this film . \nwe sit there wondering why we\'ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place . \ni would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this . \nafter all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . \neveryone\'s here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers . \nexcept for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) . \nunfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film . \nthe film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . \nhowever , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes . \nwe follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them . \nand if we did , we certainly don\'t want to revisit that state of being . \nhere\'s a quick low-down : it\'s graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the "" american grafitti "" or , to a lesser extent , the "" dazed and confused "" cliche . \nthe formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party . \n "" can\'t hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i\'m-whining-because-i-can\'t-get-a-girl-i-want brand . \nwe follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of "" that thing you do ! "" ) , the alienated writer , who\'s been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . \nnow that she\'s broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he\'s written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he\'ll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even \nthough he\'s leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . \nsince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn\'t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it\'s a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who\'s humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don\'t ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . \nugh . \nthe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused , "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably "" sixteen candles . "" \nthe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . \nthis film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and \nthen says that it\'s all okay . \nwe can\'t take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? \nbut i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it\'s like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . \ngenerally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . \ni actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . \nand , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . \nhowever , the character of denise really doesn\'t work with the film , when really thought about . \nshe\'s far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . \nshe\'s not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she\'s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . \nshe may ruin the film more , but at least when she\'s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves "" well , at least we\'ll be entertained . "" \na couple other things that just don\'t work : mike\'s character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn\'t work at all : jenna eflman\'s uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn\'t work , but nice try . \nbasically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i\'m giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we\'d do . \nwe don\'t feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren\'t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . \nthe acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it\'s portraying ? \nthe answer for this film is no . \nnice try , though . \n'",0

"b""i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \nbut i don't care . \nnot even a little . \nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \n3 ) the movie is so funny . \nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \ni haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \noh sure , it's trite . \nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . \nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \nhe can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \nas far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \nand the movie is just so funny . \nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . \nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \nin addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \na lot . \n""",1

"b'when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment . \neven politicians ( ! ) \ntend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction . \nthese [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic\'s job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . \nthusly patch adams isn\'t a bad film because it\'s about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it\'s a bad film because it\'s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . \nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it\'s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . \nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . \n12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we\'re all living in a frank capra movie . \nmeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow . \npay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . \nit\'s as if director mimi leder didn\'t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn\'t "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . \nso the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn\'t quite sure if it\'s ready to buy into its own utopian blather . \npay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr\'s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson\'s earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . \nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? "" \nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \n ( maybe spike\'s flick wasn\'t so misguided after all ) . \nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \nit\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\'t get academy awards . \nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\'s thoughts : "" boy this outta floor em "" . \nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \nnever mind that the two couldn\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \nthey\'re so adorable . \nof course the blame can\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\'s a movie that treats earth\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : "" see my movie isn\'t as na ? ve as you might think "" she seems to be saying . \nno , it\'s just horribly confused . \n'",0

\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \nthe box for the film claims "" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \ncontains nudity and graphic violence "" . \nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \ni haven\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \n'",0

"b""synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \n""",1
"b""retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \na timeless epic it is not . \nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \nalmost too 90's , it seems . \nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \n""",0
"b""note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nto assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . \nit would be derisive . \nit would be glib . \nit would be dismissive . \nit would be entirely accurate . \nrarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . \nthe film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . \nthe film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . \ndespite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . \nconsequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . \nlouise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . \n ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) \nmeanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . \nserenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . \nit could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . \nit is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . \nnone of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . \ndirector alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . \nwhile tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . \nto his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . \ni caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . \nto be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . \nthe winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . \nthe film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . \n""",0
"b'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba\'s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment "" . \ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \'70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . \ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . \nfellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . \ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain\'t so . \nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro\'s repressiveness , i can\'t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can\'t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . \nas kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution\'s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . \nthe proper questions to put relate to castro\'s legitimacy . \ni bet the film takes castro\'s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba\'s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba\'s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . \nthat\'s why i just can\'t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . \nlet\'s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . \ni saw the film--twice . \ni was right ; castro remained intact . \nstrawberry negotiates the relationship between a young "" dialectic materialist , "" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . \nthe young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution\'s reason for being . \ngrateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . \ntherein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . \ncuba\'s government is castro . \ndiego\'s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . \nhe enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . \nhe does not do "" voluntary work "" for the revolution . \nhis small apartment is a sensual oasis . \nthe moniker "" bourgeois "" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . \nhowever , he is a "" revolucionario "" in his own way . \nthe supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david\'s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david\'s ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . \ngutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . \nheck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . \nhe really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . \nreal criticism is missing though . \nthis movie is political window dressing . \nluis aguilar leon\'s op . \ned . \npiece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . \naguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film\'s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . \nas art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept "" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . "" \nalthough terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . \n'",1
"b'whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \nsomewhere along the line , the "" star trek "" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \nsoran\'s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \ni don\'t think it is an insult to fans of "" star trek "" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a "" trek "" film . \nit\'s about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn\'t happen . \ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \nin the film\'s major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \nhe doesn\'t get a joke . \nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data\'s new emotions , but the point is that he\'s no longer the data we know . \nif the rest of the "" next generation "" cast fares any better , it\'s only because they\'re on the screen so little that they\'re simply window dressing . \nbut then again , this story isn\'t really about the new crew . \nit\'s about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he\'s having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \nstewart\'s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount\'s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it\'s a moment of high energy . \nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that\'s time this new crew doesn\'t have . \nit certainly doesn\'t help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \nit\'s also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the "" trek "" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations\' major flaws . \nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you\'d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn\'t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \nno , i think the audience might need them more . \nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \n'",0
"b' "" he\'s back , and it\'s about time . "" \nwas the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don\'t care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . \nthe motto was well chosen . \nthe series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . \nas good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . \nis it the acting ? \nhell , no ! \npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who\'ve played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . \nhe looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . \ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor\'s first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . \nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i\'ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . \nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts . \none time he had to say to mcgann\'s doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion . "" \nbut he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . . \ndress . . . \nfor the occasion . "" \nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who\'s also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . \nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . \ni dunno who thought of casting him , but if they\'re reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! \nhe rides on his sister\'s coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . \nis this problem the kisses to the past ? \nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they\'re good . \nis it the script or the movie as a whole ? \nthe script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . \nso what is it ? \nsimple : no plot . \nthe master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . \nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee\'s help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn\'t close it by then . \nvirtually no plot . \ni was told the movie would\'ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . \nthat shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would\'ve gotten a four star rating out of me . \n'",1
"b'the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l . a . confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \n "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol\' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn\'t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \noveracted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there\'s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \ndirected by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who\'s the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \nparticularly one . \nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \nnext thing , she cries rape . \nand the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues . \na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin\' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo\'s zany lawyer . \nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \nas ridiculous as it sounds , he\'s the most sane character in the movie . \nthe community is astonished . \nreporters flee to the scene . \nthere\'s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) . \nthere\'s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \nlike so many thrillers these days , including "" the usual suspects "" and "" the game , "" "" wild things "" eschews character for plot . \nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he\'s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany "" henry , "" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \ngeorge clinton\'s score is a delight to behold . \nbut it\'s the humans . \nthe characters are mere devices for the "" nasty "" twists . \nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don\'t feel real or we don\'t care for them . \nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \nthe people in "" wild things "" are not so much people as they are caricatures . \nthen there\'s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon\'s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \nironically , the wildest elements of "" wild things "" are not wild at all . \n'",0
"b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit\'s also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he\'s gay . "" \nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \nnaturally the questions pour from howard\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \nthe frenzy isn\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\'re up to bat . \nrudnick\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \nwhile in & out doesn\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \ndespite it\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \ncheck this one out . \nyou\'ll have a gay old time . \n'",1

"b'steven spielberg\'s "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \n "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie . \nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn\'t already know about it . \nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \nfor one thing , spielberg\'s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders\' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \nthe biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \n "" what kind of country is this , where laws \'almost\' work ? "" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \nspielberg\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\'s angry outburst in the court room . \nstill , there isn\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \nthis summer\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \n "" amistad "" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : "" amistad "" is three four star films edited into one . \nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \nhowever , i can\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \n'",1

"b'how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ? \nin spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it . \nif that was their goal , they did a fantastic job . \nso is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn\'t really meant to be much better than this ? \nhonestly , i\'d rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ? \ntruth be known , i don\'t really think i can answer this question . \nto understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls . \nunless you\'re very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them . \nthey\'re a group of five busty british babes who\'ve had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions . \nthey\'re primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice\'s ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra . \nall five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names . \nthere is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names . \nthe spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame . \nit\'s quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves . \nthey don\'t take themselves too seriously , and that\'s probably the best thing about them . \nit\'s also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing . \nthey\'re not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) . \nwhat makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won\'t get enough of their music , while the rest of us don\'t get enough of a movie . \nthe real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes . \nmost of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud ! \nif you\'re a big fan of the group , you probably won\'t get enough of what you want , and if you\'re not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments . \nfor the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline . \nother key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls\' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role . \nall provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film wasn\'t meant to be acted seriously . \neven meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it . \nwhile this film is continuously compared to the beatles\' a hard day\'s night , i think that is an unjust comparison . \nit is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i don\'t think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so . \ni think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious . \ni don\'t think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step . \nand what could\'ve been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ? \nprobably nothing , and so it is . \nspiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn\'t even give a good review . \nit\'s bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended . \nit gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment . \nperhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick . \nif that\'s the case , the movie\'s gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick ! \nyou might be saying , "" a spice girls movie ? \ncome on !

"b'jacques tati\'s 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot\'s vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\'s vacation . \nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\'t watch where they\'re going . \nin "" les vacances de m . hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \ntati doesn\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\'s expectations , and "" les vacances de m . hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he\'s not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does . \nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\'s lights coming on one by one . \nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \n "" les vacances de m . hulot "" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \nnote : "" les vacances de m . hulot "" was not rated by the mpaa . \nit would at most receive a pg rating . \n'",1
"b'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\'s palme d\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \nin between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\' bare feet . \nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \nand there aren\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \nthere\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\'s about it . \njackie brown\'s lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \nthis isn\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\'s courage under fire . \nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\'s unconventional . \nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \'70s icon . \nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\'s career , tarantino uses a \'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \nshe\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\'s "" banyon "" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \njackie passes ordell\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\'s foot fetish . \nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \nit\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \n'",1

"b' "" the endurance : shackleton\'s legendary antarctic expedition "" \nin 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . \n28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \ndirector george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton\'s legendary antarctic expedition . "" \nthe expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \nas the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \nfor months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \nshackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \nonce on this "" safe "" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \nhe and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world\'s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \nmiraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \nthis ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \nin the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \nthe title of this fascinating documentary , "" the endurance , "" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \nit is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \nthe name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \nit also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \nwith astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \nthe filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \nafter the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \nconsidering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world\'s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \n ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , "" south , "" an interesting companion piece for "" the endurance . "" \nif shackleton\'s original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \nas you watch the story of "" the endurance "" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \n ( shackleton\'s amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \nthere are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . \nactor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \nthe nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary\'s first half . \nas the crew\'s adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . \nhelmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of "" the endurance , "" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . \ni can\'t think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . \n "" the endurance , "" based on caroline alexander\'s book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . \ni give it a b+ . \n'",1

"b'here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . \nthese kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . \nthat is not to say that i don\'t like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven\'t a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags . \nobserve the opening sequence . \na band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . \nthey are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . \nhowever , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . \nhe is undecided . \nthis happens for about 10 seconds . \nthe audience finds some humor in his foolishness . \nthe lights suddenly go out . \ncisco is surprised and says : "" whoa . . . let\'s \ngo !

"b""it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . \nusually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . \nto qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . \nbut today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . \nby the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . \nnot in these times . \nall you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . \nwithout sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . \nwhich brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . \nnot only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . \nwith all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . \nyou also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . \nblade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . \nthe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . \nit's all hokum and nonsense , of course . \nbut the filmmakers play it straight . \nunfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . \nyou know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . \nanother tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . \nalso it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . \nhe must also be proficient in the martial arts . \nwhy a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . \n ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) \nwesley snipes is buff as blade . \nhe growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . \nblade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . \nthis dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . \ntoday's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . \nthey are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . \nthey are more farcical than frightful . \nthis whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . \n""",0

"" \nactually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \nit\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did . \nof course , it\'s fine that he\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \njudging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation . \nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \nwhen "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \ndramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\'s mostly confused . \nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo\'s "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \nsome tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\'s not that easy . \n "" mandingo "" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 ) . \nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 ) . \nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on "" serpico . "" \njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \nso why is "" mandingo "" so bad ? \na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \nwexler\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( "" yessuh , massuh "" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( "" fer whut\'re you gittin\' outta bed ? "" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( "" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! "" ) . \nfleischer\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \ndespite its exploitative nature , "" mandingo "" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \neven classics such as "" gone with the wind "" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \n "" mandingo "" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \nwith a little more maturity and different handling , "" mandingo "" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but "" mandingo "" never does it . \nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in "" schindler\'s list "" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \nthe difference between that film and "" mandingo "" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \n "" mandingo "" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its "" trashy potboiler "" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \n'",0
"b""seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \n""",1
"b'certainly no one would rent ed wood\'s glen or glenda ? \nexpecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn\'t know was possible . \nin fact , wood\'s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . \nwatching glen or glenda ? \ni found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious . \nthe movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend\'s clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time .

"b' "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\'s a great director and one who\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit\'s worse than that . \nit\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\'s classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that\'s not the worst part of it : it\'s that it\'s the one person you didn\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\'t rely on rick\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \nit\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , "" blow out , "" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\'s earlier "" carlito\'s way , "" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\'t so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\'d be given , and perhaps he\'d have to make a choice between who\'s he has to believe . \nnow there\'s a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n'",0

"b""synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure . \neveryone else around him has similar symptoms . \nlester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain . \nhis wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans . \nand these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living . \nthe only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father . \nwhen lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family . \nwill lester regain his ability to appreciate life ? \nopinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone . \nlikewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it . \nsometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world . \nthe deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty . \namerican beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie . \nthe thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum . \nthe movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is . \nif you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty . \n""",1
"b'you\'ve heard all the hype . \nyou\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler\'s list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \nif you\'ve read any reviews , you\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \nyou also may have heard that this one\'s too kiddie-friendly , and doesn\'t have enough content for adults . \nbelieve the hype . \nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \nbut there\'s something missing here , and it isn\'t budget or effects - it\'s everything money * can\'t * buy . \nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \nportman\'s queen amidala and mcgregor\'s obi-wan kenobi don\'t fare nearly so well . \namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\'s batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\'s one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\'s master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . "" \nso , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn\'t do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . "" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he\'s done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat\'s not jake lloyd\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\'s future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n "" his future is clouded . "" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n'",1
"b""don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare . \nno one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that . \nany moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness . \nthis movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . \noh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' . \nit is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama . \nbut i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . \nso is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . \ni think not . \nas for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? \ni think not . \nin many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . \nanother sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you . \n""",0

"b'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \nedward zwick\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \nyou\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \nthe original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . "" \nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \ni don\'t know if it\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \nit\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\'s development . \nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \nit\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\'ve been getting throughout the year . \nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \nfor example , it\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \nunfortunately , there\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \n'",1

"b'talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit\'s intended as a sort of hard day\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn\'t really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\'t decide if he\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\'s manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n'",0
"b'i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . \nit certianly isn\'t for every taste , and it\'s sheer torture to sit through if you\'re in a restless mood . \nthat said , if you are in the right mood , it\'s absolutely incredible . \nthis was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . \nperhaps the big turn-off for many was this film\'s unconventionality . \ni\'d be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i\'ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . \non my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn\'t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . \nthe first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . \nit exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . \nand then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . \nthe majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . \nthe artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . \nthe battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion ) . \nthey\'re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . \nthe second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . \nthe only problems come during the first and third acts . \nmalick takes a little too long to get the film started . \nalthough the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers\' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . \nthe film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . \nthe final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it\'s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . \nthat said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . \nthe performances are phenominal all around . \nthe two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . \nnolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . \nhis character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . \ncaviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there\'s any deeper meaning to the hell that he\'s going through . \nhe is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . \nalthough restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company\'s pessimistic seargent . \nas to how it stacks up to "" saving private ryan "" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , "" ryan "" was my first . \nit\'s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won\'t , beyond saying that spielberg\'s film had more of an impact on me . \nhowever , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would "" the thin red line "" above "" ryan ) . \ni highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . \nall in all , "" the thin red line "" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . \nit\'s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . \nit\'s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don\'t come along very often . \n'",1
"b""to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . \nit is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . \nit has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . \nworse , there's the promise of a sequel . \nwhy ? ! \nsave your money . \nsome films go quickly to video . \nthis one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . ' \nin the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species . \nmost of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) . \nsurvivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives . \nthe aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons . \ndimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . ' \ntravolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . \nmuch of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations . \nhe routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . \nbut one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . \nwhen the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . \nhe will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . \nit's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . \nthe scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader . \na psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . \nbut the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . \nthis enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment . \nit also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . \n`we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says . \n`but first , we need a few more supplies . ' \nin days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . \nby now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . \nthe media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . \nnumerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . \nand after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . \nthis is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? \nat a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . \nboth films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . \nin addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . \nthis film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . \nthe controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . \nthis led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . \nbut the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . \nif the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . \nlike terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . \ncould that be the scientology message ? \n""",0

"b'a big surprise to me . \nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \nthey replaced him just fine . \nnot with john goodman , he didn\'t do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who\'s ten . \nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he\'s a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \ni\'m quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \nthere\'s a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \nit\'s just the music . \none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway\'s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there\'s no problems with this . \nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can\'t sing , all the musicians do a great job . \nthe only real problems i had was the special effects . \nthese were superfluous and a waste of money . \nsince the film isn\'t doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . \nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide . \n-- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/ \nremove no spam to reply . \n "" drive carefully but recklessly "" , mama , child\'s toy "" the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise .

"b'review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) \ncast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole\' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch \nrating : good shot ( stars ) \nlanguid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . \njuxtaposing the samurai\'s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor\'s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era . \ndirector jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit . \nusing a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film . \nhe doesn\'t cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies . \nthe action is presented in flat , brutal codas . \nbullets have permanence . \ndeath has consequences . \nthe movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty . \nit is an anti-movie , of sorts . \nthere are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . \nthis isn\'t a film that lovingly holds your hand . \nthere are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . \nthe fulcrum for the movie\'s thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . \na twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . \nunlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . \nhe wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . \nthere are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . \nhe uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . \nghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . \nlife consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . \nghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \nhe craves nothing more . \nas he puts it late in the film , "" i\'ve seen all i want to see . "" \nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \nghost dog wasn\'t always as he is presented . \nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\'s world . \neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \nit\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\'s surrealistic nature . \nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \nby film\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \nthe other person in ghost dog\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\'s dog\'s sense of honor . ) \nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\'s use , his face . \nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \n'",1
"b'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \nthe mummy \nbrendan fraser\'s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . \nfraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . \nit\'s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . \nbut who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can\'t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . \nfraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . \nbasically , it\'s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . \nhis plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . \nof course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising\'s kevin j . o\'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and \nguess what ? \nyup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . \nfire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep\'s plan begins to unfold . \nok , so it\'s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . \nthe special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn\'t half bad either . \nthe action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . \nno , it\'s no phantom menace beater , but if you\'re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won\'t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . \nif this doesn\'t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . \n'",1
"b'retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) \na film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson \ni once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted "" . \nand by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . \nalthough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . \ntwo points in the movie\'s favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . \nand like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . \nthe story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . \nfor reasons we won\'t go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . \nthe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . \nthat scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? \nand don\'t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they\'re buried ? \nanyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . \nfulci\'s graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film\'s flimsy script and plodding direction . \nthe dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . \nnot bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious "" lets explain the plot "" type approach . \nmccoll doesn\'t have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . \nand the geezer ( the actor\'s name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . \nchristopher george\'s performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don\'t care . \nin fact we don\'t care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn\'t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . \nas a director , some of fulci\' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . \nhe constantly uses extreme close-ups of people\'s eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren\'t capable of . \nand despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . \nlong-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that\'s quite frankly embarrassing . \nfulci\'s other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . \nfor completists only . \n'",0
"b'dr . alan grant ( sam neill , "" jurassic park "" ) is becoming disillusioned . \npaleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter . \nhis lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up . \nwhen the kirbys ( william h . macy , "" fargo "" ; tea leoni , "" the family man "" ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of "" the lost world "" ) he\'s disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders . \nhowever the kirbys haven\'t given dr . grant their real agenda in "" jurassic park iii .

"b'one of the 90s\' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it\'s the "" ___ from hell "" movie ! \nstarting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! \nthere were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell . \nbut hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! ! \nthe mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange . \nshe has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan . \nher son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan . \nbut those intentions are about to change . \nyou see , martha lives by manipulation . \nshe has used it in years past to breed many championship horses . \nnow , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson . \nthough at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha\'s web of deception . \nit\'s hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha\' schemes . \nas written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted . \nbut then , the film even treats the audience like idiots . \nit tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye . \nthen again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn\'t one that\'s likely to question details . \njessica lange\'s martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can . \na character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy . \ngwyneth paltrow doesn\'t have much to build upon , as helen\'s only character trait seems to be "" daughter-in-law "" . \nstill , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he\'s inexplicably missing for much of the film . \nstill , there have been much worse "" ____ from hell "" films . \neven with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion . \nyou know what\'s coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two . \nthe old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn\'t mean they taste fresh . \n'",0
"b'it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that . \nand so it is . \n_the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i\'ve seen since i-don\'t-know-when . \ndon\'t credit carrey . \nit starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago . \nthe story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience . \n ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that "" reality-based "" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . \nwho knew ? ) \none-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . \nweir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . \nit was weir\'s first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . \nfor example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . \nthe nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . \ncredit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . \ncarrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near . \nnot here . \nhis performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . \nand although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably . \nplaying one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey\'s life . \nno pun intended . \nbetter in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman\'s megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . \nit is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman\'s well being . \nyes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . \nhe thinks . \nrounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . \ndalloway ) as carrey\'s true "" forbidden love "" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . \nlaura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman\'s wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . \nthe exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . \nthere are other little problems with the script . \nare we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? \nwas there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? \nhow is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? \nand couldn\'t christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? \nthese little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . \nthe audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman\'s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . \nthe final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . \nupon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . \njust checking . \n'",1
"b""set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . \nhis dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . \ninstead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . \ntherefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . \ndue to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . \nhe arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff's murder . \nwhen marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . \nin the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . \nwith the rumpo's past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! \nsid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground . \njim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . \nother regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . \nbig heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . \njoan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . \nhowever , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee's performance is rather poor . \nkenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the 'judge' . \neven so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite . \na very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . \nthe death count is the highest of any carry on film . \nsets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable . \nthe songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie's song ) are very impressive . \na strange but therefore very interesting carry on film . \nnot the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series . \n""",1
"b""note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nfloating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . \na compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . \nfloating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . \nthe film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . \nwith their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . \nthis sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . \nthe tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . \nfloating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . \nmeanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . \namong the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . \nthe one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . \nemotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . \nhis desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . \nms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . \nfloating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . \nhowever , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . \nfloating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . \n""",1
"b'seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o\'shea for $5 . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nthe big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \ngluttony is hollywood\'s favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \n "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \nit\'s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \naudiences\' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers\' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it\'s impossible to care about anything that happens . \nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth\'s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it\'s obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments . \nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it\'s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it\'s laughable . \nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \nwe\'re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it\'s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \nit\'s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite . \nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \nbut there\'s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it\'s presented in such a ridiculous way it\'s utterly boring . \nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \n "" lost in space "" is major film production at its worst . \nit\'s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \n'",0

"b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \nthat main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . "" \nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\'s cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" ) . \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \nif that doesn\'t give you a good idea of this film\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\'s rug . \nthey\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\'s "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \nthe film doesn\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \nthere\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech . \nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! "" \nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on . \nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least "" aggression "" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on "" passive , "" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n "" it\'s good knowin\' he\'s out there , the dude , takin\' it easy , "" posits the narrator towards the end . \ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \n'",1

"b'this is the worst movie i\'ve seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way "" . \nit is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . \nit is crap through and through . \nnothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" ) . \nhere\'s a man who admits he\'s a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . \nbut truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . \nnot all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . \nthere is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . \nthey set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners . \nit turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . \nbut that\'s par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger\'s lines . \nas mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . \nthis is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass . \npersonally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn\'t retake scenes to make him understandable . \ncompare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin "" . \napparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . \numa thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . \nher poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . \nand her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she\'s reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment . \ngiven the "" script "" , it\'s a wonder it didn\'t happen more frequently . \nthere is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o\'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl . \nmichael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . \nin fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . \nunfortunately , every scene about alfred\'s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . \nthe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there\'s a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . \nthere\'s never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . \nthe only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . \neven then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable . \nthe hockey team from hell ? \nnot even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that "" batman & robin "" showcases ) . \nfrustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . \nblink , and you\'ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a "" why is she even in the film "" vamp in freeze\'s lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . \nand in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn\'t even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she\'s quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . \nand as if the film weren\'t bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . \ni know it\'s nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character\'s arms aren\'t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze\'s weapon creates tons if ice . \nthat\'s all traditional comic book stuff . \nbut why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? \nwhy is there a big switch clearly marked , "" heat "" in mr . freeze\'s lair ? \nwhy do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? \nwhy does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? \nwhy do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? \nand since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don\'t they wear masks to filter it out ? \ni could go on and on . \n "" batman & robin "" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the "" worst film of the year "" by the time 1998 rolls along . \nnote to warner bros . -- if you\'re going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone . \nbecause it could actually get worse than this . \nwhat schumacher does not understand is that "" comic book "" doesn\'t automatically equal unbearable idiocy . \nthe true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy . \n'",0

"b' "" . . it\'s certainly more than just a monster story . . "" \n- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley\'s frankenstein . \nkenneth branagh\'s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . \nthe dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . \nbut the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . \nhorror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . \nbranagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . \nhis version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . \nthe film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . \nthe year is 1794 . \na bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . \nhis gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . \nas the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . \nit\'s a man . \nexhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . \nhis name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . \nthe myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . \nhe is remembering his childhood and youth . \nlaughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . \nhere victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . \nthis idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . \nlike thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . \nshocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . \nstanding on his mother\'s grave he says : "" oh mother . . you \ndid not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i \nwill stop this . . i \npromiss . . "" \nafter proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . \nafter a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . \ncomposing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . \nwith strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . \nthe result was ugliness . \nrealizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . \nthe creature has escaped . \nbecause of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . \nfor a while everything is as it was before his mother\'s death . \nbut then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . \nwhale\'s picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . \nbrannagh has more or less done that . \nanother thing is characters and actors . \nbranagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . \nthe greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . \nalone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . \nat first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . \nlater when he reads frankenstein\'s journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . \nhe is capable of killing without regret . \n "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and \nthen i slowly crushed his neck . . . and \nas i killed him , i saw your face . . "" \nthat is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . \nand yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : "" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . "" \nrarely has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . \nanother vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . \nin most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . \nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein\'s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley\'s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : "" . . all \ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \nmy hand . . "" . \nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator\'s body on fire . \nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature\'s smiling face . \ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film "" dracula "" . \nin comparison , i can say that "" dracula "" has visuals that even "" frankenstein "" can not live up to . \nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , "" frankenstein "" is stronger . \nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan\'s "" interview with the vampire "" . \nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly\'s classic novel . \n'",1

"b'the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one . \nthis lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . \nthe church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained . \nin these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson . \njan is on leave from the oilrig and bess . . \nis just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first . \nat the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however . \nbut bess is suffering in this scary religious society . \nwe soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell . \nwomen are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church . \nwhen the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit . \nthe time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves . \nshe can\'t stand the thought of life without her husband . \nwe witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? ) \nconvincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard . \nan accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down . \nnow he can\'t satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail . \nat first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply . \nimagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? \nthe story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . \nthe use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . \nthe incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . \ni would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . \nemily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the "" grand prix du jury "" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the "" palme d\'or "" ) . \nthe screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere . \n'",1
"b'every year , hollywood crowns a new "" it boy "" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \ninheriting the mantle from last year\'s "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham\'s the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola\'s take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy\'s ( and the film\'s ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola\'s most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy\'s unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company\'s hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy\'s often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon\'s intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will\'s burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will\'s best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will\'s harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will\'s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham\'s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n'",1

"b'of all the films i\'ve come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments . \ni\'m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . \nand i think i\'m the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . \nusually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign . \nwaiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it\'s 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event . \nthe play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success . \nteaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o\'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others . \neverybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out . \nthese characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can\'t help but love them , as pathetic as they really are . \nalthough levy stands out , guest , willard , o\'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! \nif there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it . \nsome humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros . \nas delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous . \nthankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . \nlike a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) . \nlike i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach . \nyou can\'t really watch these people and not think they\'re real people ! \neven they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don\'t feel staged at all , you feel like you\'re watching a real , albeit funny , documentary . \nand even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful ! \nas a word of note , despite it\'s "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean . \nthis rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words . \neven if that really bothers you , let me say that it\'s not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way . \nit\'s actually quite humorous and tastefully done ! \nit might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman . \nit\'s silly humor , but it\'s also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you\'re not insulted by it . \nit\'s always really nice to see a comedy that isn\'t all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones ! \ni\'d recommend seeing it ! \n'",1
"b""take a look at the following equation . . . . \na christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged \nyes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . \nscrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . \nbill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . \nhe's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . \nhowever , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . \nfrank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . \nhe also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . \nhowever , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . \nsadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . \nwhoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . \nand the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) \nwho , thankfully , dosen't say much . \nthe script is horrendous . \nmichael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . \nand he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . \nthe special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . \nthere's some impressive make up effects also . \nthe music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . \nbut great effects and make up don't make a great film . \nscrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . \nwhy didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? \noverall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \n""",0
"b'synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii . \nrafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action . \ndanny falls in love with rafe\'s girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend . \nmeanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . . \nreview : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art . \nit is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . \nit is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . \nsadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left . \nthe plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . \nthere is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . \ninstead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , "" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant "" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . \nto the movie\'s credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war . \nif only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching . \n'",0
"b""in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \nthere are two predominant images of new york . \nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \n""",1
"b'\'contact\' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses . \nsee contact with your family . \nit is a movie for all ages . \n--a review by stuart cracraft \ncontact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star \nafter a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison\'s work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side . \nby the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what\'s out there . \nthis movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . \nhowever , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . \nhadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . \nhurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . \nthis one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . \nthis is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . \nfoster\'s radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . \nearly scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . \nthe movie\'s pacing is very good and subtle . \nthe panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . \nthe politics of foster\'s character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . \none of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . \nthere were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . \nit is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . \neverything else was very one-sided ( e . g . \nfoster ) . \nlowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . \nthe core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . \nit feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley\'s scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster\'s case , an illusion drawn from her memory . \nin another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry\'s star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . \nthe concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . \nbut the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . \nfreed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . \nas the movie gains speed , foster\'s acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . \nit is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . \nthe supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . \nin fact , zemeckis et . \nal . \ngot in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . \nbut the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton\'s walk-ons . \nthe much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . \nalso , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . \ncontact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . \nperhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden . \n'",1
"b""jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \n""",1
"b""the happy bastard's quick movie review \nholy man \nmore like holy crap . \nthe film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . \nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . \nit's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . \nat this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . \nit doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . \nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . \nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . \nsome may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . \nat least he has something for us to laught at . . . \n""",0

"b""i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . \nit's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football . \nunfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers . \nin altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics . \nwe see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook . \nit grows tiresome and monotonous . \nyes , stone has pulled a brian depalma . \nmatters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go . \ntony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut . \naging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad . \nwhen cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game . \nonce in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field . \nnerves , you see . \neventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like . \nand i believe it . \nthere is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball . \nthe problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate . \nfootball is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush . \ni guess he is mistaken . \n`any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them . \nmany football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game . \nin return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering . \nin welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction . \nfor instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch . \nthere is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory . \nthe stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) . \nunfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast . \npacino makes some interesting progress with his character . \nyou begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . . \nbut i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics . \n`any given sunday' is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique . \nand a very distant back seat , at that . \n""",0
"b'driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . \nit\'s a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . \nbut if you\'re patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry\'s pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \nwe\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\'s gentle humor . \nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\'s loving and patient son . \ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( "" good times "" ) , and boolie\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\'s dramatic moments . \nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \n'",1
"b'with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \'90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . \nfor the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . \nlola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . \nit seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . \nthis gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . \nso she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life . \n>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like "" sliding doors on steroids . \nwith a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . \nindeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . \nvery much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . \nthe way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . \nthematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . \nwhile you are watching , this will not matter . \nrunning a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . \nit is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'",1
"b'roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . \nben kingsley ? "" \nmy response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \ngary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . \nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . \nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . \nthe first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . \nthe second punch comes from gal\'s past . \nback in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv\'s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . \nhe sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . \ndon will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly . "" \nhowever , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy\'s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . \nin the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody\'s skin . \nkingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . \nthere are some serious problems in louis mellis\'s and david scinto\'s script that should have been caught before filming . \nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \nbeyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . \nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for . \nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . \nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \nin spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . \ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . \nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . \nthe old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . \nit is not a great plot . \nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . \nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . \nit is an old plot dressed up to look new . \nif the plot is old , at least the style is creative . \nthis is director jonathan glazer\'s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . \nwe see one side of a person\'s faces . \nbut the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . \nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . \nus yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . \nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . \nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . \nthe plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley\'s high-powered performance . \ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",0

"b'the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up . \nthe film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood . \nhrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india . \nhrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn\'t cut out for the job . \non the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse . \nduring the filming of this movie set in the 1800\'s , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can . \nthis includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set . \nmany of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever . \nand when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j . \nedward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi\'s ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi . \nclutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood . \nbut when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck\'s exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur . \nof course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble . \neach scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can\'t handle , is almost always very humorous . \nand each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way . \nthe party can be compared to many other films of it\'s type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations . \nit also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) . \nif you\'re in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party . \nit\'s not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you\'ll enjoy the party . \n'",1
"b""8mm is not going to enlighten your day . \nit's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . \nnot only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . \nnicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . \nhe wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . \ncage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . \nat home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . \nhis new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . \nthe film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . \nor so it seems . \nwelles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . \nand the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . \nhe hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . \nmax knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . \nthe devil changes you . ' \nthese turn out to be very wise words . \n8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . \nthe set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . \nthis is where everything goes awry . \nalthough director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . \neverything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . \nalthough it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . \ncage is the film's sole flame of energy . \nhis performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . \nstill , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . \nwelles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . \nthis is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . \nhe tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . \nwritten by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . \nfurthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? \nthe director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . \nthis putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . \n""",0
"b'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker , "" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino . "" \nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \'everything being made now is crap\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \n ( as if that\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\'ll make of popular scientologists . \npacing stricter\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \nmurphy\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing . "" \nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\'s invention . \nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \nmartin\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading "" cahiers du cinema , "" or martin\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \nbowfinger\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \nwe\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem "" chubby rain , "" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \nmartin gets sentimental by story\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \n'",1

"b'the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as \'anywhere but here . \' \nthere isn\'t one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . \nit relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn\'t figure it out for themselves . \nif the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . \nalvin sargent\'s script was weak and annoyingly claustral . \nwayne wang\'s ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn\'t convey . \npushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills . \nthe daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life . \nthe daqughter doesn\'t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can\'t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio . \nso it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . \nadele\'s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn\'t look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive . \ndaughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there . \nduring one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel . \nwith the cop\'s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . \nduring their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s . \neliot ( corbin allred ) reader . \nbut the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . \nwhen she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn\'t clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly . \nthe film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams . \ni guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother\'s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . \nmother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . \nbut mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . \nshe learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . \nthis of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom\'s heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . \nthis was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . \n'",0
"b""i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome . \nnever in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan . \nfor the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly . \nthe same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well . \nhowever , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect . \nhis last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great . \nlike rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb . \nnow chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men . \nthe trailer for the film sums it up quite well . \nfirst strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them . \njackie chan is a regular comedian . \nwell , he's no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up . \nfor example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) . \neven the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame . \nbut never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident . \nwith some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention . \n , \n""",1

"b""everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' \nin this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . \nthe film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . \ndr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . \nthe bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . \n'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . \nthe spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's \nhumans . \nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs . \nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . \nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . \nif it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . \nthe director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . \nthere are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . \nif the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . \nin fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . \nthere is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . \nthe camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . \nthe peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . \nsorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . \nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . \ntheir reasonable good fun , however . \nmimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . \nlike dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . \nit may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . \nbut looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . \na good opportunity , then , wasted . \na shame . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 \n""",0

"b'come on hollywood , surprise me . \nstop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . \nthe always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . \npersonal , because his niece is one of the victims . \nit\'s a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there\'s a twist . \nfreeman notes that each of the young women who\'ve disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . \nwe soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to "" dominate "" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . \nanyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , \nyou know the rest . \na brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . \nperhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . \nso lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? \nand as for comparisons to seven . . . oh \nplease ! \nkiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . \nmaybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it\'s the writing that\'s clearly at fault here . \none , these characters have very little to say that\'s engaging or interesting . \ntwo , the script has no sense of humour . \nthree , while the notion of a psycho\'s victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn\'t even half as good as the idea . \nthus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . \nwe can\'t feel her rage . \nsome atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she\'s the no-bullshit 90\'s type , but these conversations barely register . \nand as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . \nfor an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . \nyoung director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . \nbut what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? \nnot much , and you can hardly blame him . \nthere\'s a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . \nbut the script is beyond rescue . \nwhat hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . \ncomplacency rules : it\'s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . \nthe only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren\'t free . . . . \n . \n'",0

"b""ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \n""",1

"b'movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . \noccasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called "" teenagers .

"b'what hath kevin williamson wrought ? \nwhile the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . \nthose williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ . \nadd to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy . \nthe influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas . \nfirst , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling . \nthis sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer\'s look . \ndressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , \nsans the hook . \none thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise . \nstudents at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of "" mythology "" passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness . \nit hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn\'t ) . \nmichelle , slain by the "" killer lurking in the backseat "" of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well . \nthe setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares . \ntoo many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film\'s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door . \nbut that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there\'s also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre . \nbanks and horta\'s ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor . \nsome laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i\'m not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . \nthe filmmakers don\'t get much help from their onscreen talent . \ni was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ \nstarlet jennifer love hewitt , but i\'d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto . \n_dawson\'s_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor . \ngranted , the cast is hampered by their material . \nloretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard . \nthe recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive . \nif other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers\' many victims . \n'",0

"b'the previews for the movie are pretty good . \nthey show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . \nunfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . \nthe residents of mystery love hockey . \nmystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . \nthe townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who\'s guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that\'s one of the movie\'s jokes . ) \nevery saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . \nthe town\'s prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . \nmystery\'s national fame has the town abuzz . \na week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . \nthe new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . \nthe mysterians see this as both good and bad . \non the one hand , they\'d love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . \non the other hand , they don\'t want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . \nthe movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . \nbiebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . \nhe\'s already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . \ncrowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he\'s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . \ncharlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man\'s worth . \nhis "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater . \nhe hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . \nburt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . \nwalter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . \nhe wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . \nreynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . \none character actually was interesting . \nbiebe\'s wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . \nbut unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . \nshe chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . \nher unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . \nmysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning . \nthe biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about . \ninstead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o\'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . \nthey try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . \nthey present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there\'s nothing truly funny . \nthey show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about . \nas columnist molly ivins would say , it\'s all hat , no cattle . \nthe perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . \nthere is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . \nit is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what\'s truly important . \nrussell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie\'s metaphor for us . \nhe says that what really matters in life is "" community . . . .

"b'we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80\'s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \nin the 1950\'s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher\'s house . \nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \nhis teacher isn\'t home . \nwe pull back and see that the dark front room\'s window has it\'s curtains open . \nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \ndavid\'s fall over the dark cliff has begun . \ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction "" . \nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \nadult-helfgott\'s return to the light is told in linear fashion . \nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \ntaylor\'s teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov\'s 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \nbut it\'s us being clapped . \nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \nand it works very well . \nthe \'miming\' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn\'t mime ; he really did play ) \nhelfgott\'s life is certainly not without it\'s sympathetic people . \nindeed his return to the \'normal\' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \nit shows that with the \'help of god\' we can all find our way back home . \n'",1

"b'capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback\'s baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that\'s the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that\'s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we\'re not used to seeing on screen . \nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( "" by an all-white jury "" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it\'s hardly surprising why . \nthere\'s a good deal of sex in the movie , but it\'s handled in a way that\'s unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend\'s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \nwe\'re not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles\' hands . \none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one\'s own mind . \nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \n'",1

"b'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \nit\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with "" trinity "" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as "" morpheus "" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually "" the one "" prophesized to come and save the world . \nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \nweaving\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \nthe matrix isn\'t a classic . \nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \njust don\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \n'",1
"b'after hearing reviews for woody allen\'s upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \nwoody allen\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\'t help but feel visibly moved . \nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane . \nbeethoven\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\'s all rather lovely to look at . \nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \nit\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\'s "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close ) . \nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \n "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \n "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \n "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film . \neven "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \nif anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\'s him . \n "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \nand he\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \nit\'s like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\'s flaws to be more apparent . \nwoody\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \nbranagh\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\'re still not sure if he\'s really a good person or not . \nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" ) . \nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita . "" \nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i\'ve become the kind of woman i\'ve always hated . . . and \ni\'m loving it . "" ) \nwithout doing a thing . \nthe result is a film of highs and mediums . \nthe mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don\'t exactly work but you can\'t help but pat allen on the back for trying . \nbut other places are really great scenes . \nthe opening . \nthe sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn\'t ended . \na banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . \nand , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they\'d never look at him the same way . \nhe ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . \nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . \nallen\'s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i\'d almost recommend the film . \nalmost . \nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it\'s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it\'s still a smart and insightful film . \nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it\'d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they\'re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis\' character . \nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm\'s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \nbesides , it\'s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen\'s : that great woody allen feel . \nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen\'s oeuvre , it\'s merely a blip ( no "" annie hall "" but it\'s no "" shadows and fog "" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \n'",1

"b""i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . \nif there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon . \nthis is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original . \nbut i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . \nyou see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection . \nbut what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ? \nthat is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad . \ni've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much . \nit has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access . \nobviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) . \nthe three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi . \nof the three , only danes has a real character . \nribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes . \nwhen the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations . \nall kinds of good stuff ! \nthe only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments . \nalthough ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance . \nepps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity . \nbut the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting . \na drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . \nclaire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . \nshe could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . \nepps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been . \nthe mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it . \nit's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time . \nnothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for . \nclaire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out . \nthere are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . \ndo not be fooled . \nsome may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare . \n""",0

"b'it\'s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts . \nbut that\'s just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic\'s big screen debut . \nuhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid . \nbut it\'s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it\'s so silly and outrageous it\'s hilarious . \nthe movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he\'s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns . \ngeorge is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks . \nbut george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station . \ngeorge revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like "" wheel of fish "" and movies like "" conan , the librarian . "" \nas the station\'s ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate . \nas r . j . \nfletcher--channel 8\'s ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . \nuhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children\'s shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . \nthe funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . \nlike most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . \nfor every gag that works , at least one fizzles . \nfor instance , weird al\'s mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . \nbut the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . \nin fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . \nwell , since airplane . \nmuch of the credit goes to weird al\'s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie\'s winsome cast . \nweird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he\'s not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character . \nthe real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children\'s show : "" stanley spadowski\'s playhouse . "" \nstanley\'s off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star . \nhe is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness . \nand above all , he\'s a good janitor who adores his work . \nanother highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips . \nthe cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , "" wheel of fish . "" \nalso aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62\'s roving reporter . \nunfortunately , as weird al\'s girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking . \nher character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether . \nwhile uhf is not an absolute must-see , it\'s definitely the ticket if you\'re looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy . \nthe movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun . \n'",1
"b""every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . \nmost of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . \nbut , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . \ni love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . \nthe impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . \nwhich surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show . \nsuch things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . \nthe plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . \ntwo of them are assigned to cover the train collision . \nas soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . \nthe plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . \nmovie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . \nhowever , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest . \nit probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . \nshyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . \nthe end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . \ni'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though . \n""",0

"b""i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \nhe's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \nhe's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . \nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \non the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \nthere is some character development during the film . \nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . \nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . \nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \noverall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \n""",1
"b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \nthey\'ve been cremated . \nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \nthe premise is basically the same . \nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \nof course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \nthere isn\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \nit\'s really just a skit movie . \nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \na good example of the latter would be last year\'s black sheep . \nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\'t really fit into a movie mold . \nin these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \nsuch is the case with this movie\'s mini-plots . \nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\'t funny . \nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \nchase plays clark griswold really well . \nhe made the character and he is the character . \nd\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\'t show any signs of redemption . \nas for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind . \nthe "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \nthey\'re so generic , you\'ll expect the credits to read "" girl #1 as audrey griswold "" . \nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \nyes , it\'s true that vegas vacation isn\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\'s heading on the title ? \ni couldn\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \nthat\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\'t . \nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \nthe first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\'s including mr . \nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \nwowzers ! \nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \nlooking at the names , you\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\'s . \nwell that\'s not all . \nthis guy also brought us 90\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \nvegas vacation , however , didn\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\'s not . \nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\'s quite out of place . \nstephen kessler\'s jejune direction doesn\'t help things either . \nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \neach consecutive "" vacation "" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \nnot too bad . \nthen we had national lampoon\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \nlastly we had national lampoon\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \nif you loved the "" vacation "" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\'t anything here worth seeing . \nif you loved them , don\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

"b'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? \n "" gattaca "" is a film which presents a future where society has answered "" yes "" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \n "" gattaca "" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true . \ncontrary to the misleading trailers , "" gattaca "" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there\'s lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who\'s novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children ) . \nit\'s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what "" gattaca "" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it\'s as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . \nbut one day , he finds out that it\'s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( "" wings "" \' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in \'97 : "" men in black , "" "" a life less ordinary "" . . . ) , who\'s client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . \nfortunately , though , there\'s no record of the accident , and he\'s willing to give someone else his life . \nsince vincent looks a bit like him . . . \nafter a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . \nthere , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who\'s genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man\'s stats are . \nhowever , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome\'s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent\'s long lost brother , anton , who hasn\'t seen him since they were teenagers . \nwe know vincent/jerome didn\'t do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome\'s in trouble , but also the real jerome , who\'s as much in it as he is . \nhowever , there isn\'t many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it\'s message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . \nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . \nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . \nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . \nirene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . \nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . \nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it\'s a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn\'t have the down ending of other works of this kind . \nthe production design of this film is probably the best i\'ve seen this year : it\'s stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . \nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . \nand the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . \nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . \nthe acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . \nbut the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he\'s in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . \ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i\'m not sure of . \n "" gattaca "" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we\'ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . \nand when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . \n'",1
"b""this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \ngood music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . \nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . \ni don't . \n . \navoid . \n""",0

"b'the crown jewel of 1970\'s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \nposeidon\'s big new year\'s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \nlet\'s see , there\'s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to "" pray to that part of god within yourself . "" \nthere\'s the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . \nthere\'s the hippie singer ( "" there\'s got to be a morning after . . . "" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . \nand to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . \nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . \neveryone\'s in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . \nthe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . \nin this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . \nor is the bottom the top ? \neither way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . \nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . \nit\'s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . \nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . \nthe one note in borgnine\'s one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn\'t a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they\'ll live to see their grandson\'s birth . \nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . \nwinters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her "" fatass "" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . \n "" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , "" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she\'s swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) \nridden thighs . \nit\'s not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole . \n'",0
"b'recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . \neach review compared this film to the truman show . \nwhy ? \nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg\'s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it\'s long been on the video store shelves . \nsure , it wasn\'t perfect , and it wasn\'t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . \nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm\'s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50\'s sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents . \nhis twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . \nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90\'s terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she\'s supposed to be . \nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . \ntheir new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . \nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . \nit\'s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don\'t want it to end . \n "" mary sue "" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . \nsoon we learn that these people don\'t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . \nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the "" coloreds "" and the "" black & whites . "" \nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , "" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . .

"b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\'s "" black private dick that\'s a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \nthis fact also explains why john singleton\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\'s plot doesn\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\'s _shaft\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \nbut that\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\'s way toward commanding this film . \npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \nhowever , he isn\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \nit\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\'s impressive star turn doesn\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\'s sidekick rasaan . \nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \n ( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\'t even have one sex scene . ) \nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\'s not really an action director . \nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\'s just that there\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\'re unsurprising and conventional . \nbut if there\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \nstyle doesn\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\'s of little consequence . \nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \n'",1
"b'the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . \nhe attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . \nafter they ricochet off his face , he says , "" not a good start .

"b'one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy\'s wedding . \nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn\'t made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \nbut the fact is , betsy\'s wedding is also an alan alda film . \nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \nwritten and directed by alda , betsy\'s wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \nalda\'s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \nshe\'s supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \nand to make matters worse , ringwald\'s performance matches her appearance . \nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald\'s screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride\'s working-class , italian family and the groom\'s rich , gentile family . \nringwald\'s folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \nwalsh\'s clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . "" \nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film\'s most pleasant surprises . \nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \nit\'s anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \nlapaglia\'s sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \nand what\'s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \ni don\'t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia\'s over-the-top performance should not be missed . \nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda\'s unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o\'hara ) . \nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride\'s financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \nthe film adopts alda\'s psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \nas a filmmaker , alda\'s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \nand while he doesn\'t have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n'",1
"b'very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . \nthey are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . \nyou may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . \nin beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . \nbeavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . \nthey live their lives in front of the television . \nthe worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . \nthis happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . \nbeavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . \nthe two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . \neven at this point they have no idea what has happened . \nthey look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . \nbefore the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn\'t realise just how stupid . \nthis is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . \neventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . \nluck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . \nthis man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" . \nbeavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . \nthey are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" . \nto them , this is the best day of their lives . \nnot only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . \ninevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . \noddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . \nthey end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . \nthe irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . \nat old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . \nbeavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . \nthey even get to meet the president . \nbut all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . \nthis is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it\'s unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . \nthe humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . \nin the end you can\'t help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . \nin this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . \nif you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . \notherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . \none note of warning : don\'t take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you\'ll \nnever hear the end of it ! \n'",1

"" while they\'re still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen . \n'",0

"b'they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie\'s poster : "" no sequel . "" \nscary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don\'t try . \nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof . \nthe first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular . \nin scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series . \nscary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn . \nof course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive . \nbut this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project . \nsome of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . \nscary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo\'s mission : impossible 2 and charlie\'s angels . \nit is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they\'d coalesce . \nthey don\'t . \nwhile the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road . \nyou can almost hear the reels panting . \nscary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short . \nit\'s a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie . \nthe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is . \n'",0
"b'that thing you do ! \n ( r ) tom hanks\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! "" \nthe group\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \nalong for the wonders\' ride to success is jimmy\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year . "" \nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \'60s ; they do not appear to be \'90s grungers playacting "" retro .

"b'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\' acclaimed novel \'the invisible man\' . \nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \nthe director is paul verhoven . \nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \nthe problem is to keep us there . \ni can\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \nthe first two faces are completed . \nnow , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human . \ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \nbut that\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \nthough it\'s based on a novel called \'the invisible man\' , the title has been ironically changed to \'hollow man\' that sums up the film very nicely . \nthis is a very silly production . \nlaughable , actually . \napparently verhoven\'s imagination doesn\'t stretch too far . \nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\' locker room undetected . \nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\'t stop there . \nhe becomes a rapist . \nand then , of course , a murderer . \nyou\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \nshue\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \nbeing probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing . \nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \npretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \nhe was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" , "" total recall "" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \nin a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection . \nit\'s not better or worse than verhoven\'s average film . \nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\'ll be screaming "" nooooo ! "" \nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \nand all we can ask is why ? \nthe answer is simple . \nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \nit\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \na void where its imagination should be . \n'",0
"b""imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . \nso far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . \nit is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . \nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . \nminutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . \njeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . \nt walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . \nit is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . \njeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . \ndisconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \nthere , trouble arises . \nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . \nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . \nit is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were

"b'in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \nto be fair , i must admit that i\'ve never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \nperhaps it\'s because most of those i\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \nsurprised ? \nwell , so was i . \ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\'t expecting something on the order of "" war and peace "" . \nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \nand so it goes . \nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \nlet\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \naction . \nthere\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\'s to be expected . \nhowever , this isn\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \nthe primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \nthere\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" ) . \nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\'s father\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \nit\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \nthe picture is crisp and clear . \none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies , and it\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\'s to be expected in this type of film . \nif you like this kind of movie , you\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \n'",1
"b'another formula \'feel good\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \'war on drugs\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\'s drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

"b""well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . \ni don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . \nbut in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . \nthe film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . \nwayne and garth , these two are not . \nrather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . \ndriving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . \n`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . \ntheir second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . \njust as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . \nand , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . \nhowever , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . \ntheir sad lives take on a whole new direction . \nthey make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . \nand they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . \nbut their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . \nthe unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . \nactually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . \nalas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . \nthus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . \nthere's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . \ni was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . \nto take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . \nthis creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . \nshe's educated and a forebearing witch . \nmeanwhile , doug is a complete loser . \nhow did these two ever get together ? \ni suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . \nif you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury . \n""",0
"b'around the end of 1998 , a japanese cartoon came to the usa television , and really wasn\'t that big . \nin fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time . \nin fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn\'t all that bad . \nit grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million . \nfans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , "" pokemon : the movie 2000 "" which is far inferior to the original animated movie . \nfirst up is the plot , which there really isn\'t much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever . \nwell there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual . \neven though the first movie wasn\'t a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline . \nthis new movie however is nothing but garbage , there is nothing good to it storywise , and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors . \ncompared to the first film , this movie is awfully bland , from its opening titles , to the end titles it tries its best to work , but fails miserably at every corner . \nthe characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame . \neven the so called action scenes are extremely lame , and falls before it even gets a chance to go . \nthe voices even aren\'t that good and almost feels like the stars don\'t want to be there , like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie . \nwhich it certainly is . \nthe film has one thing going for it and that is the animation , although not up to disney standards , it is still very good with some interesting cgi\'s and very colorful animation , the colors jump out at you very fast , and seem very nicely put on film . \nwhy a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered , hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash . \nfor now watch the first one . \nits much much better . \n'",0
"b'sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and "" pushing tin "" certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he\'s actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . \nsometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has "" hip comedy "" written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing "" you have to be joking "" situations . \netc . \nin "" pushing tin , "" thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don\'t have an earthly . \nfrom the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , "" quirky "" credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley\'s in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for "" the full monty , "" let alone won it . \nbut i , for one , wasn\'t ready to walk just yet . \nso quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger\'s lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game . \nhip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick "" the zone "" falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz . \nof course . \nuntil some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone\'s finite air space . \nboys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins . \nit doesn\'t stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat\'s whisker of each other . \noh no . \nthere are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? \ndirector mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that\'s being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn\'t have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before . \nthe antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe . \nthey\'ll make you frown in disbelief . \nthey\'ll have you constantly looking at your watch . \nbut wait ! \nthere\'s still 100 minutes to go ! ! \nthe film\'s only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes . \nthis is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( "" oscar and lucinda "" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( "" elizabeth "" ) . \nbut she\'s not enough to save the picture . \nthornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke . \njolie ( as russell\'s knock \'em dead wife ) isn\'t bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything . \ncusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced . \nin the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases . \nbut it\'s too little too late . \na fine cast aside , "" pushing tin "" is nothing more than an embarrassment . \n'",0
"b'quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . \nafter his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . \njohn travolta made his come-back and is now one of today\'s most bankable stars . \nbruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . \njackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . \nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she\'s never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . \nthat is , until now . \njackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . \nafter mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . \njackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . \ndespite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . \npam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . \nmore than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . \ndescribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can\'t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . \ni will tread lightly . \njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . \nthe camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . \nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . \nfor a hefty price . \nms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . \nhowever , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . \nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell\'s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . \nthey try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . \nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell\'s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . \nordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . \nafter she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . \nordell doesn\'t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . \nthis scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . \nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that\'s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . \ntarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . \nhis hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . \nthey talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . \nof course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . \nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . \nof course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . \nthings are told from one person\'s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . \nthis all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . \non the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . \nhowever , this time around it isn\'t as nearly as impressive or original . \nthe writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino\'s use of slang terms offensive . \nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it\'s much more easy to understand . \nhis previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time . \nperhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . \nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . \nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . \nand as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . \nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . \nthe performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters\' actions . \nnothing is quite as it seems , and you can\'t really tell which side one person is on . \nthe real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . \nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . \nwatching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn\'t know what she was thinking . \nher face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . \nbridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . \ni didn\'t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham\'s in boogie nights ) . \nmichael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . \nchris tucker has a small , but effective performance . \nsamuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \nbut no matter . . . \njackson is very strong in his role . \nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\'s perspective clients and friends . \nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . \nas a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . \nhowever , one can not help but compare it to tarantino\'s pulp fiction , and expect great results . \nwhen compared , it comes up short , but not that short . \nit\'s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . \nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . \ni can\'t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this

"b""synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . \nthe subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . \ncomments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . \nboth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . \ninterestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . \nthis exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . \nit's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . \nunfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . \nvirtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . \nthe film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . \nmany important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . \nthe cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . \njeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . \ncarrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . \nmeschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either . \nvirtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . \nin other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch . \nthe movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . \nthis turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either . \ndon't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . \n""",0

"b'linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma\'s lead is nothing short of inexplicable . \nshe\'s still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who\'s lost her faith . \none night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany\'s bedroom . \nhe is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . \ngod would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . \nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith\'s films thus far . \nat some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . \nit\'s a wild ride . \nthey\'re in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . \nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . \nat one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . \nit\'s a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" . \nwings of desire this ain\'t . \nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \n ( chris rock is this film\'s only weak link-between jokes , he\'s wooden . ) \nhis no-frills visual style hasn\'t changed much over the years , though ( dogma\'s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma\'s pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we\'ve heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki\'s bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit\'s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ\'s , martin scorsese\'s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis\' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture\'s content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere\'s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith\'s bethany and scorsese\'s jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma\'s denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that\'s worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don\'t belong to . \nnow that\'s powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit\'s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they\'re attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i\'m no bible-thumper , i\'m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n'",1
"b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\'ll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\'s true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "" \nthat\'s not to say the men don\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \n'",1

"b""krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . \ndone poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . \nhowever , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . \nprofessor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . \nhis university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . \nhowever , he found . . . nothing . \nhis wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . \ntonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . \nrather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . \nhowever , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . \nsoon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . \nhis efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . \nkrippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . \nno one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . \nluckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . \nthough there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . \nthe double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . \nrichard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . \njenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . \neven the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . \nyes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . \nit may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . \n""",1
"b'after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . \nthis new film has been underrated for no reason . \nit is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla\'s pervious films . \nit is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . \nthe only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters . \nthe film elegantly begins with nino rota\'s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael\'s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children . \nmore than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure "" . \nthe year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father\'s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . \nmichael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . \nconstantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . \nthe family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . \nlater that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million .

"b'whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \nhe made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs . miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 ) . \nthe same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \nby the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \nthere\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman\'s trademark full-frontal female nudity . \nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham\'s other lawyer heroes . \nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn\'t hard to surmise that rick\'s womanizing had a large part in it . \nwhenever he\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it\'s because he\'s been "" screwing around . "" \nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that . \nas another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack . "" \nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory\'s begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \naltman\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \nif it isn\'t night-time , at least it\'s raining . \ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \n "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \na great deal of the credit for the film\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick\'s pain and frustration . \nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler\'s list "" ( 1993 ) . \ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \nit doesn\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \nwhile "" the gingerbread man "" isn\'t in league with altman\'s greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \nsome critics love to stamp films like this as "" commercial , "" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don\'t make money . \naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \n'",1
"b'what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60\'s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn\'t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don\'t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn\'t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! "" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n'",0

"b""capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . \nchristopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . . \nand nobody wins . \nthe hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . \ni could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting . \nchristopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan . \nhe meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . \napparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . \nsince lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die . \nlet's stop and think about this for a second . \nif lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . \nin this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . \ni imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . \nyou know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . \nthis is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems . \nlambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . \nthey are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . \nthe script doesn't know what the hell to do with them . \nlone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . \nthe only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . \nin the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . \nwhat's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . \nalso , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany . \nthere is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot . \nby the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . \nwe're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! \nsomeone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . \nthis movie bungles two out of three , badly . \n""",0
"b'there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . \nof course , his best film was 1978\'s masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980\'s "" the fog , "" and 1987\'s underrated , "" prince of darkness . "" \nheck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness . "" \nbut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man . "" \nsomehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , "" village of the damned , "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , "" escape from l . a . "" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter\'s vampires . "" \nif i was him , i definately wouldn\'t want to put my own name in the title . \nit is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . "" \nthe story is simple . \njack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \nsince katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . \nit seems valek\'s mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . \nmy question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? \nwell , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . \n "" john carpenter\'s vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i\'ve ever seen . \nin fact , there isn\'t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . \nthe non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter\'s . \nand then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . \nthere is no story development , and there isn\'t even an attempt to flesh out the characters . \njames woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue . \ndaniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . \nand sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . \nthere is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter\'s vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter\'s . \nhe has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn\'t work up any excitement for it . \nand yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . \ni think that\'s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . \n'",0
"b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\'s independence day is here ! \nit\'s title : starship troopers . \nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \ni realize that i gave last year\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the \'star wars\' of the 90s . "" \nam i being to generous to this film ? \nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens\'-asses "" style . \nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \nthis new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \nand they should be . \ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \nthis is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average . \nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads . \nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \nstating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , \nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \nhowever , carmen isn\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \nunfortunately , rico isn\'t interested in dizzy . \nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects . \nan hour into the film , the war begins . \na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\' attacks . \na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \nthe troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it . \ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \nit\'s about special effects and gory violence . \ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\'s event horizon . \nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \nmy guess is that verhoeven\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \njake busey , gary busey\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \nhowever , he does give a good performance . \nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \nhis performance rises above the rest . \nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\'s presence on screen . \nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \nwe aren\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \ni haven\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \noh , and the special effects are first rate . \nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \nbelieve me when i say this : don\'t take young kids to see this film . \nit is extremely violent . \nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \nit\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \nnow that would be entertaining ! \n'",1
"b'if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . \nscripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch . \nit starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store . \nbecause this is a tarantino movie , however , it\'s not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it\'s a case of a hole being shot through someone\'s hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away . \nthe opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems . \nclooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it . \nharvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly . \nyou know you\'re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she\'s not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn . \nthe first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney\'s strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet . \nit does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino . \nonce they get to mexico , it\'s time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we\'re once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper . \nfinally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire . \nsoon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back . \nthat\'s right , we\'ve come all this way to see a vampire movie . \nbut like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment . \nso we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes "" a lap dog of satan . "" \nthe from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they\'re entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest . \nclooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously . \nstuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there\'s absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn . \npulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment . \nfrom dusk till dawn isn\'t the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie . \n'",1
"b'for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . \nif the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . \nthat extra motive doesn\'t make happy gilmore a funnier movie . \nit doesn\'t really add any genuine emotional depth , either . \nin fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . \nbut sandler\'s philosophy seems to be , if it\'s a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? \nthat is endlessly refreshing . \nin the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . \nthe fact that he\'s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . \nwhat kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . \ndavid spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . \nhe could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . \nbut sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . \nhe seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . \nrobbie hart ( sandler ) doesn\'t just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . \nhe is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . \nthe day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . \nrobbie takes it hard . \nhe doesn\'t sleep , he doesn\'t eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding . \njulia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . \neventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . \nhe really likes her , but she\'s engaged . \nher fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn\'t deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . \njulia seems to like robbie too , but she can\'t leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . \nyou know the story . \nyou\'ve seen it a million times before . \nthere\'s always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it\'s the same story . \nand sometimes , it works . \nthe wedding singer works . \nfirst of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . \nactually , it\'s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one\'s own romantic tension . \nsandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . \nbarrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . \nsparks don\'t fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other . \nsecond , their love is mature . \nthey are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they\'re a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . \ninstead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . \nat a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . \nthe repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . \nthe ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . \nother critics liked this movie in part because of the \'80s soundtrack . \ni liked it in spite of the soundtrack . \noften , the music and references felt forced . \nfor example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to "" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up .

"b'robert altman\'s cookie\'s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \nwe also fleetingly see emma\'s lover jason ( chris o\'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \nshe exclaims "" here i come !

the fresher , the better . \nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \'s hardcore film scene . \nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \nby the film\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \nboogie nights is not about sex . \nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \nin fact , the film isn\'t really about pornography at all . \npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name "" dirk diggler "" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \ni say "" former "" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \nhe pulls it off marvelously . \nwahlberg is a "" big , bright star "" with a big bright future . \nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \nwahlberg\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\'s . \nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \nknow , kinda like disco . \n'",1

"b""all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \ni loved the young cast in this movie . \nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \nbut i never used baked goods . ' \nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' \nand so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . \nin it's own way . \n""",1

"b'it\'s time to take cover . \nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante\'s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \nof the two , i had heard that dante\'s peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \nsymbolism doesn\'t get much more blatant than that . \nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \nharry survived , but his wife did not . \na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante\'s peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante\'s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \nalthough the mayor doesn\'t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \nthey are afraid that harry\'s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante\'s peak . \nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \nthis film contains a number of cliches . \nthe amorous couple is one . \nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they\'re going to die . \nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \nfor example , harry\'s boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry\'s eruption predictions aren\'t cause for alarm . \nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town\'s in trouble and i\'m the best man you\'ve got . "" \neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won\'t move and will allow itself to be cooked . \n "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "" \nasks one of the team members . \n "" it\'s my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry . \ndante\'s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , "" acid eats metal . "" \nthanks for the tip . \nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there\'s a caption labeling it as such . \nthis wouldn\'t have been so bad if it weren\'t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , "" u . s . geological survey . "" \ni suppose the caption is for people who can\'t read signs . \nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , "" why do they want to kiss ? \nwere they even attracted to each other ? "" \nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn\'t even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \nwho does he think he is ? \njames bond ? \nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \nthere are several "" warning signs "" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don\'t feel as if they are leading up to anything . \nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \na tremor occurs . \ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \nit wasn\'t . \none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante\'s peak . \nin a disaster movie , there\'s usually one guy who\'s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \nit\'s okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \nif you\'re going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \nin dante\'s peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don\'t really try hard enough . \nmaybe the mayor\'s abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \nthe first is the scenery . \nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \nthe second is the special effects . \nthey are the closest i\'ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \nbut when elements which don\'t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you\'d probably better rewrite the script . \n'",0

"b'this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i\'ve had for a while . \nwith this film , plus `showgirls\' and `basic instinct\' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . \nhis celebrated film `total recall\' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . \nobviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship\' seemed fake . \nbut not everything bad in the film was the director\'s fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . \nit is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . \ncasserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . \nno , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . \nwhile `total\' was written well , `starship\' is purely pathetic . \nall right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you\'re supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . \nas a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . \nhalf of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210\' ( dina meyer was in "" beverly hills "" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . \nthe battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . \nthere weren\'t even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . \ni wonder what the insects eat , if there\'s nothing but them on the planets ? \nthere is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . \nthis type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can\'t see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . \nbut then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . \nthe pointless plot begins when johnny\'s ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . \njohnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . \nbut there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn\'t better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . \nand the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . \nanyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . \ndizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . \nthey then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . \nand guess what ? \nthat\'s about as complex as it gets . \noh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . \nhe\'s my fifth nom for a razzie . \nthe troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . \nnaturally , they win , or sort of half-win . \nof course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . \nthe bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? \nisn\'t it also amazing that earthlings haven\'t invented better hand-held weapons by then ? \nthe only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . \nwell , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu\' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . \n'",0

"b'synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a "" phantom "" menace . \njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala\'s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \ncan they free amidala\'s helpless planet ? \nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace\'s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \ndirector george lucas answers , "" it\'s only a movie .

"b'catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . \nshe has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy\'s parents aren\'t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . \nas if trying to assure the boy\'s parents wasn\'t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane\'s mental faculties . \na vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d\'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . \njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . \nthe police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim\'s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . \nin a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher\'s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . \na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! \ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \'s "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \nin my opinion , d\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \na sequence where catherine enters stargher\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \n'",1

"" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . "" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . "" \nthe plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . "" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" \nthere\'s even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that "" they\'re parodying that \'blair witch\' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , "" chicken run "" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug\'s life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n'",1
"b' "" there will be another , "" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994\'s the crow , anyway . \nthe idea of spinning artist james o\'barr\'s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \nof course , it doesn\'t . \nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee\'s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \nit\'s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist\'s delight -- but it\'s also horrifying and fascinating . \ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \nthere\'s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won\'t be much of a success . \nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \n ( i\'ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \nperez might have some screen presence if he\'s given something to do with himself , but here he\'s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \nat first , he\'s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \nhe\'s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \ntattooed with angels\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \nlike all good things here , he\'s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \nin the meantime , we\'re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah\'s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren\'t distinctly secondhand . \neven the soundtrack is tired . \nmore than anything i\'ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it\'s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn\'t that bad per se . \nhe\'s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \nhis major stylistic failing is that he can\'t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn\'t , the performers who couldn\'t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \nwho bought david s . goyer\'s anemic script , anyway ? \nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \n'",0
"b'synopsis : original "" jurassic park "" survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son . \ngrant\'s team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought . \nreview : there is one reason why "" jurassic park iii "" is better than its immediate predecessor , "" the lost world : jurassic park "" . \nthe latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94 . \nthe first "" park "" was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills . \nits two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies . \nat least this third entry realises it ; whereas "" the lost world "" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , "" jurassic park iii "" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin . \nthere is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation . \nremember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ? \nnothing in this rehash even comes close . \nadd in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman , payne and taylor , and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni , and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts . \nat least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character , and there is much less gore than in "" the lost world "" , making this installment more suitable for children . \n'",0
"b""upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . \ni'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen . \nyet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters . \ndirector pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters . \nthe family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family . \nthere is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . \nsquabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history . \nperhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness . \nno situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems . \nthis probably is a result of the film being from a stage play . \nthe play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright . \nwhat seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa . \nin fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness . \nlegs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster . \nonly after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble . \nin the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter . \nthe movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite . \nhe trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance . \ndrawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous . \nthe mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change . \nas michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever . \nthe movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women . \nnote : this is the first movie review i've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated . \n : ) \n""",1
"b'us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren\'t thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions . \nif the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . \nthe film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer\'s kids . \ndoc tells marty he must take his son\'s place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . \nwhoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn\'t joking , especially when it comes to the movies . \nessentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it\'s not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . \nat the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything\'s copasetic right ? \nwrong . \nsince when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ? \nthere are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won\'t even bother to list them all . \nbasically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . \nthe films\' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . \nit\'s difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . \nthe only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . \ninstead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . \nby the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn\'t seem gratuitous . \n "" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie . \nit certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . \n'",1
"b' "" alcohol and drugs = bad . \nnot alcohol and drugs = good . \ngot it ? "" \njust when you though you\'ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those \'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself\' . . \n\'28 days\' is practically a visualization of the usual \'meaningful\' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . \ngwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . \nfor her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . \nthis behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . \nher existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . \nsuch as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister\'s ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone\'s house . \nthis time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . \nhere she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . \nmost important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . \nthe film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . \nit is a classic cautionary tale . \nan echo . \na big , fat and expensive clich ? . \na shadow of last year\'s \'girl , interrupted\' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like \'the cuckoo\'s nest\' and \'trainspotting\' . \ndirector betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . \nfor some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . \njokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . \nand what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . \nisn\'t that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? \neven the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas\' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . \nit is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . \nbut the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . \nthat it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . \n "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . \nand that\'s how simple it is ! \nin fact i would rather watch \'lost in space\' once again , than return to \'28 days\' . \nas for acting , it\'s acceptable , but hardly anything else . \nfor sandra bullock it\'s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than \'speed\' . \nshe handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . \ndominic west shines as the source of gwenie\'s devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins\' and steve buscemi\'s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . \nalthough intellectually \'girl , interrupted\' was a greater achievement , \'28 days\' is superior in its visual aspect . \nthere are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . \nthe most important thing is that we\'ve seen it before and it was a lot better . \n\'clean and sober\' , \'only when i laugh\' , \'when a man loves a woman\' , \'leaving las vegas\' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . \nso what\'s the point ? \nin other words \'28 days\' doesn\'t contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . \nif you\'re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you\'re standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch \'28 days\' . \nunder all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost . \n'",0
"b'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" . \nthen it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly "" . \nthen , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s "" the pines of rome "" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s "" rhapsody in blue "" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s "" the steadfast tin soldier "" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer\'s apprentice "" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\'s "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \ndonald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\'t make it on the boat . \nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \npowerful stuff . \nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last "" . \nset to igor stravinsky\'s "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\'s clip is pretty funny . \nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\'s "" ride of the valkyries "" , and a strange segment prepared in the \'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \n[g] \n'",1

"b'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \n "" 54 "" belongs in the elite group of films known as "" the big disappointments "" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \ni was heavily awaiting "" 54 , "" not the least because i\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this "" edgy "" film . \nperhaps more importantly , "" 54 "" is part of the blossoming subgenre , "" the 70s nostalgia film , "" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with "" boogie nights "" and "" the last days of disco "" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from "" boogie nights , "" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from "" the last days of disco , "" not to mention several others . \n "" 54 "" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \nthis is a definite plus . \nhere\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\'s look at how it all affected the people . \nbut this film doesn\'t let that happen . \nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , who\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \nhe\'s dim-witted , into being part of "" the scene , "" and soon finds he\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \nbit like "" saturday night fever , "" \'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from "" clueless "" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \nthe film\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \nit\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \nthe studio\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\'s "" la dolce vita "" ) , and when i watched "" 54 , "" i didn\'t particularly want to stay . \n'",0
"b'okay , bear with me y\'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : \nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? \nwhew . okay . \ncause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe . \neven i know that you need more footage than * that * . \nand that wasn\'t the only thing getting on my nerves . \nthe cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . \nat first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . \nit is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn\'t * die . \na ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i\'m willing to accept it because i\'m willing to accept that this is how amanda\'s life is changed , how her powers are received . \nlater on , the movie can\'t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . \nand this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren\'t just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary . \nthe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good . \nsome places the plot just doesn\'t make sense , sometimes it\'s way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice . \ncan\'t beat that ) . \nall in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected . \nnot romantic at all , and only funny in some places . \nso , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? \nor the fairy godfather ? \nshe can * float * now too ? \nand all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? \ntom all of a sudden just accepts amanda\'s "" witchcraft "" in the end ? \nwould people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac\'s video ? \nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? \nit is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome . \nthe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . \nthe humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . \ngellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming "" cruel intentions "" ) than this sorry excuse for a character . \nit\'s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . \nthe supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in "" you\'ve got mail "" ( see footnotes ) . \nand , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there\'s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . \nthis sort of got on the nerves after a while , too . \n "" simply irresistible "" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can\'t draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick . \nand how could i refrain from making a pun ? \n . \n . \n . \n "" simply irresistible "" is all too easy to resist . \n ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) \n * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to "" you\'ve got mail "" ( or "" the shop around the corner "" ) ? \nbusiness rivals fall in love . \nfemale counterpart\'s business is in danger of being shut down . \nfemale as mother- like figure guiding her . \nthe annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . \n * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar\'s wardrobe . \n'",0
"b'on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . \nhe says to a black congregation "" . . . if you can\'t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you\'re never gonna get rid of me . "" ) \nwell , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . \nbeatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . \nthe movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth\'s latest commercials condemning affirmative action . \nthe montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . \nwhen we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . \nhis campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . \nfirst he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter\'s name . \nthen he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . \nhis assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth\'s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . \nbulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . \nhe is hit hard with questions about his voting record . \nhe had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn\'t shown up . \nsince he\'s a dead man anyway , he figures he\'ll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . \nthey made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . \nthe shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . \n ( before i go further , i\'d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . \nfans is not part of bulworth\'s "" truth . "" \nthat line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . \nwhen the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they\'re talking about . ) \nthe experience is liberating . \nwith nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . \nhe can say whatever he wants because he\'s going to be dead anyway . \nwhy not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? \nbulworth\'s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can\'t hollywood make a quality product . \n ( you go , warren ! ) \nwhen they become indignant and ask why he\'s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it\'s because they are rich jews . \nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \nhe\'s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he\'s not embarrassingly bad . \nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \neventually , the movie\'s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \nit\'s too bad that there aren\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \njust don\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \n'",1

"b'teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . \nevery year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . \nthe formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . \nyou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . \nthe response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . \nthat is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . \njosie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . \nshe has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . \nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life . \nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . \nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . \nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . \nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . \nhowever , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . \nobviously , the field assignment involves a high school . \nspecifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them .

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nduring the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . \noh , he\'s been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . \nit\'s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino\'s new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . \nthings aren\'t going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . \nshe\'s 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren\'t worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she\'s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . \nthe loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he\'s soon out to silence jackie brown . \nmeanwhile , the authorities\' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . \nonly through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . \nalthough jackie brown marks mr . tarantino\'s first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there\'s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . \nwhile he\'s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character\'s now black . \nin terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . \nthe opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . \nthe timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . \nof course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it\'s perhaps the most tender scene of the year . \ntenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? \nsure , there\'ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino\'s films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . \nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what\'s new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . \nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he\'s the real deal . \nthis new aspect of mr . tarantino\'s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . \nmr . forster\'s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . \nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta\'s then-sagging career . \nas it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film\'s title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . \ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she\'s been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton\'s mars attacks ! \nand larry cohen\'s original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) \nof course , it\'s true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . \nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . \nand while the film\'s narrative doesn\'t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it\'s filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn\'t an unengaging moment . \nwith an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it\'ll be interesting to see what he tries next . \n'",1
"b'the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor\'s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989\'s dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \nwilliams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \nwe\'re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \nit\'s at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia\'s medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch\'s appearance before the state medical board . \nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there\'s little story to be told outside of patch\'s skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch\'s zest for humanity . \nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it\'s easy to see why . \nmonica potter plays patch\'s love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \nfor some reason he\'s attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \nthe script -- based on hunter adams\' own story -- works well this way . \nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch\'s life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams\' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \npatch adams\' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there\'s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \nnevertheless , it\'s an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn\'t try in the first place . \nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it\'s entertainment for the entire family . \n'",1

"b""`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . \nto pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . \nsomething like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . \nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror . \njudging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . \nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably . \ndone right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . \nunfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . \nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . \ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward . \nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . \nthese bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . \nboy , are these bats ugly . \nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . \nthey've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . \na whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . \nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do . \nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . \nbut no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . \nthe film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . \non the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . \nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . \neven the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . \nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . \nthe scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' . \nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . \nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' . \neverything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . \nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . \nin fact , that may have worked out better in the end . \ntake one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . \nunfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . \nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . \nmccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . \nthe entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . \nsomething like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? \ni just want my money . ' \nthe bats are ugly , i must say . \nthere's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . \nonly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery . \ncharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . \nlet's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? \nyou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . \nthis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' . \n""",0
"b'it\'s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . \nthe movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . \nosmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there\'s something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . \nnot that there\'s anything wrong with scatology . \ni bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . \nit\'s merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . \nyou can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . \nosmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . \nthe trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . \nadults ? well , let\'s just say most will find it unappetizing . \nosmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . \nthe live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . \nhe continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . \nfrank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . \nhe works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . \nfrank\'s body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . \nit\'s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . \nnope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate\'s mouth . \nlike i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . \nafter ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . \nhere , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier\'s david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . \nbasically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . \nand this is why osmosis jones doesn\'t click . \nit merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . \nthe jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . \nafter pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn\'t look fluish .

"b""it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . \nmcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . \nfright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . \nthis is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . \nwilliam ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . \n ( at least in the movies anyway . ) \nit has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . \ncharlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . \napparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . \nso she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . \nthis ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . \none of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . \nfright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . \nwhile they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . \nwith the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . \none bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . \nit's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . \nragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . \nroddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . \ni guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . \nthe original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . \nnever a good thing for a horror film . \nanother minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . \nfor that matter , they were almost nonexistent . \nif i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . \nthe first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . \nif i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . \neither way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation . \n""",0
"b""synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall . \ncomments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it . \nstrike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) . \nstrike two came while the previews played . \ndid you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? \nwell , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) . \ntracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout . \nabout the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery . \nto be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller . \nwolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title . \njames brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten . \nbrolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company . \nby the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious . \napparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city . \nbut , then again , what do i know about business ? \ni do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch . \nlarson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill . \nthis leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it . \nthe film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game . \nlarson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . \nsome old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . \nthe old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two . \noutside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . \nif you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't . \nmake tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery . \n""",0

"b'i\'m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \nwhen tim burton\'s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it\'s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \nand when it doesn\'t work , it\'s just dull . \ni\'m not even sure it works more often than it doesn\'t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \nis brilliant . \nmars attacks ! \nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \nit\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \nit\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\'s "" kennedy room , "" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , "" they blew up congress ! "" \nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \njim brown and tom jones are the film\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\'s everyone says i love you ) . \nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\'re fantastic . \nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\'s little monsters are more inventive . \nthe film\'s raison d\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\'s earned . \nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \nwas in production long before that film\'s release . \ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \ncronenberg\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \nthis is not a nice movie . \n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \nby setting the film\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \n'",1
"b'chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . \ni think i fall into the former category ( i\'m one of the few who thought his turn in "" the fifth element "" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle "" money talks "" just doesn\'t do him service . \ntucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he\'s also really the only thing good about the movie . \nin fact , if you see "" money talks , "" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of "" toy story "" \'s writers penned the sloppy script . \ntucker\'s role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . \nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . \nbut villard\'s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . \nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . \nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . \nthis means james must present his new "" friend "" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . \nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \n "" this ain\'t no buddy movie , "" claim the print ads . \nyeah , right . \nactually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears "" money talks "" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . \nthis is tucker\'s first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . \nbut you realize all too quickly that tucker\'s overstated liveliness is the only thing "" money talks "" has going for it . \nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . \nit\'s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with "" money talks .

"" ) \nis extremely silly . \nyou get the picture . \nobviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at "" money talks . "" \nbut the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . \nbut tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie\'s best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone\'s son at james and grace\'s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . \ntucker\'s audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like "" money talks .

"b""steve martin shines but sgt . bilko \nfails to impress \nbased on the popular 50's sitcom , sgt . \nbilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . \nremember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? \n ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . \ni do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success . \nsuch movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie . \nsgt . \nbilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain . \nsgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter . \nthough totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools . \nthough materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that . \ncolonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it . \nbilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds . \nto add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days . \ndirector jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt . \nbilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it . \nthere are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt . \nbilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer . \nstill , steve martin's sgt . \nbilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian . \nwithout him , sgt . \nbilko would have just fell flat on its face . \nsgt . \nbilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world . \nthe current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity . \nunless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres . \ni'm sure there are better ones around . \n""",0
"b'you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they\'re as real as life . \ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person\'s brain with microwaves . \nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . \ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . \nthese people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \na little imagination goes a long way . \nin richard donner\'s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day\'s work for him . \nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \nwhat she doesn\'t know is that jerry\'s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry\'s ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice\'s help . \none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \npart of this is a result of the film\'s slow pace . \nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it\'s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we\'re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \nbig deal , we\'ve seen it all before . \nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \nthe two just don\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \neven gibson\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \nunfortunately , much of what\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\'s never followed through . \nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\'s lungs for chlorine . \nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \nyou know what happens then ? \nnothing , zip , nada . \nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\'s the significance ? \nokay , here\'s another one . \na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye "" . \njerry also has a bunch of copies . \nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \nthat\'s about it . \nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \nokay , here\'s my theory . \nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \n'",0
"b'fritz lang\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\'t save up enough money to marry her . \nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \nbut the deputy sheriff "" buggs "" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\'t get through to the prisoner\'s jail cell . \nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \nkatherine , not knowing he\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \nthe defense claims that it can\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\'t have been at the jail . \nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\'t identify anyone in the mob . \nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \nbut don\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \nmgm couldn\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \nto lang\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \nyou couldn\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\'t going to be convicted . \nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \n'",1
"b'moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you\'ve got to know how to allocate your resources . \nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \nin the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn\'t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn\'t have anybody to block for him . \nalmost every cent that\'s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \n ( chan\'s first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \nheck , jackie doesn\'t even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \nin condor , chan plays the same character he\'s always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms . \nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he\'s more pathetic than evil . \nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film\'s centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that\'s even better than the one in face/off . \nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain\'s legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn\'t he take the key with him ? ) . \ndon\'t worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \njust go see the movie . \noperation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \nhowever , you\'ve got to go with what you\'ve got , and what you\'ve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \n'",1

"b'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \nthe film\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \n * * * the review * * * \nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \nthe screenplay was lynch\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \nlynch\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\'s two main strands . \none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \nthe thinking among universal\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \nwith lynch\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \nwhat a great idea ! \nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\'t care much for them . \nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \ndune is also a very serous film . \nthe constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\' star wars trilogy . \nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \nit still possesses enough of lynch\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \nthe conclusion ? \nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director\'s cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth "" . \ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\'s handiwork there\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\'s storyline . \npaul\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \npaul\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \nthere\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\'t even in herbert\'s book . \nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug "" . \nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the "" alan smithee "" version remains the closest we\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \nstill , as one of this century\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \n'",0
"b""tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . \nrobbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . \nhe goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . \nthere , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . \nthere , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . \nof course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . \nalthough the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . \nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . \nit's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . \neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . \nthere also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . \nin planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . \nin nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . \ntowards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , \nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . \nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . \nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . \nhowever , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . \nin fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . \nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . \nthe humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . \nthe characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' \nnothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . \nhe nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . \n""",0
"b'the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . \nif you haven\'t already figured it out , i didn\'t like this movie very much . \nthe plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . \ntarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . \nhe is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . \nback in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . \n ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) \nanyway , tarzan\'s old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . \ntarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . \nhe leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . \nof course , jane is hot on her ape man\'s heals . \nthe two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . \nsound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? \nit\'s actually an improvement over the real thing . \nthe acting is just plain awful . \ni\'m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn\'t acting . \njane march wasn\'t a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes . \ncompounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i\'ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . \nadded to the sound problems was the cinematography . \nthis film was filled with beautiful african scenery . \nbut the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me . \nquite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . \nthen we have the special effects . \n "" special effects in a tarzan movie ? "" \nyou are no doubt asking yourself ? \nyes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story . \nprobably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story . \nin most parts , they weren\'t bad , just nothing special . \nbut , they were more than a little on the hokey side . \nexcept of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie . \nthe grand finale\'s special effects went right into the toilet at that point . \nit almost looked like they had run out of money . \nthese effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production . \ni took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don\'t mix . \nstay far away from this version of tarzan . \n'",0
"b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \ni suppose i\'m not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\'s early works . \nin fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\'s wing for years and years , i\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \nin fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \nthe film seems to not only borrow it\'s plot from last year\'s similarly-fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \'80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter\'s twisted remake of "" the thing . "" \n "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \nthey get on . \nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \nand it\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\'t give a damn . \ni almost don\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \nlike anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo \'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \nor peter o\'toole in "" caligula .

"b'working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \nthe problem is , of course , that there aren\'t many good roles available for black women . \ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve\'s bayou , and all that\'s left is a chance to be someone\'s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \nas a result , for pinkett smith\'s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith\'s woo and tommy davidson\'s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren\'t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment . \nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she\'s about to meet mr . right , and that he\'ll be a virgo . \nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \nit\'s not love at first sight , however . \nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner . \nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad "" white "" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it\'s only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber . \nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there\'s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \nsadly , that\'s one of the film\'s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there\'s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson\'s script . \nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \n'",0
"b'one-sided "" doom and gloom "" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . \norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . \nthe film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the "" future "" never do . \nfor example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . \nwe\'re still here . \nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . \nwe\'re still here . \nsome of the more ludicrous moments come when it\'s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . \nalso , there\'s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . \nif it\'s anything like it\'s depicted as here then it\'s going to be incredibly boring . \nthe late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . \nit contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . \nalso included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . \naudio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . \ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . \ncertainly i never expected a remastered print . \ncuriously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . \nbut they\'re menu screens . . . \nso who really cares ? \n[pg] \n'",0
"b' ( dimension films , "" scream 2 "" \'s distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film\'s twisty plot . \nthat\'s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there\'s a first ) . ) \n "" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , "" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter\'s wes craven thriller "" scream , "" her statement referring to the films of the "" nightmare on elm street "" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . \nthe comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . \nbut like it or not , along comes "" scream 2 . "" and believe it or not , it\'s a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood\'s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . \n "" scream 2 "" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . \nit\'s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . \nthose surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . \nplucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . \ntrash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called "" stab .

"" \npinkett yells at the screen . ) \nit\'s funny , creepy stuff ( i don\'t think i\'ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . \nanother flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . \nthere are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . \nthere are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . \nit\'s something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . \nit can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . \nit certainly doesn\'t skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson\'s judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . \nsometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we\'re shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects , "" "" aliens "" and "" the empire strikes back .

"b""best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \nit's too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n""",0
"b'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go "" somewhere "" . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell , i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the "" sand-twister "" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \ndid i say "" admire "" , i meant "" am disgusted "" ! \nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n'",0
"b'you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . \nthey\'re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . \ncombine that with howie long\'s first starring action role , and you\'ve got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn\'t a very good film . \nhowie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . \nin the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire . \nwilliam forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . \nhe ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . \nhis escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him . \nsoon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters . \nwhy canadian ? \nwho knows , eh ? \nalong the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage . \nenter howie long . \nhe\'s called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help . \nwhen he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . \nlong\'s acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much . \nalthough his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he\'s a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better . \nthe script doesn\'t help him out any , however . \nall too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny . \nthe dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable . \nlong\'s co-stars are a mixed bag . \nat least they\'re all comfortable in their respective roles . \nforsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn\'t seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . \nsuzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn\'t given much more to do . \nsome of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland . \nyou\'d think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . \nthat\'s not the case . \nthere\'s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we\'ve \nseen this stuff before . \nit\'s not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996\'s debut , bio-dome ) . \nhowever , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were . \nin fact , there\'s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . . \n'",0
"b'there was a lot riding on this movie . \neveryone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end . \nwhat would be the "" final act "" ? \nthis is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . \nno need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co . \nso , how does the story go ? \nas opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems . \nshe works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone . \nbut that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off . \ninstead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him . \nthe rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two . \nnot only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . \nat the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional . \nnevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene . \nso , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ?

"b""as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . \nhe is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . \nand , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . \nin the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . \nhis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . \nhe is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . \nlomax is soon given the case of his life . \nhe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . \nthe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . \nhe works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . \nbut what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . \nit begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . \nbut milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . \nquite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . \nfreaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . \nthe movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . \nthe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . \nthe second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . \nunfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . \ngranted , the film is very handsome-looking . \nyou'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . \nyou'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . \nyou'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . \nthis was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . \nas with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . \nin the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . \nhis path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . \nhis actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . \npacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . \nthere is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . \nthe focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . \nthis movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . \nhowever , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all . \n""",0
"b'200 cigarettes takes place on new year\'s eve 1981 . \nmonica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year\'s party . \neveryone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things . \nthis is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes . \nas we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all . \nthis disappointed me greatly . \nthe film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion . \nlucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd . \nthe two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that . \nthis subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that . \njaneane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin . \nshe plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin\'s . \nthis subplot is completely a waste of garofalo\'s talent . \nthere was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie . \nwhen lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed . \nthe bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica\'s party . \nat the bar , he runs into two more girls . \nthe girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don\'t even remember their characters names . \nben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn\'t go anywhere so he doesn\'t have much screen time to give a good performance . \nfeatherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad . \nchristina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie . \nthe two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost . \nthey meet some guys and end up going around with them all night . \nthis subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie\'s accent . \nhoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good . \nshe was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress . \nanother subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn\'s daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr . \njack is an actor who doesn\'t care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn\'t . \nkate hudson is a huge klutz . \nshe gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie . \nthey are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well . \nthis subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson\'s performance . \nmohr wasn\'t good , but he wasn\'t bad . \nhe was just alright , which i didn\'t find acceptable . \nthere is not much to say about the performances in the film . \nnone of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not . \nthe only performances that i can judge are christina ricci\'s as always good performance , kate hudson\'s funny role , courtney love\'s mediocre performance , and paul rudd\'s annoying and overused performance . \ni was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo . \nthe two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes . \nmartha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 . \nthe soundtrack is full of 1980\'s tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love . "" \nthe songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s . \nduring the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ? \nis there any moral story ? \nis there a point ? \nare any of the events going on in the film necessary ? \ndo i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? "" \nthe movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over . \nthe plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible . \nmaybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better . \nthe bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many . \n'",0
"b'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\'s past patients . \ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \ncut to the "" next fall "" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has "" the sixth sense "" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of "" siskel and ebert "" ) . \nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \nit\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \nand when the final moments do come , it\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \ni won\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few "" twilight zone "" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \ni wouldn\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught "" dateline nbc "" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \n'",0
"b'the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? "" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\'t , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\'s films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\'s best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer\'s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer\'s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart\'s of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \nthe story of us is one of 1999\'s most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film\'s major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like "" it\'s over , "" or "" i hate you , "" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an "" us . "" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \n'",1
"b""taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \nalthough qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \nthere's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \nholmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . \nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . \nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . \nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . \nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nerm , go to go , i guess . \n""",1

"b""one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \nbefore she is abducted . \ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the

\nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \npart of the blame falls on david klass . \ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \nthanks to

language , and suggested sex . \nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \ni must also say that i loved the ending . \nthe

"b'warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe . "" \nif you haven\'t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . \nnutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . \nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \n-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn\'t have a winning side and a losing side . \nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \nthis is the theme of sidney lumet\'s "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \n "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \na great deal of "" fail-safe "" \'s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia\'s borders--at any cost . \nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \nthe events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they\'re anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states\' role in all of it . \nmost of this is through the film\'s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president\'s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \nmany of the film\'s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties . \n "" what\'s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" \na guest asks impatiently . \n "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele\'s "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\'s merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele\'s own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear "" incident "" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\'herlihy\'s character as the symbolic "" matador "" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n "" fail-safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet\'s direction and walter bernstein\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\'s and wheeler\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail-safe "" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n'",1
"b'i cried during _babe_ . \ni admit it . \nthe special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children\'s film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . \nsuch , my friend , is the power of cinema . \nwhen word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . \nthey can\'t possibly drop the ball on this one . \ncan\'t miss . \ncan\'t possibly miss . \nthey missed . \nwhat went wrong ? \nafter much thought , i supply three general rules . \n ( 1 ) don\'t let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall\'s dreadful "" preacher\'s wife "" ) . \nbetty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn\'t quite work here . \nit\'s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . \ntake away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80\'s kirk cameron show . \n ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , \n "" con air "" ) . \nit is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . \nit\'s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don\'t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . \nnow there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he\'s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . \nnorm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . \nbut there\'s little humor here . \nthat rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . \neven the mouth is ill-synched . \n ( 3 ) don\'t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . \nthere\'s a certain timing that\'s mandatory in comedy . \nto have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson\'s creature shop , is a travesty . \nthis is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren\'t well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . \nhere , betty thomas is clearly over her head . \ni wish i could commend the special effects , but they\'re merely average . \ncount the number of times where the animal\'s mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . \nthis is less a "" babe "" and more of a "" look who\'s barking "" clone . \nyou may be wondering , \'how does eddie murphy fare ? \' \nwell , he came back with the exceptional "" nutty professor "" , and i don\'t doubt he can come back again . \nhere , he\'s tied into a straight man and given little to do . \nthe exceptions are when he fears he\'s going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you\'d expect routine that he\'s more adept at . \nit\'s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . \nafter all this , what\'s left ? \nbutt jokes . \na _lot_ of butt jokes . \ni guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . \nif there\'s a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . \n'",0
"b'the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that\'s the problem . \nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \n "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \nit\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \nit wasn\'t always this way . \ntim burton\'s "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \n "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\'s tale of darkness . \nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \n "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\'s often difficult to tell who\'s whacking who . \nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \n "" batman and robin "" doesn\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \nit\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \nironically , the parts of "" batman and robin "" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \neasily the best batman yet , clooney\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\'t even hint at . \nthe film\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\'s butler and surrogate father . \nas for the other heroes , chris o\'donnell\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\'s where "" batman and robin "" really suffers . \nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \nthurman fails to maintain the character\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \nthe biggest lesson to be learned from "" batman and robin "" is that more is not better . \njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \ni don\'t think so . \nmy prescription ? \nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist\'s convention so he\'ll understand that there\'s no hard feelings ) . \ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o\'donnell and michael gough . \ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the "" event "" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \n'",0
"b' "" six days , seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \nhere\'s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it\'s fluff , recognizes it\'s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie\'s success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it\'s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \nthe age difference ( ford\'s 56 , heche\'s 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that\'s hard to come by . \nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn\'s shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \nat a slim 101 minutes , "" six days , seven nights "" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \nmichael browning\'s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is "" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? "" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they\'re all quite engaging . \neven the movie\'s more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink . \nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days , seven nights "" \' heterosexual pairing . \n ( so she\'s a lesbian . \nso what . \ndeal with it . ) \nof course it doesn\'t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \nafter several wrong guesses ( "" forty-five ? \n_fifty_ ?

"b'steve soderbergh\'s "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films . \nmade on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . \nthe film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20\'s-early 30\'s . \nann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . \ncomplicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john\'s old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . \nann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . \nthat is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . \ndirector steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998\'s "" out of sight "" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997\'s "" schizopolis "" ) . \nhe is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . \nthe performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . \nshe is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman\'s 1993 mosaic , "" short cuts "" ) . \nthe other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader\'s ominous graham , to gallagher\'s self-involved john , to giacomo\'s outspoken cynthia . \nthe final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film\'s secrets . \nsuffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . \nthe film has one fault , however . \nthe characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . \nif there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn\'t quite as explored as i would have liked . \n "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . \nsoderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . \n'",1
"b""once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \n""",1

"b'when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . \nit really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . \nbut weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . \naustin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i\'ve had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . \nif all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? \n-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . \neven more to this movie\'s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . \nthe original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . \nall of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . \nironically , powers\' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah !

"b""seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . \n[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] \n ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . \ni'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? \nnever mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . \nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \nnever mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . \nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . \nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \nsecond trilogy . . . \nwell you know what i mean ) . \nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \n[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \ncritic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' \nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \nbut i digress . \ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \n""",1

"b'the summer of 00\' wasn\'t a very good one for devout cinephiles . \nit offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . \nnurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o\' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : "" quality "" films ) compete for audiences . \nalas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . \nit\'s also indie director neil labute\'s first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i\'m sad to report it\'s a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that\'s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute\'s previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . \ni went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it\'s screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . \nare critics so desperate for something unique that they\'re blind to how derivative the particular brand of "" uniqueness "" betty dolls out is ? \nfor the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . \nbetty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . \nit\'s labute\'s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn\'t even seem to have half that heart in it . \nnurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . \nshe happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . \nshe\'s blocked out her husband\'s death and thinks she\'s a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . \nbetty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . \nthe labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . \nthe play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute\'s persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "" average "" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . \nin the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim "" boys will be boys "" . \nanother character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! \nwhat was once so powerful about labute\'s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn\'t it . \nhe clearly has little passion for what he\'s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn\'t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that\'s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn\'t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it\'s like he\'s doing the damn chris rock show . \nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \nit\'s the best work she\'s ever done . \nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty\'s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \nthat\'s interesting but the movie doesn\'t do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie\'s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it\'s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \nbetty\'s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn\'t make any progress in the film . \nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim\'s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim\'s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don\'tcha think . \nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn\'t even seem aware of this . \nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the \'80s than the \'00s ) , the film simply uses betty\'s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \n'",0
"b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\'s dialogue or narrator\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\'s ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n'",1

"b'starship troopers is a bad movie . \ni mean , a really , really , bad movie . \nnot only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . \nlooking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . \nthat being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who\'s logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . \nthe film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . \nas the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another\'s hand . \neventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . \nas our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . \n "" what ?

"b'after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house . \nthe review \ntwo low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . \neach has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . \nif a film\'s box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two . \nwriter/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit . \nthe story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie\'s ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party . \nwhile the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom\'s head . \nthings begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses . \nwhere these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you . \ndavid koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom\'s house or just down the street . \nby keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) . \nunfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity . \nhumour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting . \nseveral tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes . \nalso , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away . \nkevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably . \nhis total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie . \nkathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most "" wife who can no longer handle her husband "" parts . \nwhile it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls "" a private club that i\'m not invited to "" , where they whisper about things all day long . \nas jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time . \nboth children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are . \nfans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes . \nit combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film . \nif only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year\'s best . \n'",1
"b'jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \nhowever zero\'s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \narlo is not happy with his job . \nhe is thrilled to be around zero\'s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \nand they\'re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend\'s boss means more to arlo than her . \nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \ngregory stark ( ryan o\'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \nzero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero\'s odd behavior . \nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \nhowever , there\'s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \nthat\'s not to say that there\'s not a place for humor in this film . \nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller\'s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren\'t funny enough to stand on their own . \nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero\'s brilliance really begins to shine . \nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock\'s own . \nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero\'s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \nzero\'s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria\'s character . \nshe\'s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero\'s zone of detachment . \nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \nbill pullman , when he\'s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \nthere\'s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called "" zero "" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \n'",1
"b' "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \nafter the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! \nthere is no goddamned blair witch !

"" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold .

"b'the caveman\'s valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green , based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons \n * * * for more film , dvd and books about movie reviews , plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival , visit _film freak central_ - http : //filmfreakcentral . net \n| now with search engine * * * \na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean\'s graphic novel "" arkham asylum "" , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a "" valentine "" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald\'s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\'s a nut , that doesn\'t mean that he can\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is a concept so "" high concept "" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\'s "" caveman "" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\'t inscribed with "" gotham pd . "" \nthat being said , _the caveman\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \nit , along with m . night shyamalan\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\'s seminal "" the dark knight returns "" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \nreaders of sam keith\'s brilliant "" the maxx "" comic series ( or of mtv\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \nthe failure of both "" the maxx "" tv show and of _the caveman\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \n_the caveman\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \n_the caveman\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\'s rat\'s alley wasteland . \n'",1
"b'i can imagine how good krippendorf\'s tribe must have looked on paper . \nit does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . \nin fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf\'s tribe as possible . \nin retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . \ni shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . \ndreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . \nhalfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . \ni say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . \nlater , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . \nso , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie . \nhe makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . \nhe simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . \naudiences at krippendorf\'s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . \nand proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . \nlike all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . \ndreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . \nhe has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . \nthis film also requires a lot of physical humor that i\'ve never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . \njenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf\'s work , is also very funny and appealing here . \nand the kid actors are great , as well . \nbut we\'re talking about the script from hell . \nthis is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . \nbut the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it . \nall the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . \nno , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . \nfurthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . \ntake , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . \nthey get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . \nkrippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . \nnow , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless . \nthere\'s no way they\'ll do that . . . oh \ngod ! "" \nthey did do it . \nit\'s there . \ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn\'t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . \ni found it deplorable . \nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . \nthe film is filled with scenes like these . \nthey not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . \nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . \nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . \nif i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . \nmoving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . \nsure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . \nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . \nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . \ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . \nno , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn\'t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . \nin fact , it\'s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . \ni suppose it\'s important to admit that this is a funny film . \ndreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . \nand if you\'re less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . \ni , however , can\'t get past these elements . \nkrippendorf\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn\'t be learning . \nwith a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie . \n'",0

"b'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries . \nwhile it\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\'s brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\'t deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film\'s bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\'s house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he\'s almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\'t even introduced too ! \nthat\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\'s flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\'s lair . \nit\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you\'re a fan of argento\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\'s essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn\'t have to be that way . \ntake argento\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n'",1
"b'i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \nthat is no easy task . \nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express . "" \nas a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise . "" \nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\'s acclaimed novel , "" lord jim . "" \nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system . \nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \nthey\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\'s scam . \nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \nlong before it happens , we\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\'s fleabag hotel . \nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\'s tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\' interaction , hank\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \nif "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\'s main avenue . \nand , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn\'t be a very good movie . \nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \nwhereas darlene\'s life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\'s face doesn\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade . \n "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \nhowever unintentional , it\'s all alice\'s fault . \nshe\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \ndar is innocent . \nit doesn\'t matter . \nalice is the subject of this movie . \nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar\'s father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\'s tragedy . \nthailand\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \ni believe the filmmaker\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass ! \nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \n\'freedom\' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them . \nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \nwhich is why the movie\'s other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? "" \nand "" how far would you go ? "" \ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\'s end is alice . \nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \nkate beckinsale\'s character might more properly be likened to the "" released "" temple bird referred to twice during the film , "" trained to fly back to its cage . "" \nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of "" character ; "" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that "" freedom "" is achieved within oneself . \nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \'kung fu woman\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \nin reading the many user\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \nthink about that . \nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \ndo yourself a favor : rent "" brokedown palace "" and watch it with a open mind . \nthere\'s more there than meets the eye . \n'",1
"b""for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . \napparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . \nin other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . \nmadonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . \nshe's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . \nalready two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . \nwhat's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . \nmadonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . \n ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . \nthis movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) \nanyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause his character is set up with the token wife and kids . \nhow obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? \nand get kicked out of the house ? \nand get welcomed back anyway ? \ndon't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . \ndafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . \nmost of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . \ndon't ask . \nanother thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . \nwhat's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . \nthe stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . \nthe thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . \nand the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? \n-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . \nthe director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . \n""",0
"b'magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft . \nat nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . \nit not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions . \nit is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . \nit\'s also a movie that will polarize its viewers . \ndirector paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn\'t let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax . \nthe character\'s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . \nthere is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . \nthere is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . \nthere is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . \nand there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . \ngiven equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) . \na materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . \nhovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . \nit is not a pleasant movie . \nthere is not one bad note in the acting . \nit is affecting and layered and wonderful . \nthere is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . \nthen he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . \nwalters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . \nrobards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion\'s roar when he speaks . \ndirector anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . \nthe problem is that he stays on them too long . \njulianne moore\'s character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . \nafter a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . \nquite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . \nand just what is the theme ? \nalienation ? \nhopelessness ? \nanderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn\'t make it easy . \nthe film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . \nit\'s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . \nat times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . \nother times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . \nanderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! \nwhat\'s surprising is that it mostly works . \nif you have doubts about anderson\'s intentions , i\'ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . \ndespite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man\'s capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . \ndespite magnolia\'s needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . \nthis is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . \nmy rating : a bulleye . \n ( stars ) \na side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . \nher lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . \nwhen she sings "" save me "" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as "" wise up "" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . \n'",1
"b""as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . \nalmost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . \nso it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . \nit has been done before with varying results . \nthis version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . \nthe basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . \nthere is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . \nafter the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . \n . \nunlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . \nthe ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . \nalthough this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . \nthe story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . \nthis addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . \nfor example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . \nfor instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . \nespecially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . \nthe characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . \nalthough the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . \nthe nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . \nas a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . \nbut , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . \nthe actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . \nthe acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . \nall in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . \nbut , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . \nso although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing \n""",1
"b'for a movie about disco-era excess , "" 54 "" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . \nthink of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , "" 54 "" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . \nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . \nin fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , "" 54 "" would be about as feathery as the time period\'s popular female hairstyle . \nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . \ninside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . \nthe film\'s fictional main character is shane o\'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club\'s velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . \nhis wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in \'79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . \nonce inside , shane becomes seduced by the club\'s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . \nhe has such a good time that he doesn\'t want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . \nhe quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg\'s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . \nafter rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . \nbut fame doesn\'t come without a price . \n "" 54 "" \'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . \nalleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since "" 54 "" sometimes feels like it\'s missing a scene here or there . \nnowhere is this more apparent than in shane\'s relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he\'s long admired from afar . \nthe romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . \nthat "" 54 "" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it\'s assembled . \nsure , it\'s shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we\'ve seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . \nthe film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( "" the wedding singer "" \'s ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54\'s closed doors and asks for a "" funky little treat . "" \nthe solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you\'re caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . \nnewcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it\'s a shame their subplot goes nowhere . \nmeyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in "" clueless "" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , "" one , two , three , attitude !

"b'vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks . \nit is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about . \nbased on anne rice\'s novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell . \nthe film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco . \nthe camera slowly find particular window . \na shape of a young man is visible in the darkness . \n "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ?

"" \nluis : "" everything will be alright . . "" \nclaudia : "" do you really believe that ?

"b'let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . \ni am not too fond of ted turner\'s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . \nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . \nwhen they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . \ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . \nwhen they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king\'s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \nafter convincing king that they don\'t care that his persona isn\'t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw\'s pay-per-view . \ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don\'t know where to begin . \nyes , i do . . . \n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \ni know he\'ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn\'t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that\'s how big an ego bischoff has . \n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon\'s screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title . \nthis movie\'s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man\'s wayne and garth thrown in . \neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \n3 . \nthe movie\'s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \ni know wrestling isn\'t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \n5 . \nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i\'ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king\'s trainer for sinclair . \nwouldn\'t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \ni hate that . \n6 . \nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \n1 . they\'re the better promotion . \n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \n3 . \nthey give their fans what they want and don\'t treat them like idiots . \n4 . they\'re winning the ratings and they\'re the promotion everybody cares about . \n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \n'",0
"b'it\'s almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter\'s follow-up to 1997\'s the tango lesson , the man who cried . \nthe gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn\'t even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . \nricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . \nblanchett\'s lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . \nco-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . \nthe actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film\'s lead rather than her dull companion . \nimportant historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film\'s little conflict . \nobviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . \nthe man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film\'s close . \nthere are forced messages here and there : "" go forward ; always go forward , "" lola preaches to suzie ; there\'s romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler\'s nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie\'s desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . \nthe film\'s main problem is that potter isn\'t skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . \nthe time period\'s instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . \nby the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . \nthe film\'s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? \ncontrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . \nalthough it\'s apparent that potter can\'t grasp what she reaches , i\'m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . \nricci\'s suzie is meant to be the film\'s core : from the extended flashback at the film\'s beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . \nso why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? \nthe character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci\'s . \nthe almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny\'s beautiful cinematography that renders the film\'s various locations wonderfully . \nalso worthy of note are lindy hemming\'s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . \nand then there\'s the music . \nfrom minute one to minute ninety-seven , there\'s hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don\'t undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola\'s interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film\'s characters and reinforce that state ) . \npotter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn\'t given towards ( almost ) everything else . \n'",0
"b'i have a confession . \neven though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i\'ve never seen any of the original godzillas . \n ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; it\'s the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . ) \nso , part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise . \nthis was a long-awaited treat . \ni was expecting a goofy good time , complete with bad dubbing , science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line . \nthe last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring . \ni can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt . \nyou do get all of the "" so bad they\'re good "" traits so normally associated with the franchise . \nbut you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot . \nit\'s a deal i wasn\'t willing to accept . \nhiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura\'s script crams in way too many details , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them . \nthe maneuver is not only disconcerting , but gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel . \ngodzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops . \nwas it a whim ? \na bold political statement ? \ni don\'t know . \nits foe , an ancient meteor that looks like prudential\'s logo , doesn\'t just fight the beast from the far east . \nno , it\'s got to have life-saving powers , a plot to erase "" the data "" from japan , a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature . \nthere\'s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit ( takehiro murata ) and a slimy government official ( hiroshi abe ) over the handling of godzilla , and personal issues . \nand then there\'s the plucky news photographer and blah , blah , blah . \nit\'s like watching magnolia all over again-except without the good writing , keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs . \nwhat a waste . \nwhen the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you , godzilla 2000 does the job-it\'s entertaining and goes down easy . \nthe action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish . \nthe dubbing is nice and awful , with murata sounding like he\'s in constant need of a cough drop . \nas for the dialogue , one line summarizes the goofiness factor : "" did anyone see that flying rock go by ? "" \nthis movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i\'ve heard the word "" imbecile "" used in casual conversation . \nthough the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments , i wouldn\'t take kids to see it . \nthey\'ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose . \n'",0
"b' "" i\'d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . \nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . \nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . \nfrom elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . \nwell , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . \ninstead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . \nand arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . \ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . \nwhen in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson\'s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves\'s most powerful scene . \nthe body of the story starts with sonny\'s coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . \nwith his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident\'s dying victims . \nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord\'s work . \nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film\'s director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . \nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love . \nwith a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . \nduvall has every movement down pat . \neven when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . \nhe dances and claps all the way . \nsonny\'s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \n "" i may be on the devil\'s hit-list , but i\'m on god\'s mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . \nand they lap it up . \npeople jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" \nand mean it . \nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \nbut sonny is no saint . \nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church\'s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny\'s church , leaving him unemployed . \nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \na man who can\'t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn\'t like recess . "" \nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn\'t seen in a while . \nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn\'t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show\'s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \nalthough it probably couldn\'t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \nand don\'t miss the sweet epilogue during the film\'s closing credits . \na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \n'",1

"b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\'t ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit\'s got some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" \nmoments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit\'s pretty obvious the film\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n'",1
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \n "" quick , robin ! \nthe anti-shark repellant ! "" \n- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg \ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it\'s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o\'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \nby ivy\'s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \nthe villains\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy\'s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \nakiva goldsman\'s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \nit makes goldsman\'s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i\'d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan\'s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \njoel schumacher\'s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy\'s chosen new abode . \nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \nmr . schumacher\'s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film\'s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \ni think it is - it\'s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" \neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \nmr . schwarzenegger\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! "" \nin the least inventive way . \ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \nchris o\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \nthe film\'s one saving grace ? \nundoubtably uma thurman\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \nms . thurman\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \n ( i\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\'s performance in batman forever . ) \nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\'t a half-bad way to go . \nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \nit\'s been a long time since i\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \n "" at "" , of course , is the operative word . \n'",0

"" \nit takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall , "" both figuratively and literally . \nlike the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall . \nroberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean . \nher life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school . \nshe soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors . \nthat is the pattern-like plot of this production . \nultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish . \nthe first hour of music of the heart is rather painful . \nroberta\'s character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat . \nalso lacking depth is the film\'s "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around . \nthe next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre . \nthey are highlighted by one child\'s return to roberta\'s class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can\'t be around anymore because "" my mom said . . . "" ) and a glowing concert . \nnot knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point . \nbut they don\'t . \ninstead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent . \ndirector wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing . \none romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but . . . \nlast night . . . "" \nand roberta\'s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father\'s absence . \nthe city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie . \nroberta\'s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype . \nthe noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta\'s students is gunned down and killed off screen . \none thing the film does lack is subtlety . \nthe fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference . \nthe fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience . \n ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) \neven with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . \nthat is not an excuse for the movie\'s poor beginning . \nbut as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . \nin december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . \nthe performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . \nso , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? \nhe had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . \nperhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa\'s favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale . \n'",1
"b'available for rental - october 12 , 1999 \n10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . \nthat said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare\'s work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey\'s crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca\'s sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . \nwith movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . \nyet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . \nthe first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca\'s last name : stratford . \ntheir family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman\'s larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . \nin what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family "" no dating "" policy is amended to "" bianca can date . . . when \n[katarina] does . "" \nwith prom just ahead , bianca\'s fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . \ndon\'t think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister "" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser .

"" \nin this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . \ncameron\'s friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . \nthe solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \nthis verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . \nmoreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that "" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . "" \nthe laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . \nproviding a constant reminder of the fact that this isn\'t exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend\'s betrayal , and prom . \nit is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she\'s all that , and can\'t hardly wait . \nyet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way . \n'",1
"b'disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . \nto see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . \nunfortunately , folks , it\'s not likely . \ndante\'s peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . \nto be honest , i wasn\'t very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn\'t make it sound promising . \nso i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn\'t bad at all . \nit\'s pretty run of the mill , but it\'s not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch . \nin case you don\'t know , dante\'s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it\'s shadow , dante\'s peak ( who would\'ve guessed , eh ? ) . \npierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . \ndue to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it\'s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . \nbrosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . \n . \n . \nor at least the mayor of dante\'s peak ( linda hamilton ) . \nnaturally the two will become infatuated with one another . \n ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven\'t seen very many movies ! ) \nthere\'s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . \nand of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . \n . \n . \nbut hey , i don\'t want to ruin all the surprises ! \nif there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante\'s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . \nit\'s not brain food , but it succeeds at what it\'s meant to be . \n . \n . \nan enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash ! \n'",1
"b""big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . \no . j . \nsimpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . \nall these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . \nand , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . \nwhether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . \nso when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . \nhowever , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . \njohn travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . \nno one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . \nbut , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . \na civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . \ntravolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . \nhis performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . \nif he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . \nluckily , he has a strong supporting cast . \nwilliam h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . \nhe continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . \nin a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . \nhe is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . \nhe is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . \nbut , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . \nrobert duvall is also an underrated actor . \nhe gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . \nduvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . \nduvall is magical in this role . \nhe is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . \nin many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . \nunfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . \nhowever , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . \nthis is not the case in a civil action . \nthey have comedy coming from all sides . \nwhether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . \ngranted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . \nthe plot is terrific- somewhat . \nthe setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . \nthen the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . \nthey find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . \nhowever , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . \ni will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . \nthe courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . \nit left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . \nall in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . \nhis supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . \nthe film is smart , witty and thought provoking . \nnot only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . \na civil action provides everything a drama lover craves . \n""",1
"b'depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal . \nbut in case you didn\'t know this , don\'t bother remembering it . . . \nthe words "" original sin "" never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it . \nthe closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) . \nregardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) . \nboy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife . \nsince this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful . \nskipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie\'s breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills . \noriginal sin then briefly tries to be a thriller . \nwe see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her . \nbut as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money . \ngirl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the "" other man , "" a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place . \nadd insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year . \ndon\'t even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal . \njust keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it\'s much worse than a sin . \nthis is sacrilege . \n'",0

"b'it\'s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . \nthat about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . \nindeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes\' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . \nthe main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . \nthe original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . \nwell , it\'s been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it\'s digitally enhanced . \nhere\'s the story . \ncruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . \n ( oh , how witty . ) \nshe rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . \ncruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . \na kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . \nat this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . \nhow low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film\'s villain ) sunk in the film business ? \nit\'s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . \nand depardieu . . . \nhow can a french guy have a bad french accent ? \nand never mind the toilet brush haircut . \nthe only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he\'s a rottweiler . \nnow that\'s funny . \n'",0
"b'warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \nbut it doesn\'t really make much of a difference . \ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \nremember when dante\'s peak came out in february ? \na few months later , volcano was released . \nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \nwell , it\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\'s peak . \nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \nto be completely honest , i haven\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \ndeep impact doesn\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \nthey announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival . \na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\'t kill off the entire human race . \nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \nit\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\'t work . \ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . "" \nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\'s that boring . \nof course , leder isn\'t all to blame for it . \nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \nchock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) \nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \nthat\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\'s forgiveable . \nwhat isn\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \ngive me a break , will ya ? \nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \njust when we think visual effects can\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \nleder loves to show the actors\' faces before and during moments of terror . \nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \nleder likes to flaunt people\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\'s face while drifting into space . \nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \non another note , leder\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\'s obvious it will be emotional . \nit\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn\'t work for me . \nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\'s "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \nher character is made stronger by leoni\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\'s "" star trek : the next generation . "" \nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \nit\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\'t worth much . \ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \nwell , it\'s not . \nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \n'",0
"b'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has "" cash flow problems . "" \nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\'t seem to put words to paper . \nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\'s block . \nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\'s author . \nironically , that couldn\'t be truer here . \nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\'s name in the credits . \nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\'s theatres . \njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\'t necessarily quality . \nand this certainly isn\'t quality . \nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \n'",0

"b""i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous . \nin the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . \nbut at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . \nthis predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . \nget past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie . \ntravolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . \nit turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \nlet the investigation begin . \nwith the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case . \nthings begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve . \nwoods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . \nwith echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . \nhere though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . \nthere are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . \ndirector simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . \nthe general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . \nit does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . \na few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . \nfrom a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . \nstill , the movie is certainly not without it's merits . \nthe acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . \nthe performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) . \nmadeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently . \none of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable . \n>from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . \nthe script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . \nin all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films . \nthe secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . \nthe general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time . \nbut it just could have been so much better . \n""",0

"b'by starring in amy heckerling\'s "" clueless "" two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn\'t just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of "" the crush "" -- out of the water . \nher only work since that 1995 gem has been in june\'s "" batman & robin , "" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . \nnow , she\'s the star and producer of "" excess baggage , "" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . \nsilverstone\'s emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . \nin an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . \nbut before the police can "" rescue "" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who\'s still trapped in the back . \nwhen vincent discovers emily , the two don\'t exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . \nalong the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation . \nit doesn\'t help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who\'s wise to his niece\'s ploys for attention and has mafia connections . \nfor at least a half-hour , "" excess baggage "" bounces along fast and efficiently . \nduring this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she\'s an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he\'s quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . \nbut once it\'s past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . \na road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and "" excess baggage "" likely covers its territory . \nof course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . \n "" do you like my tummy ?

"b'originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers . \nbased on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) , \nstarring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles . \nplot : high-school musical set in the 1950\'s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia . \nthe film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour . \ncritique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler . \nthis movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950\'s , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers . \nadmittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe\'s first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time . \nbut apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings . \nthis film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv\'s welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) . \nunfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie . \non the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" ) , and the plot isn\'t exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i \nam not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) . \nmake sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film\'s absolute highlights . \nand don\'t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you\'re feeling a little blue . \nlittle known facts : henry winkler , of tv\'s happy days\' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career . \nboth travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture . \nconaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john\'s sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . \n'",1

"b'one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . \nalthough black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . \nand if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . \nso it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story . \nnominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold\'s melodramatic music , ralph dawson\'s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl\'s lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn\'s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . \nflynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself . \nlet me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . \nthe littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . \ni\'ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . \nsimply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . \nrobin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . \nalthough the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930\'s james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . \nrobin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . \nrobin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . \nin this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country . \nrobin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . \nand with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . \nfilmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . \nin scene after scene the picture charms the audience . \nwho wouldn\'t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . \nand , of course , he doesn\'t just win , he does so by splitting the other man\'s arrow . \nwatching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . \nsherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn\'t seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . \nand then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . \nas was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . \nbad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . \nthe result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . \nhollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . \nthe adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 . \nit is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . \njeffrey thinks the film is "" great "" and gives it * * * * . \nhe recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies . \nhis favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) . \n'",1
"b""an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . \nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . \nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . \neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . \nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . \nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . \nif it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . \nand with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . \nwell ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . \nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . \nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . \nyou don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . \ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . \nbut john , it just wasn't scary . \ni didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . \nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . \nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . \nit's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . \ncall me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . \ni'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . \nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . \nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . \nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . \nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . \ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works . \nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . \nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . \nwhile they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . \nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . \nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . \n""",0
"b'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\'s 007 . \nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . \nit\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \nbond is "" helped "" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \nscaramanga\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the "" action "" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die "" fame "" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\'s "" funhouse "" . \nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior "" the spy who loved me "" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \n'",0
"b'seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic\'s pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \n "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it\'s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \nlabute\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \nwe\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \nwe\'re simply dropped in on the characters\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \nfirst there\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\'t know what they\'re problem is . \nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \nlabute\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \nit\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it\'s fascinating . \ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . "" \nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \nhe\'s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he\'s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \nshe\'s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others\' action , as that\'s the hook of the film . \nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each\'s scenarios , but it\'s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character\'s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn\'t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \ni don\'t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \nbut what this film does have that the others don\'t is repercussions in the end . \nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren\'t immortal . \nin what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \nstill , it\'s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . \n'",1

"" \nhowever , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . \n ( which i won\'t discuss for obvious reasons , but it\'s not * that * bad . ) \nstory : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn\'t that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in . \nalot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very "" parodyish . "" \n ( okay , bad term . ) \nextremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle . \nacting : as in many comedies , the acting isn\'t really * that * important . \nhowever , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more "" canadian "" type of mode . ) \ncarvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . \ntia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . \nlowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . \nwithout a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . \ndirection : spheeris is a classic "" music "" movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years . \n ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . ) \nshe is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy . \noverall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl\'s skits to go see this film in the theatres . \nhowever , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video . \nyou definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film . \nwithout a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year . \nit\'ll make tons \'o\' dough for everyone involved . \nlet\'s just hope they make a thousand sequels . \n[sorry , i had to get the lame joke in . . . \nforgive me . ] \n'",1
"b'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n'",0
"b""girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . \ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . \nthere was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . \nif there was a point to the film , i missed it . \ngirl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . \nthe plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . \nshe begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . \nalso , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . \nhe is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . \nher neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . \nhe also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . \nthe soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . \nit kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . \nfor parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . \nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . \nof course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . \nprince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . \nof the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . \nhe was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . \nhe should have stuck to acting in this film . \nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . \nthere are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . \nin that film , they worked to propel the narrative . \nin this film , they just made me more confused . \nthere are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . \nother than that , though , nothing much happens . \nthere are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . \ni'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . \nin girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . \nhe had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . \ngirl 6 earns a grade of d . \n""",0

"b'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \n "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam . \nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \nduring their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \nnote : i have not read thompson\'s book . \nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a\' changing "" in the states . \njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \ni couldn\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\'s eating gilbert grape ?

"b""starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . \nnow the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . \nthe fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . \nfast forward to the late '80's . \nsteve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . \nnor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . \nthat is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . \nthe other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . \nthe only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . \nit looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . \nthe special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . \nunlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . \none bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . \nshe is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . \nin terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . \nseems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . \nanyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . \nthe more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . \nand it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . \nanyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . \nnot really , but that is how it seems . \nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . \nas i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . \nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . \nalthough , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . \nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . \nalthough some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . \nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . \nsadly , it doesn't work very well . \nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . \n ( although that isn't so hot either . ) \nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . \n""",0
"b""adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money . \nwhich really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . \nwhile good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash . \nit's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making . \nbut i digress . \nsandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age . \nhis girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she's leaving him . \nby a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid . \nafter a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child . \nhowever , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn't the real father and wants to take julian back . \nkoufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child . \nbig daddy really isn't that good . \nmany of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny . \nthere's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . \nthe film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . \nthe court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting . \nit's a poor attempt to win over the audience . \nadam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . ) \njoey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash . \nsteve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny . \nrob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . \nthe two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high . \nbig daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles . \nalthough it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash . \nbig daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that's about it . \n""",0
"b""another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun . \nfavreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women . \nthe film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives . \nand all of this is great fun . \nswingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment . \nno , it just has a great script and superb little known actors . \nthe script , by favreau , is great . \nmike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex . \nthe audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script . \nvaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl . \nsome of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature . \nvaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . \nthe conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) \nthere are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence . \nembarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) \nmike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . \nalthough this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . \nthey just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . \nbut again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts . \nit's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles . \nthe acting is superb . \nas said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film . \nfavreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny . \ngraham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . \nshe hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . \nswingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . \nfirstly , the running time is a bit too short . \nthe film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . \nit never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! \nalso , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . \nbut these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy . \n""",1
"b'i\'m an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \nof course , that doesn\'t mean that i\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \nhowever , it\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \nin short , i had a good time . \n "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \nof course , the last one wasn\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\'s a bad thing , but it\'s becoming a cliche ) . \nso she\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \nonce you get past the fact that you can\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\'s okay . \nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\'t state it , but unless you\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\'s nicely covered up ) . \nthere\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\'s never really deepened enough . \noh well . \nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun . \nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\'s always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \nwhat\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \n "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \n "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller . \n "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \n "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\'s the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) . \nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\'s earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) . \nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) . \nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\'m sure i\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) . \nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" \njohner : "" well , i can get you off . \nbut not this ship . "" ) \nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \nshe\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she\'s just awesome . \noverall , it\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \nbut it\'s entertaining as hell , and it\'s definitely fit for the "" alien "" series . \n'",1

"b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \nit certainly didn\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom . "" \nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \'till death do you part business . \nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\'s never had . \nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \nben is an ideal role for affleck\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \nforces of nature isn\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\'s not what he thought it was . \nlawrence\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \nthat is , provided you\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\'t find what\'s underneath . \na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\' excesses can\'t spoil this unique concoction . \nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \n'",1

"b'this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be "" one of the hottest writers in hollywood "" . \nhe wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) \nscript to his mix , and also created the popular tv series "" dawson\'s creek "" . \nso when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said "" sure , go for it ! "" . \nuhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? \nplot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . \nwhen she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . \ncritique : it\'s not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . \nthis movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . \ni was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . \nzhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . \nhe also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . \nsure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes\' rival in the film , mrs . tingle\'s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man\'s version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man\'s version of johnny depp ! ) . \nall in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson\'s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . \nno hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . \nif you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson\'s father was a fisherman . \nkevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv\'s "" dawson\'s creek "" , a show kevin created . \nhe was once an aspiring actor . \nin fact , he even landed a bit part on tv\'s "" another world "" . \nalso , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book "" killing mr . griffin "" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \nlois duncan . \nhe has also come out and said that he is a gay man . \nhelen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . \nshe is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil\'s advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \nthis film was originally titled killing mrs . \ntingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . \nactress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called "" wasteland "" . \nthis is actor barry watson first full feature film . \nhe has played the character of "" seth "" on tv\'s "" malibu shores "" several times . \n'",0
"b'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : "" it mu5t be found . "" \nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \nafter seeing luc besson\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \ngaulthier\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \nwhile besson\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \nat first this character\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \nthe story\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the "" enemy "" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker\'s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist\'s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n'",1
"b""woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker . \nin his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy . \nfrom there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles . \nsome of these work better than others . \nzelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist . \ndeconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back . \nharry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives . \nhe wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing . \nthe story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments . \nperhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out . \nas a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises . \nthe film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life . \nthese fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters . \nit is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person . \nif that sounds complicated , it is . \nthen as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image . \nharry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time . \nas if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order . \nif allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable . \nbut allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand . \ndeconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement . \nharry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him . \njust why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear . \nharry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) . \nblock would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father . \nanother friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems . \nharry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) . \nit is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film . \nwhile the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny . \nthe centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry . \nthat story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story . \nthe linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care . \nthat character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes . \nallen can do much better than deconstructing harry . \ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n""",0

"b""coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . \nrelentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . \ndivorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . \nto make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . \nfans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . \nthey both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . \nthis one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . \nthe execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . \nuseless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . \nthe actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . \nsigny coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . \nbut she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . \n""",0
"b'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you\'ll love wild things ! "" \n "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" \n "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" \n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \ni\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \nbeing mormon , i\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \nand i like it ! \nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \nsure , it\'s all too good to be true , but ain\'t it fun to watch ? \nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \nthere will be people who don\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \nit\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \nwrong . \nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\'t turn out that way . \nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \nthere\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \nhe\'s heading the class discussion . \nthere\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \'sex . . . \n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \' . \n "" what is a sex crime ? "" \nray asks . \n "" not gettin\' any ! "" \none student responds . \nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \nand so , wild things sets into motion . \nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\'t want anything to do with her advances . \nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \nsurprisingly , that\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \nand what\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\'s rather pleasing . \ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\'t hard to watch . \nit\'s good trash , in a sense . \none , the screenplay knows that it\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \nthis varies everywhere from kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\'t worry . . . \nit\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\'s full-frontal nude scene . \nit\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \nand judging from many of the women\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \nand then there is bill murray . \nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\'t talking . \nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \nthen , there is the music . \nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \nit\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \nit\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\'s face it--people want to see it . \nso why not give it to them ? \nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \nand i can\'t stress it enough : don\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\'s who should see it . \nit\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \n'",1

"b'lisa cholodenko\'s "" high art , "" is an intelligent , quiet drama . \nits strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . \nthey are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . \njudging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers\' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . \nsyd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , "" frame .

"b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \nset in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\'t quite as sweet . \nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\'t care at all about having children . \nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\'t give her full blessing . \nthere are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \nmaybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \nthese "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \nrefusing to stay over at her parent\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\'t he ? \nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \nfor all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn\'t a perfect film . \non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \nmehrjui\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \ndespite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \nit\'s difficult to not consider how leila\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \n'",1

"b'the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn\'t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . \nthe "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . \nhowever , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . \nthose expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . \nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . \nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . \ni don\'t know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . \nonce again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . \nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . \nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . \nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . \nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . \nsoon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . \nalong the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . \nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? \napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called "" mercury . "" \nto make sure it can\'t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds\' puzzle magazine .

"b'in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can\'t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . \nthis is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . \nold friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . \nthrough process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . \nwhat results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . \nafter all , old ned won\'t miss it . \nrather than divulge the later twists and turns , i\'ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . \nbannen and kelly are a perfect pair . \none slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . \nboth getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . \nwaking ned devine may even be seen as a "" full monty "" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . \nwaking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . \nthe performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . \nthere is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . \nwriter/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . \nscripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . \nperhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . \nhad i held off on my year\'s best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year\'s finest films . \nit is light , but thought provoking and sweet . \ni can\'t think of anyone who shouldn\'t see ( or wouldn\'t enjoy ) this film . \n'",1

"b""review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \nbut for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \nfrank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \nbut dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . \nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \nthis movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . \nit's easily the best film of the year , so far . \n""",1
"b""i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . \nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . \nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . \nyes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . \nfor all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . \nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . \nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . \n`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . \njust how great are their hormones raging ? \none of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . \nthe four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . \nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . \nbut what is the perfect time ? \nthere is just no way to know , and that frightens him . \noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . \nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . \nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . \nso , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . \nsuddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . \nbut among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . \nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . \nhe has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . \nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . \nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . \nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . \nin fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . \nbut i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . \nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . \nbut unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . \nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . \ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . \nthey know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . \nbut almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . \n""",1
"b'topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil\'s advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don\'t know how to end . \nit begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . \nthere is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz\'s boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . \nfor the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . \nthe interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . \nat times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . \nthis doesn\'t sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it\'s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . \nunfortunately this level of honesty isn\'t maintained . \nwith about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . \nsuch a disappointment after such a brilliant start . \nthe actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . \nthe energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . \na lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . \nit seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . \nthat is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . \nup till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . \nwhile the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it\'s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . \nnot just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . \nthis is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . \nas stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . \nit just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . \n'",0
"b""have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? \nwell , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . \nbut after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . \noddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . \nin the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . \nusing an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . \nthe law firm's employees get a good chuckle . \nthe audience gets a good chuckle . \nthe eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) . \nthere is something compelling about this mysterious woman . \ndespite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . \nafter the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago . \nafter each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . \nthe eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . \nbut he does not alert the authorities . \nhe somehow empathizes with her sense of loss . \nthe eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past . \nhis daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life . \nhis tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation . \nshe becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman . \nhe now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation . \nit doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders . \nand it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens . \nhe follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble . \nwhen a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking . \nwhen the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape . \nall the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight . \npeculiar . \nhow bad is this movie ? \ni refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test . \njust take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes . \nfor this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . ' \nno doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . \nthe major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . \nif it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . \nif it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . \ncompletely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . \ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . \nbeyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . \n""",0
"b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\'s to live and die in l . a . \nthe money isn\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\'s movie was inspired by real life . \ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\'s directing skills . \nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung "" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \n'",1
"b'writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard . \nharder than pouring concrete under the texas sun . \nharder than building a bridge over troubled waters . \nand incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . \nthrillers are all variations on a theme . \nyou have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . \nyou have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . \nthe trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . \nthis simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . \nis anyone else getting depressed here ? \npoint is , it\'s not enough to follow the formula . \nyou\'ve got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version . \nsomething to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals . \nthis is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . \nwithout that something extra -- whether it\'s a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails . \nthat\'s why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f . \nbruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire . \nrichard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal . \nthe jackal is trying to kill someone . \ngere is trying to stop him . \nwill gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? \n ( i\'ll give you three guesses , and the first two don\'t count . ) \nthere are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , "" i wonder what happens next ?

"b'you\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \nthe title is generic . \nit\'s meaningless . \nand i can\'t believe it\'s good business . \nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \nyuck . \nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \nhis track record isn\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\'s , but he\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\'s radically different director\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\'s more operatic offerings . \nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\'s subsequent broken arrow . \nhere\'s the rundown . \nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\'s alain\'s exact double . \nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \nalain does some investigating . \nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \nassuming michael\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \nthat\'s as much as you need to know . \nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \nthere\'s a love story , too , but i didn\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \nshe\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\'t really be described as "" acting . "" \nof course , "" acting "" isn\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\'s ) . \nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \nthere\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \ndon\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\'s hard-boiled , it\'s an amazing moment . \nbut it\'s a moment that\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \nwhile woo\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \nbut it\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \n'",1
"b""this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . \nthis is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . \nyes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . \nit shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . \nand how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . \nalthough in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . \nthis becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . \nthe characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . \nthey should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . \ncommendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . \nbill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . \nfill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . \nit's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers . \n""",0
"b'i think maybe it\'s time for the batman series to be put to rest . \nnot only has the first two films\' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . \nlet me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o\'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . \nmr . freeze\'s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . \ni might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don\'t think that\'s what this movie is supposed to be . \nafter all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . \nnot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . \nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . \nmr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . \na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . \nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . \nnot bad , but wouldn\'t the police ( or maybe batman ? ) \nnotice if the road was on fire ? \ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . \n . \n . \n . \nit also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . \nas if three protagonists and two villains weren\'t enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne\'s butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn\'t surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce\'s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . \nall this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn\'t . \nin fact , it\'s kind of boring . \nmr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson\'s joker and danny devito\'s penguin . \ntheir evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , "" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! "" ) \nas it is lame-brained ( didn\'t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . \nand robin\'s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . \nstrip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a "" batman movie , "" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . \n'",0
"b'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . "" \ni\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea . \nit\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \nit\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \nthankfully the film doesn\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \nhe\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\'s easy to sympathize with him . \nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \nthe resonance to donnie\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\'t always seem to have much meaning . \nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\'s never a and the family is suffering . \nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \na climax of sorts does occur , but there\'s little feeling of a payoff . \nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \naside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \nit may be routine , but it\'s good , and that\'s respectful . \n'",1
"b'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \nit doesn\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \ncarlito\'s way , while hampered by depalma\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\'t seem to shake . \ncarlito\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \nboth highlight depalma\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \nyou sense that there\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . "" \npacino captures carlito\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \nfrom a story standpoint , there\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \nstill , it\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\'t break . \ncarlito\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \n'",1
"b'in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80\'s . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou\'d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn\'t showy or a tour de force , it\'s simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe\'s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\'s pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\'s because i\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\'s part of its charm . \nand maybe i\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n'",1
"b""`we run tings . \ntings don't run we . ' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \n""",1
"b'as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you\'ve got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . \ni am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world\'s biggest paid commercial for america online . \nand i wonder : is that so bad ? \nwell , the commercial part is . \nas for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i\'ll be okay . \nto paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . \nthey are both wonderful , but for all of hanks\' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he\'s suitably obnoxious . \ntom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he\'s going to get the girl : the only question is how ? \nmeg ryan , america\'s high school sweetheart , can act . \nshe\'s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don\'t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . \nbut , i like her best when she\'s , well , perky . \nshe is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . \nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don\'t really know . \nall i know is that i just like them both . \nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that\'s really hard to resist , and i\'m not going to even try . \nthey\'re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . \nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . \nhere , the setup is a little different . \nkathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children\'s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . \nshe is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . \nshe is also having an affair , of sorts . \nyou see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . \nthey have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . \nny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . \nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children\'s bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . \nevery morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! "" . \nit\'s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . \nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let\'s have sex tonight "" mantra , if you\'ll excuse my bluntness . \nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . \nhmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . \nyou know it\'s going to happen , the question is now ? \nthankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . \nit\'s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . \nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . \nhe is , i believe , america\'s greatest actor . \ndoes he show it here ? \nnah . \nbut he\'s still tom hanks , and she\'s still meg ryan . \nwhich is what this movie boils down to . \nit\'s pure confection . \nall the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it\'s all really sweet . \nthere are some immense flaws , like pacing . \nthe last third of the movie really doesn\'t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it\'s slow . \nonce hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . \ni even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . \nthe other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . \ne-mail ? \nwhen my kids are my age , i don\'t know what we\'ll be using . \nbut hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . \nthey just work together , and it\'s nice to see . \nit gives you , well , a smile . \nthe script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . \ni was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . \ni\'ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . \nyou see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . \nmovies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i\'d rather not think about that . \ni always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . \nand i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . \nhanks was the driving force behind one of the year\'s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . \nhe\'s also half of the glue behind the year\'s best example of pure entertainment . \ntom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . \nit\'s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . \nit may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . \n'",1
"b'starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \ntherefore , it\'s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there . \nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film\'s finer moments . \nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart . \npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren\'t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \nthis is an odd compromise , but it\'s one of the few elements that really work . \nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , "" colors of the wind . "" \nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \nwhile there\'s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \nit\'s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie\'s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn\'t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer\'s minds and plot holes that are never filled . \neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with "" savages , "" why did he so quickly change his previous "" kill as many indians as i can "" attitude . \nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \nor how about pocahontas\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \nas it is , i wonder if it doesn\'t give kids the wrong impression . \nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \n'",0

"b'there\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \nbut if it\'s an accurate picture of life on america\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \nfor from the film\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy "" . \nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \ntrue , the focus on pistone\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\' costume drama casino . \nmore importantly , pacino\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \ndonnie brasco\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \ninexplicably , lefty\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \nit doesn\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\'s . \njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \nin these pictures pacino\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \ndonnie brasco\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! "" \ni hear from springfield way ? ) \nso the movie is cliched . \nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\'s well-earned high style . \nthe consequences are painful to watch . \nits no exaggeration to say that the film\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\'s phony brooklyn accent . \nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? \nbut then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn\'t so true after all . \n'",0
"b'american pie 2 is filled with laughs . \nbut they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . \ni\'m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . \nbut the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . \nwhat separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . \nof the original , i noted it was "" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "" \nwell , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . \nat least they are a year older , but don\'t seem any wiser . \nfresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . \nas usual nothing goes right until the last reel . \nbut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . \nand american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . \nfor the most part , they are not shown as individuals . \nthey are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . \nit is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she\'s overseas on an exchange student program . \ndespite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . \nmost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . \nalso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . \nit is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . \nthe first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . \nthe sequel is more cynical . \nit knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch\'s encounter with stifler\'s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy\'s return as jim\'s well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . \nthe only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . \nin the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . \namerican pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . \nit is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . \namerican pie 2 is funny , but it\'s still a comedown as well as a letdown . \n'",0
"b'assume nothing . \nthe phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990\'s , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . \nthe phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . \nnovak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . \none of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . \ncharles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . \nseeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . \ncharles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . \nthe point ? \nto make sure she\'s not seeing someone else , of course . \noscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . \noscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . \nwell , another popular phrase of the 90\'s is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well . \ncharles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn\'t seem to mind . \nwhy is this ? \nhe thinks oscar is gay . \nhe\'s not afraid to share this with him either . \noscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren\'t gay oscar , i\'d have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles\' mouth . \nthe word spreads instantly through town . \nwill oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn\'t ? \none would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . \nmatthew perry doesn\'t escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . \ncomedy "" friends , "" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . \nnonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . \nit\'s wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . \nher voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . \nneve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . \nas usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . \nunlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . \nwhen his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . \nstick to the t . v . \ndrama , the practice , dylan . \nthe major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . \nno originality or technique is used whatsoever . \nthree to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . \nthree to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998\'s the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . \nthree to tango\'s script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . \nunlike last summer\'s south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997\'s in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . \nthe script is wise to take this route , as gays can\'t ( i don\'t think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . \n ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) \nthree to tango\'s climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . \nthree to tango is a gem . \nthe bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . \none of the better romantic comedies of 1999 . \n'",1
"b'there\'s some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn\'t and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . \n "" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it\'s such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . \ni know i\'m in the minority here but let me explain . \nthe film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . \njohn travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . \nruss is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . \nshe\'s a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . \ncrystal\'s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o\'neil ) , the tv station manager . \nshe doesn\'t seem to genuinely like either of them , but it\'s all she can do in this one-horse town . \nmuch like "" fargo , "" this movie tells the story of a man who\'s going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . \nhe enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . \nalong the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , "" dale the thug "" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . \nthere\'s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . \ni\'m not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you\'re not expecting . \nthis is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn\'t go as far as a classic black comedy should . \nwhere as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , "" lucky numbers "" is just funny because you can\'t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . \nit\'s all a big cartoon basically , but it\'s funny and i can respect that . \ntravolta is great in his role and even though he\'s not a really likable character , he\'s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he\'s a creep . \nhe\'s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . \ncrystal is just the opposite , she\'s constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . \nkudrow is perfect in this role since she\'s spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on "" friends . "" \nhere is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . \ni have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . \nlike "" jackie brown , "" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . \nthe screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . \nmore and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . \nthe ending itself is great . \nit\'s surprising and funny and makes you feel good . \nyou realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies\' worth of stories into two hours\' time and didn\'t fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . \ni liked it , and i could see it again - isn\'t that what makes a movie good ? \n'",1
"b'i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . \ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , "" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . \nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! \nwe\'ll have a hit on our hands ! "" \nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \nrounding out the cast includes swingers\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\'s . \nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \nit\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \nthe replacements offers none of this . \n'",0
"b'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it\'s important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . \nwhen seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , \nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . \nwhat\'s even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you\'re familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic . \nthis is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it\'s really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob\'s ladder . "" \ni\'ve seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn\'t so blown away . \nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . \nthe second time , not really thinking about how i\'ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i\'m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . \nthe story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\'s reach . \nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\'t live without . \nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \nwe get a sense that perhaps it\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \nthe censors wouldn\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\'s really impossible to compare them . \nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \nand although it\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\'t say that here . \nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \nit doesn\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \nhe\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \nit\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \nthe former is charlotte , lolita\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \nand she\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\'s about half of them . \nit\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\'s nothing more . \nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \nas you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \nthis version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . \nthe camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . \nthe acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . \nmore importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \nby the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn\'t regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have . \n'",1
"b'i have a great idea for a movie , one that can\'t miss . \nsee , i\'ve got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . \nit\'s about professional basketball , so i\'ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . \nas for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . \ni figure it will be a comedy , so i\'ll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . \nmaybe we\'ll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . \neddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . \ntwister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . \neddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . \nwhoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team . \ncoach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount . \nthe dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team . \nthe winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach . \nthe knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops . \nincidentally , the knicks eventually start winning . \nplease raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . \nawful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it\'s what they do . \nthose teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it\'s funnier when they screw up , and they\'re more sympathetic . \nthose which _don\'t_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . \neddie was cast under the misguided premise that it\'s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . \nthis finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) . \nperhaps that all didn\'t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . \nsteve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , "" don\'t blame me , i just work here . "" \nperhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn\'t a movie -- it\'s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . \namong the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas . \nand those are the real jokes in eddie . \nnothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , "" hey , it\'s donald trump ! "" \nor "" hey , it\'s mujibur and sirajul !

"b""books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . \neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? \nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \nit's about to do so again . \nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \n ) . \npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \ngo and see it more than once . . . it \nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \n""",1
"b'plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions . \ni have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise . \nthere are certain genres that just don\'t go together . \nthe film opens with a sequence that i still don\'t understand . \nit involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten . \nin any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living . \nthey make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america . \ntheir first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier . \nhis decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name "" gentleman highwaymen . "" \nlady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career . \nhe demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals . \nmeanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn\'t want his plans to be foiled by his partner\'s mindless romantic travails . \ndirector jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father\'s knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera . \nmost of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it\'s impossible to comprehend what\'s going on . \nthe camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity . \ninstead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits . \nhe barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut . \nthe weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters . \nthe love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic . \nwhen the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film . \nplunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level . \ni wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn\'t -- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache . \n'",0
"b' "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . \nit is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . \ndealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . \nthe director , marshall herskovitz , doesn\'t want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . \nthe film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . \nat this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . \nthe film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . \nhowever , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . \nthe story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . \nunfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn\'t get in . \nveronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . \nafter a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . \nhowever , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco\'s world , albeit not as his wife . \nshe decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . \na courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . \nat one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . \nveronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . \nonce she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . \nshe is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . \ntheir relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco\'s advances . \nin many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \n "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her . \n "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . \nit has multiple plot lines -- including veronica\'s adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france\'s military assistance in venice\'s battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . \nmuch of the film\'s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . \nknown chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson\'s ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . \nshe has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . \nthe rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . \nhe has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . \noliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . \nplatt is a good actor , but he\'s just too hard to hate . \njacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco\'s uncle . \n "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz\'s sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear . "" \npartnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething , "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" ) . \nhis directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . \nhe could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \n "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . \nherskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara\'s dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 ) . \nbazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . \nhowever , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( "" brazil , "" "" the princess bride "" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( "" the age of innocence "" ) . \nthe only problem with "" dangerous beauty "" is that it doesn\'t stick with you . \nit\'s a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it\'s easy to shrug off once you\'ve left the theater . \nthe only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it\'s simply too melodramatic and conventional . \nherskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . \n'",1
"b'in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy\'s jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year\'s smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . \napparently , it was just lying dormant . \nwith ivan reitman\'s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . \nford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . \nof course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . \nwhile some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . \nboth actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . \nnaturally , there\'s nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin\'s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . \ngranted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . \nbut the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . \nreitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . \nhis big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . \nas appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn\'t been quite this charming and affable in years ; he\'s obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . \nholding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . \nshe can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . \nformulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer "" popcorn "" movie season\'s lack of substance . \nit\'s certainly fluff , but it\'s unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . \npass the popcorn . \n'",1
"b'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . \neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . \nthis is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . \nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \'til dawn . \nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . \n ( i\'m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) \ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director\'s helm . \nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . \nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . \njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . \nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . \nhowever , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . \njackie didn\'t know they were in the package with the cash , but that\'s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . \nof course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . \nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . \nsure enough , ordell shows up at jackie\'s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max\'s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . \ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol\'s chamber to ordell\'s head , jackie proposes a deal . \nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell\'s half million dollars . \nwith a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? \nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \ninstead , it\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\'s movies . \nat least this film has a little imagination . \nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \nhe\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\'t occur to us , even when we\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \nin this film , he\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much . "" \nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \ndon\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \nthere\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\'s not really sure what\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \nwe look at the screen and think , "" gee , that\'s clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \nalthough tarantino isn\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\'ll just stop . \noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these "" offensive "" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \ngo see the film and see what i mean . \n'",1
"b""jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . \nenterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek . \ngone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . \nas usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . \nthis time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will . \nit turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . \nof course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . \ninsurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . \nthe film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . \nin this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . \nit doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . \nmany of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . \nthe other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . \nthere are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? \nthe explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen . \nso the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible . \nbut in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . \nthe other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . \nworf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . \nno problem so far . \nworf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . \nin the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . \nwhat little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen . \nmy minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . \nwhile many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies . \nthe special effects are among the best for the star trek series . \nthe action is plentiful and well done . \nthis is a very good-looking movie . \nit should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . \nit is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . \nthey interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . \nmost star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . \nif you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . \nstar trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones . \n""",1

"" \nwith that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . \nlester works for an advertising agency . \nhis growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . \nestranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . \nhis life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . \ncarolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . \nshe carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . \nbut inside she is desperate . \nunsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . \nthe third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn\'s daughter . \na young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . \nthis funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . \nnot one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . \nsome of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . \nmost notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . \nshe has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . \ncolonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . \nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham\'s . \nin fact they are the next door neighbors . \nanymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" . \nalan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . \nnot one character in this film rings falsely . \nand the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . \nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" . \nkevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . \nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . \nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . \nhe quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year\'s salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter\'s girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . \nmr . spacey\'s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i\'m so proud of you , honey . \nyou didn\'t screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \nmr . bentley\'s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it\'s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \nevery nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it\'s audience to think and examine . \nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \n'",1
"b""several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . \nthis is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . \nthere's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . \nthe premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . \nedwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . \nalong the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . \nthe explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . \nthis setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . \nfarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . \nmatthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . \nas a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . \ni'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . \nas far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . \neugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . \nfrankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . \nalthough guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . \nthe special effects , such as they are , are execrable . \nfor an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . \neven though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . \nwhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . \nfarley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session . \n""",0
"b'kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \namos gitai\'s fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli\'s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic\'s intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god\'s law from only the male\'s view . \nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \nthe story takes place in jerusalem\'s jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can\'t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \nhe even thanks god that he didn\'t make him a woman . \nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \nsince the hasidim look upon a woman\'s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man\'s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \nshe receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead . "" \nmeir\'s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \nmeir\'s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . "" \nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \ntheir religion doesn\'t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \nso when meir\'s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \nrivka\'s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \nmalka\'s mother is worried that her daughter won\'t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn\'t love . \nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka\'s wedding night . \nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \nbut the choices are obliterated by one\'s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . \n'",1
"b'a common complaint amongst film critics is "" why aren\'t there more literate scripts available ? "" \nquiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn\'t dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . \npaul attanasio\'s script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . \nthe film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g . \na \'58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . \ndeft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . \nredford departs from the usually overlight , "" cable tv quality "" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . \nquiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . \nalthough i was only 4 years old when the "" twenty one "" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford\'s almost tangible palette . \nfrom plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without "" disposable income , "" before the manifestation of its american dream . \nthe film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from "" the good life , "" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father\'s fame . \nthough the 50s audience that is "" rocked "" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . \ncharles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . \nthe tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . \nat the film\'s end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . \nlike the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this "" mirror "" may reflect an image we\'re not all that comfortable with . \n'",1
"b' ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \nfor starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse . \nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin\'s always-grisly special effects ) . \nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \nits easy to see why . \nthe world doesn\'t make sense . \n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and "" picking up the pieces "" he will be able to catch the killer ? \nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he\'s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \nhowever , david\'s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn\'t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \nbut if there\'s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \nseven\'s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a "" psycho , "" with no motives behind his slayings . \nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \nhe\'s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \nin his mind he didn\'t kill "" innocent "" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \nreally , seven doesn\'t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society\'s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \nbut then again , its a cruel world . \n'",1

"b'with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft\'s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . \nno doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . \nbut why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? \nobviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . \neverything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . \noverall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don\'t sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . \nbut you won\'t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , "" wow . . . "" \nlike the series of games , final fantasy\'s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . \nit\'s the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien "" phantoms .

"b'i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . \nand everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you\'re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . \nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . \ncontemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they\'re usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \nin fact , it\'s actually good . \nnot the original good , but what\'s great about it is that it doesn\'t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \nbecause it\'s cute and innocent fun . \nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \nand ( i\'m repeating myself ) because it\'s cute and innocent fun . \nthere\'s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it\'s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn\'t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren\'t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc\'s "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they\'d show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" ) . \nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children\'s animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn\'t dare missing . \ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap . "" \nit\'s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \nit\'s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i\'d probably dismiss it . \ni\'d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn\'t seen the original at such a perfect age . \nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \nthis new version did that for me , but it\'s also charming in its own way . \nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn\'t corny or condescending , but just right . \nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa\'s "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin\' fashion designer . \nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they\'ve only heard of . \nthey learn about eachother\'s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \nlindsay lohan doesn\'t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones\' accents aren\'t exactly perfect . \nshe\'s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn\'t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he\'s mr . meg ryan . \nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn\'t ever been this likable period ) . \nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o\'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film\'s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \nthis all brings this new "" parent trap "" to a level of entertainment that hasn\'t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who\'s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : "" it takes two "" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \n'",1
"b'the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \nthink about it . . . \nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \nthey aren\'t like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \nand they aren\'t like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one\'s done any of that stuff yet . \nwhen a new one comes out , you don\'t hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie "" . \nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \nmcconaughey\'s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film\'s opening sequence . \nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \nit\'s tense , exciting and fascinating . \nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder "" ok , now how do they get out of this ? "" . \nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it\'s a lot of fun getting there . \ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \ni mean , did we really have to see the ship\'s crew at a wedding ? \nbecause of that , you now know exactly what\'s going to happen to the groom ! \nmy other gripe would be during the film\'s finale . \nthere\'s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president\'s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \ni cannot stress this enough . . . \nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you "" that couldn\'t happen "" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \nit succeeds fantastically . \n[pg-13] \n'",1
"b'a cinematic version of one of john irving\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of "" simon birch , "" the treatment is merely "" suggested by , "" rather than strictly based on , the book . \nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \nthat\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\'s one that doesn\'t unduly harm the finished product . \nirving\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \n "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice . "" \nsimon believes himself to be "" god\'s instrument , "" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\'s plan . \nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \nsmith\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \nwatching "" simon birch , "" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\'s director and screenwriter . \nfortunately , simon birch isn\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\'s best friend , joe . \nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \nthere\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \nwell , that would be telling . \nperhaps "" suggested by "" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since "" simon birch "" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\'s extraordinary life . \nthe film also changes the book\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\'s lot . \nthe flavor of irving\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \n'",1
"b'after the huge success of "" the exorcist "" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . \nneedless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with . \nto start the "" story "" it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) . \nnow they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan\'s body , before it is too late . \nsome of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn\'t go anywhere . \nlouise fletcher is alright for what it\'s worth , but she could have done a lot better than this . \nthe direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn\'t figure out . \nin fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad . \nfor those exorcist fans who haven\'t seen this one , i recommend renting it . \ni actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else ! \nim not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere . \nbad , bad , bad movie . \n'",0
"b""dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . \nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \nhere's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \ndon't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . \nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . \ni don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \ni don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . \nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \nbut what a strange mess it is . \nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \ncan this be the same man ? \ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \nwhy ? \nwho knows . \nwhat are the implications of this ? \ni have no idea . \nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ?

"b'the year is barely a week old , and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997--the relic , a would-be chiller that\'s more successful at making the audience laugh than scream . \nin this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean-claude van damme vehicles ) , a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum . \nhow did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ? \nthe "" scientific "" explanation cooked up by the four--yes , four--credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes "" suspension of disbelief "" to new heights , even by monster movie standards . \nbut as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it isn\'t quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics . \nmiller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears . \ngive it up , penelope--it\'s a _monster_movie_ . \non the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it\'s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively . \nit\'s quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream . \nfor example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night . \nok , we all know what\'s coming , but as if we didn\'t need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away . \neveryone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie . \nand later , miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing . \ndoes she make a beeline for the front door ? \nof course not--she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall . \nwith all the cliches , it is only fitting the film\'s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball . \nif the relic is truly "" the next evolution in terror "" as the poster states , then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we thought . \n'",0

"b'talk about beating a dead horse ! \nwhen home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren\'t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby\'s day out , last year\'s live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year\'s flubber . \nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the "" home alone "" name as well . \nthe result ? 1997\'s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \nhe\'s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \nthis time , the kid isn\'t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can\'t go to school . \nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he\'s all by himself during the day . \nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \nit\'s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex\'s home to retrieve it . \nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \nthe movie\'s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \nthese are far worse . \nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \nif it\'s a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can\'t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \'90s technology at its disposal ? \nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \nit\'s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex\'s schemes are nasty enough to kill . \nbut , because this is a "" family film , "" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it\'s offensive . \nit\'s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn\'t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven\'t seen this stuff before ) . \ni can\'t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \nmaybe that\'s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \n'",0
"b'capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . \nto end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . \nthe somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone\'s taste . \n , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) \nmore than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . \nthis may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . \nduring world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . \nthis led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . \nwhen the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . \nminimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . \nwhile the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . \nthe best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . \nthat railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . \nthe best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . \nand just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . \nin the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . \nfilmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . \nthere are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . \ncertainly there was david lean\'s the bridge on the river kwai . \nthere were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . \nthen there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . "" \nlest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . \nit is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . \nthe film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . \nthe story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . \nit turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . \nbeating and torture are commonplace events . \nmen already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . \nhowever , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . \nso goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . \nthis is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . \nthe japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group\'s norms is all that gives a life meaning . \nconformity is purpose . \nbefore the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . \nif this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . \nif the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . \nit is neither . \nit is a stirring and believable account of camp life . \nthe color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . \nthis serves a double purpose for cunningham . \nit gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . \nit also creates a distancing effect . \nthe only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . \nthis is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . \ni rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'",1
"b""the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . \nalas , it refers to our heroes ! \nas it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . \nafter all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . \nbut the human race doesn't have much to worry about . \nafter all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . \nshe's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . \nthey're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . \nlucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . \nthe evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . \nsoon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . \nfinally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! \nit's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! \nvirus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . \nwhen considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . \nit's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . \ni liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . \nvirus takes itself seriously . \nand , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . \nbut what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . \nokay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . \nthey need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . \non the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . \nafter that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . \nthe leader , of course , is a big creature . \nevery film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . \nvirus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening . \nit's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . \non one level , virus is almost passable fun . \nit's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) . \nthere's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . \nthe bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . \nit rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . \nin that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes . \n""",0

"b'natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . \nboth films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . \nboth relate the story of a couple liberated by love . \nbut where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . \nwhere bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . \nwhat bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . \nwhat bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . \nto examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . \nfor the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . \nthis mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . \nbrahma created . \nvishnu preserved . \nand siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . \nthe following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i\'m forced to say it for clarity\'s sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . \nyour plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . \ni think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . \nmuslims kill christians . \nhindus kill muslims . \nchristians kill pagans . \njews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . \nreligion is an orgy of killing . \nthe institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn\'t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . \n "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . \nwell , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? \nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \nwe can\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \nas some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . "" \nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \n "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says . \nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \n "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \nwho else has found it ? --the \nman of today ? -- "" i \ndon\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\'t know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us . \nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \nfor example wayne gayle\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i\'d be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \nlet me exemplify what i\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin\' head i\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! "" \nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \nit\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \nthe style of the movie is a whole \'nother matter that i won\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \nthese can\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \nmickey to mallory : "" one of these days i\'m gonna be cummin\' for you , "" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \nat the time they haven\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \nthe two of course go hand in hand . \nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \nmickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . "" \nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \nthis is what mickey means by "" creator of my universe , "" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \nscagnetti\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\'s mouth . \nthe indian sage releasing mallory\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : "" old man , go be a snake , "" after telling his "" snake story "" that ends with "" bitch , you knew i was a snake . "" \nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , "" you killed life ! ! ! "" \nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\'t see themselves as killers of life . \nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : "" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\'t give a damn . "" \nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \nmickey : "" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . "" \nmickey ( again in his interview ) : "" me and you , we are not the same species . "" \nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \nmickey : how ya feelin\' ? \nwayne : fucking great ! \nmickey : you got the feelin\' ? \nwayne : i\'m alive . \ni\'m alive for the first fuckin\' time ! \nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \nhe got the feeling and he couldn\'t contain himself . \nwhat a feeling . \nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , "" think , think , think , think .

"b'are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? \ndirector/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland "" . \nthe two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other\'s orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion . \nis it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? \ndoes this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? \nas the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) . \nrather , he is ending it with her . \narriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings . \nin a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he\'s made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he\'s leaving . \nit\'s obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship . \nhe then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief . \nerin\'s mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin . \nto erin\'s embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a "" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life "" . \neventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "" poseurs "" . \nalan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he\'s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium . \nwearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish . \nlater , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away . \nthe movie spends it\'s entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing . \nthere are several subplots involving alan . \none concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business . \nanother subplot involves his father\'s desperate attempts to force fate\'s hand by gambling away his life at the dog track . \na distracting focus is put on alan\'s debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off . \nthe movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy . \nthankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin\'s distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality . \nthe film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet . \nco-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships . \nthe films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over . \nwhen alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze . \nit\'s a sweet , measured moment . \nthe disappointment comes in the fact that we\'ve come to know the pair , yet we don\'t get to view their impending romance . \nthe film\'s inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one\'s life makes "" next stop wonderland "" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects . \n'",1

"" \nastronaut a : "" yeah , that\'s mars all right . "" \nastronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "" \nthat exchange isn\'t actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn\'t be surprised if it were . \nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\'t tell . \nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\'t get what\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i\'m just here to get a paycheck "" attitude . \ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance . \nand sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy "" mission to mars , "" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of "" mission to mars "" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \nsupposedly we\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of "" armageddon "" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \nme , i alternated between the two . \nthere is only one good thing about the way "" mission to mars "" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \n'",0
"b'a friend invites you to a movie . \nthis film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality . \nthe plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city . \nthey need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over . \nromance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) . \nit stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood . \nyou accept . \nyou jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_ . \nbut , poor moviegoer , you have been conned . \nalas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_ . \noh , woe . \nyour hope has sunk . \nwhy was this movie made ? \nwhy was it released ? \nit is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved . \nat the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem . \nbut it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers . \n_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) . \nbirdy\'s nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_\'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film\'s many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume . \nwhat is the point of this ? \ndoes it make any sense ? \nis it supposed to be funny ? \nthe point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child . \nall of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none . \nthere are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion . \nthere\'s the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job . \nthere\'s the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer\'s . \nand then there\'s the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch . \nand during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question . \nwhat sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? \nwhat sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? \noutside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block . \nwhen the daughter stands up to the bully at school . \nwhen birdy almost loses her job . \nwhen the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up . \nwhen someone dies . \nwhen the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back . \nin a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end . \nwho can survive such a debacle ? \ni worry for bullock\'s career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years . \nshe has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can\'t handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent . \nharry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! \ngena rowlands is the best part of the film . \nbut she\'s such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she\'s weighed down by such lukewarm material here . \nit would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes\' great films is known for this film . \ntwo notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences . \nthere are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick . \nhave you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle . \n ( 2 ) you\'ve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer\'s filter makes the candlelight appear like little "" x "" s . \nyou\'re not a bad director , but you can\'t change a terrible script . \nthere\'s a recurring scene where birdy , working at the neighborhood fotomat , finds the machine go wrong , and image after destroyed , warped , dark image appear . \nthink about it . \na succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie . \n'",0
"b""underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . \n1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . \nwe always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . \nthis year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . \ncritics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . \nbut as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . \nthe always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . \nher husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . \nafter a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . \nof course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . \nhowever she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . \nshe pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . \nwhile making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . \nshe realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . \nwhich means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . \nafter she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . \nhe is a man who has had his share of bad things . \nwhile out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . \nwhatever happens the film was excellent to me . \ni found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . \nashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . \neven if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . \nthis is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . \nit could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . \nthe movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . \nit gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . \nthe characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . \neven though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . \nthe director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . \ni found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . \nit moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . \nit earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . \n""",1

"b'warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it . \nwhile i don\'t blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . \nbut , in a nutshell , it\'s a good film . \nstar wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim \nnever having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace . \nhowever , it can\'t be ignored . \nendless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . \nwith the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations . \nthankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better . \nwhile the "" first "" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) . \nwithout blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it\'s up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it . \nthe phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat . \ncommon complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects . \nstill , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for . \nhence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the "" improvements "" in the special editions ) . \nthere are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious "" pod race "" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in "" ben hur "" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids . \nutilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail . \nno matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new . \nthe level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans . \nbest described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show . \nunfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) . \nwith star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times . \nthere are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) . \nthat , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it\'s no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . \nstill , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point . \nthe film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you\'ll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn\'t mind doing again . \nwhile it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ? \nthe film is pure fun from beginning to end . \nand isn\'t that what really matters ? \n'",1

"b'one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb\'s runaway hit dawson\'s creek . \nfollowing in the foot steps of mtv\'s two other live action films , joe\'s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . \nset in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek ) . \nwe know he\'s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . \ncoach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . \nthe star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . \nalso on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . \nwhen lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . \nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there\'s a big game at the end . \nguess who wins ? \nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . \nthere\'s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . \nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . \nalso , the role isn\'t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . \nhe\'s still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . \nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . \nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don\'t fare much better . \non the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . \nscott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team\'s wild man . \nlarter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film\'s most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening "" whipped cream bikini . "" \nit\'s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . \nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson\'s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . \ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . \nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . \nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . \nthere\'s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it\'s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film . \n'",0
"b'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \ni liked that scene for two reasons . \nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \nit\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \n ( it\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \nit shouldn\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \nanyway , the deceased lawyer\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \nif this weren\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\'t know how to act in our society . \nit also doesn\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \nand as played by brad pitt , he\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\'s just there . \nit\'s as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "" \nit\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \ni\'ve used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\'s performance with this year\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\'s in city of angels . \nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\'s character is so shallow that she can\'t see beyond pitt\'s good looks . \nthe movie\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\'t save meet joe black . \nsir anthony hopkins isn\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\'s character more realistically evil . ) \nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\'m sure . \ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\'m asking myself why . \nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\'m going to do now . \ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \ndon\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . \n-- curtis edmonds \n "" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

"b'i had an epiphany today . \nit occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill . "" \nit is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it\'s advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? \nchances are , there * is * truth in advertising . \ntoo bad i didn\'t trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . \ni blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow .

"b""star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review \na review by jamey hughton stars ) \nstarring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g \nwith all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . \nthe movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together . \ncan george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ? \nyes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity . \nbut that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment . \nthe phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history . \nthe tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . \nthe vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . \nthe phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects . \nafter we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan' . \nthey are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo . \noh , but enough about that . \nthe prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . \nas you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader . \na spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter . \nthis particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see . \none of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception . \ni loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) . \none character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race . \njar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . \nyes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . \nthere is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . \nthe final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold . \njabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances . \nlucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness . \none can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii . \nwhen they arrive , you'll know where to find me . \n""",1
"b'based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire\'s latest meal . \nnow swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . \nhis latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he \nmust stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . \nadmitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . \njudging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . \nto some degree , i agree with this sentiment . \nhaving read comic books since the age of nine ( i\'m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . \n ( "" men in black "" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) \nwhy is this ? \nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \nsuperman \nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\'s television show . \nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\'m ready ) . \nwhich brings me back to blade . \nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\'bushe wright . \nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \nadd this \nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an "" anti-theft device "" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \nactor wesley snipes has \nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\'m really hard to impress ) . \nthe film\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \nwatch "" saving private ryan "" ) . \nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\'s sword without deactivating the "" anti-theft device "" . \nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \n'",1
"b'the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau\'s intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it\'s in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered . \nwith sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols . \ntheir sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness . \nless apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue . \nnot aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development . \nthat may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level . \nthe themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis . \nintimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "" human interconnectedness "" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) . \nshallow though it might sound , it\'s amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene . \nthose ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself . \nadapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london . \nevery wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives . \nhe\'s been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years . \nshe\'s a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction . \nthey\'re both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation . \nas the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire\'s personal routines . \nin his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn\'t existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy . \nif it weren\'t for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay\'s brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment . \nchareau\'s restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train . \nthe scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines . \nthese are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes . \nseparation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center . \ndespite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you\'d be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image . \nintimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw . \nan evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) . \nas claire\'s cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk . \nbangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with . \nhis overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations . \nin his unassuming way , spall\'s carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best . \nhe\'s that good . \n'",1
"b'while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\'s been sent to hell . \ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \nhence , jason\'s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \ntime passes . \nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \nthis character is merely a poor man\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\' vs evil . \nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \njohn leguizamo\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\'s relief point . \nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \nand then there\'s martin sheen . \nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \ni\'d never thought i\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\'s career is in better shape . \nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\'s fatigued about being normal . \nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \nnone of this is present in spawn . \nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\'s . \nas an example of this film\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \nmovies

"b'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , "" wow . \nthat\'s some ape . "" \njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \nhe breaks things on accident , because he\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \nas a character , he doesn\'t quite register . \nand the story he\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \nthe words "" family entertainment "" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \nit\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \nspecifically , she\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \nsoon , zoologist gregg o\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\'s mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\'s mother . \njill , of course , doesn\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\'t any characters , and the film isn\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like "" joe isn\'t happy ! "" \nand "" joe isn\'t safe here ! "" \n "" we need to get joe out of here ! "" \n "" joe is way too big for that cage !

"b""at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \nmy objections to swordfish are many . \nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \nand that is not enough . \nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \n""",0
"b'for "" original sin , "" the road to the screen has been rocky . \ninitially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . \nadvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . \nso is "" original sin "" really all that bad ? \nyes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . \nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" ) . \nmore importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . \nveteran readers know that , as a rule , i don\'t encourage people to patronize lousy films . \nmost of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the "" let\'s go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . \nbut things are different this summer . \nquality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i\'m concerned , it\'s fair to find our kicks where we may . \n "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls , "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it\'ll do until something worse comes along . \nthe film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , "" mississippi mermaid "" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie\'s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . \nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , "" this is not a love story , it is a story about love .

"b'at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . \nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon\'s parents . \ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \neleven years later , when he\'s established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana\'s brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \nthen , everything ends happily . \nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \nwait a minute , didn\'t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana\'s wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off ! \nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don\'t work . \nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \nironically , though , before the film\'s credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \nleonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting , and acting "" and at-a-glance film reviews called it "" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore "" . \ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! \nwill be forgotten about . \nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \nin fact , my insults don\'t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \n'",0

"b""out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n""",0

"b'no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society\'s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what\'s remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn\'t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it\'d be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren\'t married , and because they\'re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn\'t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he\'s too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i\'ll have to read it now ) . \n "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society\'s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn\'t . \nthere\'s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people\'s minds , and that\'s what "" jude "" is . \nsure , it\'s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- "" titanic "" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who\'s troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don\'t believe me , see "" titanic , "" branagh\'s "" hamlet , "" "" sense and sensibility , "" and "" heavenly creatures , "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \n "" jude "" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude , "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n'",1
"b'sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . \nit seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . \ni wouldn\'t be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . \nthe title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . \nof course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . \ndisturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . \nit\'s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . \nit\'s a suspense film with no suspense . \nit\'s an evil small town story with no story to speak of . \nit\'s a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . \nour main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . \nhe moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . \nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . \nthe big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . \nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . \nas a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . \ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . \nso , it\'s up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . \nby the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn\'t make any sense . \ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . \ni\'ve seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he\'s doing when it comes to screenwriting . \nhe did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . \nevil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . \nrosenberg\'s script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . \nand it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained . "" \nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . \nthey get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . \nthe doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . \nmuch of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . \nin one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . \nup front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . \nthat aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . \nfor instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . \nit\'s such an obvious cliche that i can\'t believe rosenberg even bothered . \nmost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me ! "" \nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\'t all that cool . \ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \ni\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \nit\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \n'",0
"b'i didn\'t come into city of angels expecting greatness . \ni\'ve never seen wim wenders\' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . \nthen again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . \nunfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . \nthe plot , for those that couldn\'t tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . \nof course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . \ntheir love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . \nusing this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . \nthe first half of the movie succeeds on most points . \ncage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn\'t know feelings so can\'t really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . \nunfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . \nas maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . \nher beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . \nlikewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . \nwhen the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . \nthe beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . \nthe film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . \nthe grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel\'s eyes . \nthe movie devolves into an examination of how seth can\'t feel the world or , more importantly , he can\'t feel maggie : he can\'t smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . \nthis change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth\'s intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . \nif he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn\'t her just make the leap and become human ? \nafter all , what\'s so great about being an angel ? \nsure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what\'s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? \nand from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it\'s all downhill . \nthe philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience\'s hankie . \nit\'s the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . \ni feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . \ni came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . \ni could go on longer , but i don\'t want to "" ruin "" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . \ncity of angels , then , is a paradox . \nit\'s a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . \nall these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . \n'",0
"b'in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . \nwas it "" deep "" ? \nnope . \nhowever it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . \nit was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was "" without the comic book uplift "" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . \nwhich was true . \nif what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man\'s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . \nif those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . \nsome critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that "" this is batman as batman should be . "" ; \nmr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . \nthe praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . \nthere was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . \nthe result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . \nthe villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman\'s nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman\'s body she gets pushed off a building . \ni admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . \nnothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . \nhints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . \nalas , these are only hints . \nthere are , don\'t misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . \na weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . \n'",0
"b'i swear i have seen the edge before . \nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \nbut taking scream\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \nfor once , we don\'t immediately care for the main character . \ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \ncharles\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality . "" \ncharles , bob , bob\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \nbut given the charles\' intelligence , and bob\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \nthinking . "" \ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\'t as it seems anymore . \ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \nshe isn\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \ndavid mamet\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \nit\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \nway to go , bart . \n'",1
"b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \nbut as the trailer goes , "" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . "" \nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \nnot that there isn\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\'s impotent father\'s ongoing lust for them . \nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \nthe answer is a resounding no . \nit\'s not that macdonald isn\'t a funny guy . \nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\'t hurt that he\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \nstill , macdonald\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \n'",0

"b'ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . \na romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? \nwith a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? \nyuck . \nbut it\'s not really too bad . \nit has a lot working against it , for me at least . \nin addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it . \nit does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable . \njust think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip . \nthrough a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another\'s way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity . \nin fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love . \nthe only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples . \nso this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman\'s model for this film ) . \nwill they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? \nwill they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? \nwill pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren\'t they all ? ) ? \nwill they finally kiss ? \nwell , what do you expect ? \nbut there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film . \npfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . \none word of caution , though . \nthis film is being billed in some places as a "" family "" movie . \ndon\'t let that stop you . \nhowever , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move . \nafter all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions . \nall in all , a good , non-offensive date movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",1
"b'vikings v . bears ? \nno , this isn\'t the lineup for monday night football . \nrather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . \nbased on michael crichton\'s book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . \ntheir strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . \nluckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . \nantonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . \naccompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . \nwe see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . \nthey laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . \nbut their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . \nhelp is needed quickly . \nan elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . \nafter a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory . \npersonally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . \nnonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . \nthe group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . \nof course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . \nbut he ably shows that it\'s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . \nhe is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? \nit does not look promising . \nthese creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . \nthey are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . \nthey attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . \nthe warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . \nthey are ready to sacrifice their lives . \n "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors . \ndespite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . \nat many points , i was even confused . \nfor example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . \nhe seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . \nhowever , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion . \nthere are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate . \nthe leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . \nhowever , banderas\'s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special . \nan entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . \nalso , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . \ni would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . \nas it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity . \nit would make thor cry . \n'",0
"b'i can\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \nred\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\'s dreams . \nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\'t ready to let sam\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\' "" i will dare "" on the car radio . \nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\'t expect what i got . \nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \nvincent d\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\'s something wild and neil jordan\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \ni don\'t want to dismiss baigelman\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\'t make his two halves into a whole . \nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\'s not much funny about that . \n'",0

"b'steven spielberg\'s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \nspielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \nhe also managed to cast this era\'s greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \nfor about 160 out of its 170 minutes , "" saving private ryan "" is flawless . \nliterally . \nthe plot is simple enough . \nafter the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \njames ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \nonce they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \naccompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \nbarry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \nthe battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \nliterally . \nthere is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film\'s first 20 minutes . \nspielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \nthe sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \nthere are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \nthis is what coppola was looking for in "" apocalypse now "" , but couldn\'t create . \nthe sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \nthe performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \nhe is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \nhanks is this country\'s finest actor , and he proves it here . \nhowever , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \nwith a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \nthe sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn\'t hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \nbut that is forgivable . \nwhat isn\'t is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \nthe first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \nthe last sequence is atrocious . \nthe forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \nthese flaws are what downgrade "" ryan "" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \nspielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \nthe use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie\'s theme . \nthe power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \nspielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . \nthis is the film of the year . \n'",1

"" \nit\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it\'s kruger\'s "" style "" , not the director\'s that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" . \nand his numerous twists can\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character "" . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n "" how did you know that ? "" \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe\'s quickly becoming miramax\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company\'s current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\'s bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\'s never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \n'",0
"b'some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don\'t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \nvan dorn is worried because he doesn\'t believe that his daughter would run from home . \nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast\'s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today\'s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \ninstead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren\'t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn\'t deserve to experience parent\'s worst nightmare . \nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen\'s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn\'s ( his own parents wouldn\'t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\'t be too surprising . \nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \n'",1
"b""chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . \nthe truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . \nthis particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius . \nthat would be pretty nasty . \nthe power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island . \nlong accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance . \nthe commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops . \nupon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder . \nprotecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder . \nall the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees . \nthis proves to be tricky . \namong the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle . \nthey also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . \nto put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice . \ndirector hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie . \nwhen there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it . \nperhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice . \ntake the villains , for example . \nthey are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen . \nthey speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways . \nthe tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is . \nfrankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . \ni suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner . \ngooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' \nthis is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . \nbut where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . \nat least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . \nthe supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . \nto be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . \nand i did chuckle a few times . \none example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . \n`you own this place ? ' \nthe general asks . \n`yeah , ' ulrich says . \n`they call me darlene . ' \nthese little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . \nas a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . \nsadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been . \n""",0
"b'the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer\'s "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" \nright for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . \nthe camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . \nit is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . \na strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . \ntheir characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller\'s crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo . "" \nin all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people . \nulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . \nbut , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million . \ntheir odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer\'s original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . \nthere is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . \nthe story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys\' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . \nsome of the interludes are an epiphany , though . \nthe trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . \nthey become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow .

"b""an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . \nthat's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . \nthat aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . \nthe acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . \na few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . \non the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . \nthe character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . \nas far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . \nall these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . \nthe directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . \nmatthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) . \nthere is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . \nthe one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it . \ni certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it . \nall in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch . \nalthough there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them . \ni wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie . \n""",0
"b'i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . \nit really scared me , and i didn\'t want to go see it . \nhowever , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . \ni didn\'t get a chance to do so , until now . \nthe film , disney\'s 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . \nit has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . \nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper\' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen\'s thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings\' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \nwhen he hears hen wen\'s squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\'s castle from far away . \ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \nthe three manage to escape the horned king\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\'s trail . \nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\' , to a whirlpool . \nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy\'s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \nbut ? the cauldron can\'t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\' . \nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \nthe trade is made ; gurgi\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\'s fondest dream . \nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \nmany of the studio\'s old men had retired or died . \ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\' from lloyd alexander\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\' and `unmemorable\' , compared to other disney animated features . \nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\'s reputation . \nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \nthe people who had seen the film didn\'t think so . \nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\'t . \nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\'t expect much at all . \nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ? \nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ? \nthis doesn\'t seem like all of the above . \ninstead , it\'s a classic in its own right . \nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \nthere\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\'s hero . \nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \nthere\'s a likeable character here ! \nnot that he\'s the only likeable character in the film . \nthere\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\'t quite hit it off at first . \nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \nelmer bernstein\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \neven though it doesn\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \nthat better chance has finally come . \nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\'s most proudest achievements . \ni can\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

"b'this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . \nwhether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . \nthe main problem was fairly simple : the film\'s climax was unworthy of its build-up . \nsomeone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . \nnow available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . \nthe plot is thus . \nwe meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . \nthe rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . \nrequiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . \nbut a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they\'re dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren\'t speaking russian "" . \nmeanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . \nthis crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . \nthe human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron\'s aliens . \nthe stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . \nand so they should be : cameron\'s technical credentials are well established . \nbut what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis\' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . \nthe abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . \none is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . \nthe second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film\'s end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . \nwith the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story\'s climax is now given real weight . \nwhy on earth were they left out of the original ? \nthis reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . \nso then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that\'s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . \ni say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain . \nthe most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . \nnonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron\'s greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . \n'",1
"b'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\'s the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\'s representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n'",1
"b'54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \nand it\'s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they\'re in this year\'s boogie nights . \nthey are so wrong . \nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \nbased on this film , i don\'t know how he got a job in the business . \n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \ni don\'t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson\'s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \n54 can\'t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \nit\'s remarkably bad timing , i\'d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell\'s homosexual impulses . \nit\'s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \nwhy his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he\'s been elevated to bartender status ) . \nthere isn\'t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \nthere\'s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they\'re arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \nthen , they\'re kissing in a bowling alley ! \nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn\'t a long film to begin with ) . \ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \nthis one doesn\'t . \nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg\'s star-making role in boogie nights . \nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \nhe\'s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn\'t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \nby the end of 54 , shane\'s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher\'s wading-pool of a script . \nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \ni\'ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \nfrankly , i don\'t care . \nit\'s easy to recreate something technical like this . \na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \naside from myers\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \nit\'s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they\'re so obvious to me . \nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \nit doesn\'t even work as mindless entertainment : it\'s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \nso , don\'t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \neverything else i said was just padding . \n'",0

"" \nit took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept . \nthe biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris\' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock\'s creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art . \narguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock\'s labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema . \n ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) \ngranted , it\'s possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock\'s splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing . \nthe movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions . \nand it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion . \n_pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression . \na brief introduction to pollock\'s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush . \nin a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , "" you paint the fucking thing , "" and leaves in a huff . \nby the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision . \n ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . ) \nsuch a union is destined to implode , and i hope i\'m not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . \nwhile it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock\'s conniptions too many : "" you are killing me ! \nyou are killing me ! \nyou are killing me ! "" \n ( aside : harris\' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . ) \npollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth . \ni love jackson pollock\'s stuff and i am enamoured of harris\' _pollock_ as well . \nit\'s scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal\'s hummable but no less lamentable score--i can\'t imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images . \none of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock\'s process to reload his camera or take a dinner break . \na more seasoned director might\'ve been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal . \n'",1
"b""along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . \nfor all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . \nthe australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . \naccepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood . \nit was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face . \nbraveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film . \nfor three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . \nthe william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries . \nseeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . \nas the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up . \nhis courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son . \nhowever , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought . \nbraveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . \nmel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast . \npatrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . \nthe scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good . \nsophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart . \ni also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace . \nhowever , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor . \nthe excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is . \nwhen we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film . \nbraveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 ! \ni've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean . \nfor now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia . \nit won't be easy ! \nit's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson . \n""",1

"b'when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the \'60s cartoon series of "" mr . magoo , "" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . \nmr . \nmagoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . \nin fact , they were wrong . \nmr . \nmagoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it\'s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . \nit\'s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . \nlook at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you\'ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . \nmagoo . \nthe best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . \nthe worst , mr . \nmagoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . \nthe first problem with mr . \nmagoo is the script . \ndespite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . \nmagoo is comically barren . \nfrom beginning to end , there\'s not a laugh to be found . \nevery attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . \nyou\'d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that\'s not the case . \ni\'ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . \nthen there\'s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . \nin the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . \nlately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . \nmagoo . \neven if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we\'re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . \nthis is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . \nthe story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . \nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . \nthe bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . \nmatt keeslar portrays one of magoo\'s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . \nthe bumbling man\'s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . \nmost of mr . \nmagoo\'s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . \nthe cartoon violence level in this film doesn\'t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it\'s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . \nthere\'s a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean\'s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn\'t hold up well . \nthen there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo\'s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . \ni\'m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . \ntong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . \nhis chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . \nlike john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . \nit is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . \nmagoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . \nthe screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn\'t seem to be enjoying themselves . \nwhen the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . \nher pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . \nmr . \nmagoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen . \n'",0
"b'susan granger\'s review of "" american outlaws "" ( warner bros . ) \nthomas edison\'s "" the great train robbery "" ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and "" jesse james under the black flag "" ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero . \nnow , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . \nthe story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . \nand an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . \nbut when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o\'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad\'s supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . \nplus there\'s romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . \nworking from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . \nthe choppy editing hurts but russell boyd\'s cinematography , luke reichle\'s designer duds and trevor rabin\'s music lend authenticity . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" american outlaws "" is a galloping , formulaic 3 . \nit\'s the wild west re-visited as a date movie . \n'",0

"" \ni never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . \nthe movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . \nexplanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye\'s imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn\'t leave ms . judd . \nexplanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "" \nwhoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . \nthat\'s as deep as it gets , folks . \nthere is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . \nthere are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . \nmy personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers\' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley\'s awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . \neach one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . \nthe script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . \nany time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . \nbewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . \newan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . \njason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . . \ncut to random guy with eye patch . . . \niguana out of focus . . . \niguana comes into focus . \nwow , man . \nwhen i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . \nthere are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . \nand i wouldn\'t be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director\'s cut . . . \nnot that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . \nthe last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . \nsome guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn\'t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . \nsomeone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , "" shut the hell up !

"b'capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers . \nwilhelm furtwangler , then the world\'s greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis . \nwhat were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? \nhow much did he know about crimes against humanity ? \nthe us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation . \n , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nin my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo\'s sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists . \nszabo\'s follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope . \nit is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them . \nronald harwood\'s screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich . \nmaj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe\'s greatest classical music conductor . \nwhen other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen . \nafter the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes . \nhe secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty . \nfrom there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra . \nas he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation . \nthere is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting . \nperhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed . \nif so , perhaps he can never come to the truth . \nin large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . \nwhere the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . \nit has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act . \nwhen it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . \nperhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . \nwe are given clues to something but they are never tied up . \nin the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . \nthe film is basically a stage play . \nthe visual is not very important . \ncorners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . \nas with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing . \ni rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n[there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . \nat one point we clearly see arnold\'s desk calendar say "" jan 16 tues .

"b'making your first feature film ain\'t easy . \nassemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you\'re already ahead of the game . \nbut rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . \nhow many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? \nthe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . \nagain . \nfive irish kids in nyc\'s hell\'s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop . \nwith teary music . \nand slow motion . \nin the film\'s first scene . \nthe kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . \nleading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante . \ni\'d like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . \nhe\'s concerned about buddy jason gedrick\'s heroin abuse . \nhe sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin\'s character\'s sister . \nhe looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) . \nbut none of this ever really amounts to anything . \nit seems that moresco\'s greater concern is to provide that intangible "" slice of life "" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone\'s been trying to evoke since scorsese\'s early work . \nso , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . \n ( do people actually do this ! ? ) \nwe get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not . \nwe also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose . \nbruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you\'ve seen in movies just like this one before . \nassante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin\'s performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it\'s almost funny . \nmoresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . \nas a result , the movie\'s style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down . \nnearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . \nwith slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don\'t comprehend the link to the past . \nmoresco needs to either trust his audience\'s intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . \nhis next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . \nif he actually gets that chance . \nreviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . \n'",0
"b'after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last . \nredford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he\'s proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . \nordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed . \nwhile the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um , \nrealism , and i\'ve never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing . \nthe horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery . \nscott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi . \ngrace\'s horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad . \nannie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace\'s newly-broken spirit . \neventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed "" horse whisperer "" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind . \neventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom\'s family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer . \nthe horse whisperer is delicately made . \ni dare say lyrical , since to many people\'s ear , that word is synonymous with boring . \nhardly . \nthe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . \nscott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . \nrobert richardson\'s photography casts montana as heaven on earth . \n ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) \nthe underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . \nhe is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse\'s motivation . \nunfortunately , one of the horse whisperer\'s only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . \ni liked both of them , but i didn\'t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . \nluckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn\'t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters\' complex relationships together . \n'",1
"b""mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \nthis time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \nhowever , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . \nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . \nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \nthe action is a mixed bag here . \nthere's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . \nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \nthe action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \nthe film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \nif you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \nhowever , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \n""",0
"b""wow ! what a movie . \nit's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don't . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n""",1
"b'my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \ni love ralph fiennes . \ni love uma thurman . \ni love sean connery . \nhell , i\'m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i\'ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \nthe film i saw today didn\'t even meet those expectations . \nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \ni would slam it harder , if it weren\'t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \nthat\'s the main problem with the avengers : for all it\'s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \nit\'s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \nthis is just plain depressing . \nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i\'ve never watched an episode . \ni wasn\'t alive then . \ni don\'t even watch television now . \ni\'m very sorry that i don\'t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i\'ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \ni didn\'t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \nthey are to work together , under mother\'s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \n . \n . \nthe weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film\'s few funny lines ) . \nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \nnow , killer bugs don\'t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \nthey\'re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they\'re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \nthe special effects aren\'t bad , but they\'re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn\'t do any good to think . \nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn\'t tell us what happens . \nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn\'t make the final cut . \nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \nthe scenes that don\'t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \nthey aren\'t . \nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \nthey aren\'t , either . \nand what about this wasted cast ? \noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \nwe\'re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \ni love the guy . \ni\'ve loved all his films , until this one . \nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he\'s as lost as we are . \nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can\'t manage to look at home here . \n ( i don\'t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can\'t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \nwho is to blame ? \nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \nis it the actors ? \nfor god\'s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn\'t have been given the task to begin with . \nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \nif the avengers has a saving grace , it\'s the set design . \nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter\'s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \ni also enjoyed michael kamen\'s music score , particularly in the opening credits . \nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there\'s a lot more that needs to be here . \ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \nor a sense of purpose . \nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \n'",0

"b'there\'s a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election . \nbased on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton . \nbut he doesn\'t actually play stanton . \nhe plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) . \nthe film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton . \nhe searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss\' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers . \nrichard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president\'s advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign\'s eccentric "" tougher than dirt "" incriminator . \ntogether they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race . \nin its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue . \nbut whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it\'s characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent . \nseeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look . \nand the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden . \nat occasions , you can\'t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste . \nthere are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry\'s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film . \nhaving said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch . \nbut frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ? \nmost of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film . \nbut as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public\'s opinion . \nalthough at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is . \nthankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it\'s scary . \n'",1
"b'let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . \ni adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998\'s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . \nwas it any good ? \nwell , just about as good as baldwin\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \nnow let me clarify , i don\'t love just any cop movie ; i\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \ni\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \ntruth is i\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \nyes it\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \nas an adult my tastes haven\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring . \nnow what if it\'s the cops who\'re the corrupt ones ? \nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\'t . \n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\'t make it to where he should have . \n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \ndanny has done this , and though he\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" . \nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \nright away we know that that is exactly what he\'ll have to do . \nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \nlumet\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \nlumet\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \nthis isn\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\'s most recent cop \\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \nof course cop movies aren\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\'s never funny , and on and on . \nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \nthere\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \nhe\'s lost his voice . \ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \n'",1

"" \nthe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it\'s a bad thing to make decisions when you\'re suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . \n ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . \n ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth\'s no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he\'s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . \nbeatty\'s work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? \nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? \nhere is a man who\'s reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? \ni like that the film doesn\'t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? \nsome of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? \nmuch of the film is completely absurd , but that\'s the fun part about it . ? \nit\'s an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? \nwhat adds to this feeling is beatty\'s portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . \n ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he\'s always funny , but he\'s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . \n ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . \nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? \nberry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? \ndon cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? \noliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he\'s very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . \nis bulworth offensive ? ? \ni suppose some may see it that way . ? \ni wasn\'t offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? \ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? \nthe film isn\'t perfect , of course -- the ending didn\'t quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? \nbut these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? \nbulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? \n'",1

"b'after 1993\'s "" falling down , "" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . \nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( "" the client "" and "" a time to kill "" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher\'s potential , the publicity for his latest release , "" 8mm , "" raised new hope . \nit promised to be something unusual . \nit wasn\'t . \nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband\'s belongings . \nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher\'s "" batman & robin "" ) . \nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl\'s name and tracks her to los angeles . \nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader\'s "" hardcore , "" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \nboth films are modeled on dante\'s "" the inferno , "" of course ; "" 8mm "" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \n "" hardcore "" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \n "" 8mm "" had a lot of promise . \nin its better moments it\'s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he\'s reading truman capote\'s "" in cold blood "" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \n "" in cold blood "" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , "" dance with the devil and the devil don\'t change ; the devil changes you .

"b""screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe's a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . \nif you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n""",1
"b'in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . \npresident john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson\'s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days . "" \none of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . \nthat teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . \nnow , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america\'s and the world\'s history . \ntaken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o\'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . \nas o\'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . \nmeanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . \nsuddenly , ken\'s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . \nwhere "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . \nthere is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . \nit shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . \nthe cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . \ncostner\'s o\'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . \nthis puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america\'s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . \nkenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . \nthe meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . \nthis is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . \nthe story does not just cover the face-off between the world\'s two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . \nthe disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . \nthe missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america\'s dignity and world leadership intact . \nwhile the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . \nthis is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . \nwhen the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . \nthe most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . \nthis is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . \nthe ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . \ngreenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . \ninstead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . \nkennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . \ncostner , as ken o\'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . \ncostner plays o\'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . \nthe rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . \nthe rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . \nstanding out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . \nthe filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . \ndylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . \nkevin conway gives his general lemay the right "" bomb them to hell "" attitude . \nalso notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o\'donnell\'s admonition , "" don\' get shot . "" \ntech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . \nit\'s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . \nsolid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . \nthere is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . \nthe special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . \nthe cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . \nhelmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . \ni give "" thirteen days "" an a- . \n'",1

"b'so , it\'s thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . \nthat might have been an exciting notion if it wasn\'t for the fact that the "" odd couple "" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993\'s "" grumpy old men , "" 1995\'s "" grumpier old men , "" and 1997\'s "" out to sea "" ( i . e . \n "" grumpiest old men "" ) . \nso , "" the odd couple ii "" ( i . e . \n "" the grumpiest old men of all , really "" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . \nthe plot is even similar to that of "" grumpy old men "" in that lemmon and matthau\'s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . \noscar\'s son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix\'s daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . \n . \n . \nthen hilarity ensues . \nwell , a few chuckles ensue anyway . \nneil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . \nunlike the original play/movie , "" odd couple ii "" doesn\'t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . \ninstead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of "" cybill "" and jean smart of "" designing women "" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . \nthe original 1968 movie "" the odd couple "" remains a classic comedy . \nit introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . \nit was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966\'s "" the fortune cookie "" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , "" the front page "" ( 1974 ) and "" buddy buddy "" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . \nthe reunion of lemmon and matthau in "" grumpy old men "" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . \nbut "" out to sea "" and "" the odd couple ii "" are just beating a grumpy old horse . \n ( you can add lemmon\'s "" my fellow americans , "" i . e . \n "" grumpy old presidents , "" to that list , too . ) \nlet\'s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . \nlet\'s hope also that we see neil simon\'s name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993\'s "" lost in yonkers "" ) . \n'",0
"b""in our time . \nin our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . \nand yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . \nin warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . \nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . \nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . \nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . \nthe afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . \nit is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . \nescaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . \nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . \nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . \nthere's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . \nand there are more problems besides its title . \nof course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . \nwe call it 'modernization' . \nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . \nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . \nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . \nand as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . \ni must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . \ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . \nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . \nunfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . \nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . \nthe love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . \njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . \ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . \nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together . \nthe other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . \ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . \nbut there's more than acting to worry about . \neven with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . \nto make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . \nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . \nand in the end it's nothing . \nthere are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . \nso again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . \nthis film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . \nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . \nit is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . \nbut when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . \nas in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . \nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . \nfor someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . \nfor those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells . \n""",0
"b'urban legend surprised me . \nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \nthankfully , legend rose above it\'s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \nyou\'re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who\'s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody\'s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \nonly person you didn\'t suspect ! \nhowever , just because legend doesn\'t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can\'t qualify as first-class entertainment . \nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i\'ve had at the movies all year . \nthe thing is , i\'m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie\'s two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) . \nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \ni don\'t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \none problem , though . \nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \ni thought not . \npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \nit\'s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody\'s on the other line . \nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \na decapitation . \nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \nso who is it this time ? \nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \na-ha . \nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn\'t suspect . \ni\'m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \n'",1

"b'showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone\'s taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \npossibly that movie\'s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters\' future , so there was no need to film it . \nthere was actually about four hours\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who\'s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who\'s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we\'re left feeling good about her future . \nthis is not one of the great movies , but it\'s far better than we\'d been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he\'s exploring the sleeze . \nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director\'s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it\'s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \nit\'s about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \nit\'s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don\'t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \nan nc-17 movie which isn\'t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \nif anything , it\'s a rape scene with a victim who\'s been duped into cooperation . \nyou don\'t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don\'t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don\'t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who\'s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she\'s known . \nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \nwhen nomi realizes she\'s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi\'s entire life . \nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she\'ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi\'s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi\'s decision . \ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who\'s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \ncristal is a talented dancer who\'s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn\'t need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom . "" \nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \nglenn plummer plays a dancer who\'s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \nplummer\'s character is the only one in the movie who\'s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he\'s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \nplummer\'s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \nsome of jost vacano\'s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi\'s character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \ni don\'t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \nbut don\'t go see it if you\'re not in a tough mood ; the only person it\'s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . \non life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you\'d enjoy meeting in person . \n'",1
"b'i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn\'t need a sequel . \nbeloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . \nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn\'t show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . \ntoy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney\'s standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . \nas someone who doesn\'t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that\'s because they\'re made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . \nfortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . \nlucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . \n ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film\'s elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house\'s new cachet in hollywood . ) \nvisually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . \nfortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . \nas before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child\'s absence . \nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy\'s life is to mean something to its owner . \none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . \nmost often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they\'re not even removed from their packaging . \nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you\'ll understand the attitudes of the collector\'s items that show up in this movie . \nsheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy\'s toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . \nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . \nthose anxieties are crystallized when andy\'s mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . \nand there\'s an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . \nthe rest of andy\'s toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . \nthat this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . \noperating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . \n ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) \nsometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . \nthere\'s somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . \nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . \n ( just don\'t ask why andy\'s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) \nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al\'s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? \nforget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . \nhere , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children\'s tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . \nin sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . \nsignificantly , the film\'s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . \nand toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . \nso toy story 2 joins the tradition of children\'s stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . \nwhat\'s really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar\'s a bug\'s life ) are kids\' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . \nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . \ni\'m not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next . \n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by john lasseter , colin brady , ash brannon , and lee unkrich written

"b'by now i figured i\'d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i\'m complaining . \nto call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement . \nthe paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock\'s lesser movies , turned out to be one i\'d missed . \nthis one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring . \nthe story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband . \nas mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world . \nto franz waxman\'s stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . \nstripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband . \n "" a brief skirmish , and you\'ll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial . \ngregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister . \n "" she\'s no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty . \n "" she\'s too fine a woman . "" \nhis attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) . \nunlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama . \ntypical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light . \nshe deflects her husband\'s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client . \nthe dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine\'s portrait nearby . \nin the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires . \nto the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs . paradine acquitted because , if mrs . paradine dies , his heart will go with her . \nif she is freed , he will be able to forget her . \nas part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr . paradine\'s valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships . \ncharles coburn plays anthony\'s legal partner , sir simon flaquer . \nand charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield . \nthis being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge\'s house not long before the case begins . \ncourt tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems . \none , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying . \none sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations . \nas the judge\'s wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film\'s only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit . \n ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? \nat 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case . \ndon\'t miss it . ) \nin the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom . \nthe great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first . \nwatch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial\'s action . \nas anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it . \nthe end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . \nthe paradine case runs 1 : 53 . \nthe picture is in black and white . \nit is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested . \n'",1
"b'though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there\'s something about elizabeth . . . that \nleft me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn\'t care about the characters . \nto me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about . \nand though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason . \nelizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying . \nbefore she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs . \nas a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england . \nthe film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life . \nmuch of the film deals with elizabeth\'s love for lord robert , a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen . \nthere is much ado about her lack of a husband , and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation . \nthe problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece , as love interests are such a character driven element . \ni didn\'t much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn\'t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials . \nthe cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen\'s most loyal advisor , sir francis , and attenborough as a well-meaning but old-fashioned lead council . \nwhy then , you must be asking , do i recommend elizabeth ? \nsimply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer . \nkapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side . \nthe light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches , cellars and castles in 16th century europe . \neach frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from windows . \nthe costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot . \nindeed , elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade , ranking with kundun and braveheart . \nwatch also for the incredibly "" godfather-esque "" mass murder scene . \nit made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films . \n'",1
"b'a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . \nit is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie "" fingers "" coyle ( mitchum ) . \nhe got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . \nhis current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn\'t think he could survive prison at his age . \nhe is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . \nhe could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . \nhe is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . \nthe masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager\'s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . \non one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . \ncoyle\'s best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . \nhe is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . \nwith the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . \nhe contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . \nthinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . \nbut foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . \nwarning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . \nthe bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . \nthe contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . \ncoyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , "" to be young like that and have his future , he\'s the greatest hockey player in the world . "" \ndillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . \nthis is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . \nthe city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . \nthere is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . \nmitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . \nit makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . \nmitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . \nbut in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . \n'",1
"b' "" idle hands "" is distasteful , crass and derivative . \nif an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness . \nplus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo . \nthe movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers . \nthe plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who\'s hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed . \nalong the way the hand kills anton\'s parents and his two best friends . \nthe friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them . \nthat is the level of this\'s atrocity\'s humor . \nthe movie treats death as a joke . \n "" idle hands "" is gruesome and morbid . \nthe performances are stereotypical and cartoonish . \ni realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen . \nit is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life . \nand i can only presume that the writers of "" idle hands , "" terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today\'s young people and their values in a satiric vein . \nhowever , it\'s hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people . \nwith the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as "" idle hands "" should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths . \n "" idle hands "" is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside . \nbut the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings . \nthe time is not right for this type of movie . \nand as far as "" idle hands "" goes , the time may never be right . \nthis is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema . \n'",0
"b'the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . \nit took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . \nmaybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . \nmy recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . \nas it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . \na big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . \nthe kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . \nand this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . \nbrain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . \nin typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . \ndoctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . \nthen , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . \nthe ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . \nat about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . \nthe best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . \nbut with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . \nstrangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . \nthe movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . \none of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . \nin the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . \nthe kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . \nthere are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . \n'",0
"b""now , lets first look into the history of shark films . \nthere was the unforgettable jaws . \nthe exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . \nnow , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones ! \nrussell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease . \nthe substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones . \nas sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure . \nwith the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days . \ngone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after . \nthis time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . \nso-so acting , expected in most of your average action film . \njackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines . \nll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films . \ndeep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer . \nit does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not \x05 humour ! \nits like jurassic park under water . \nnothing too stressful , pure entertainment . \nrenny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) . \n""",1
"b""humanities quest for knowledge never ends . \nso a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . \nthe party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . \nearly on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . \nthey agree to give him a ride to the next village . \nhe claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . \nvery soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . \nwe don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . \nshe just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . \nour heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . \nno wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . \nour anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . \nenjoy ! \nso much for the first attempt to catch her . \nbut who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? \nour villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . \ntoo bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . \none by one she goes after the others . \neric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . \nthe rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . \nhowever the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . \nwhenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . \nthe snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . \nher attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . \nmostly we don't see the act of devouring . \nbut she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . \nwhoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . \nmaybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . \nthe animatronics are somewhat more believable . \nbut that didn't work for the strangling scenes . \ndon't go see the movie for the f/x . \nthey are everything but up-to-date . \nthe viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . \nwe may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . \na well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . \nthe majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . \nwhat kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? \nhard to say . \nthis can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ? \nsee for yourself . \n""",0

its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . \nit\'s no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \n "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn\'t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . \nthe script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it\'s alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 ) . \ncohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director\'s chair after only a week\'s worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . \nhe was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . \nheffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . \nit shows in the final product . \ncohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . \nhe shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . \nthe movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron\'s background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . \nbut the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical . \nthe central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . \nbecause spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer\'s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . \nwe never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don\'t have hammer in them at all . \nconsequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane\'s storytelling is lost . \nthe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer\'s moral code is thrown to the wind . \ndespite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . \nthe title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . \nunlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . \nin this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . \nthe movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society\'s terms , but in any terms , especially his own . \nif anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . \nmaybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer\'s character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . \nthe blame for hammer\'s character can\'t be laid on assante\'s shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . \nspillane never once described hammer\'s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . \nof course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane\'s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963\'s "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . \nthe rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . \nwith the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in "" i , the jury "" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . \nmany of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on "" dallas "" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . \nmaybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it . \n'",0
"b' "" payback , "" brian helgeland\'s inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997\'s "" l . a . confidential "" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( "" conspiracy theory "" and "" lethal weapon 4 , "" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \nthe tagline for "" payback "" is , "" get ready to root for the bad guy , "" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \ni wouldn\'t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn\'t , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \njust because the protagonist , a "" bad guy , "" is played by mel gibson doesn\'t mean i will "" root for him , "" and i didn\'t . \nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \nsince none of the respectable actors in "" payback "" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . \'s "" ally mcbeal "" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \nunger , who made an impression in 1997\'s "" the game , "" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn\'t appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \nin the course of the 102-minute running time of "" payback , "" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \nand guess what ? \nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \n "" payback "" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \n'",0

"b""the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it's laughable . \nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n""",1
"b""while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . \nboth films consist of a predominately male cast . \nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \npaying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . \nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . \nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . \nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \nit doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . \none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \n""",1

up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\'s picture . \nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\'t dead yet ) . \ni sincerely hope that i\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\'s wage on this tripe . \neverything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \nthe script ( and let\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award . \nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\'t take itself so damn seriously . \nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \neverything is ugly and dark . \nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish "" . \nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . \nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . \nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . \nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . \nfor a scientist , this is very poor observation . \nlet\'s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \ni don\'t think iguana\'s have a habit of migrating . \n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \n4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it\'s suspension cables . \n5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? \nif so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . \n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can\'t catch you on foot . \n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \n11 . ) galapagos iguana\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \ndon\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of "" america\'s funniest home videos "" . \nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \nthe only common occurrence that doesn\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \nnow , i for one can\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of \'jurassic park "" , but with none of that film\'s suspense or tension . \nsuffice to say that , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . \nthis is a film that needed the hype . \nwith the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . \nif you\'ve seen the trailers , you\'ve seen the best parts . \nmy only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . \n . this film could be the next "" rocky horror "" . \nonly it\'s not funny ! \n'",0

"b'scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . \nal pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . \noliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . \nthe film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states . \nmany of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime . \nnearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry . \nalong with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field . \ntony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank\'s lover . \nof course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force . \nthis is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami . \ntony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him . \nno one can trust him , and basically , no one does . \nscarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino . \nalthough he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one . \nin fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) . \nanother element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity . \na figure tagged to the film boasts that the word "" fuck "" and it\'s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record . \nthe thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie . \nas odd as it sounds , it\'s true . \nin the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard . \n'",1

"b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\'connell . \nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . "" \nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \ndon\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\'s up to you to decide . \nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\'s skin . \nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \nwhen playing "" george "" in disney\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\'s , didn\'t get much personal attention . \nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \nthe mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \ni didn\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \n'",1
"b""capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \nhow come he didn't get it ? \nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \nit's all handwaving . \nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \n""",0
"b'old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches \nsoldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body . \njungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it\'s difficult to integrate both . \noften we\'ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung\'s magician , sit around imagining grand schemes . \nwithout the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams . \nwarriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy . \nthey don\'t care enough about anything to know what\'s worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle . \nthis dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies . \namerica during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers . \ntodd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype . \nchosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine . \nhis childhood is cruelty and competition . \nhe is indoctrinated with the big rules . \nnever question authority . \nwinning is everything . \nstrength beats knowledge . \na veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he\'s obsolete . \na new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger . \nleft for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he\'s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world . \nobviously our hero is still alive . \nhe finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health . \nwhen the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world . \nthey are the other good guys . \nthese lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons . \ntodd finds himself in the role of protector . \nwhat could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon . \nthe effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion . \nthe plot is old hat . \nwe don\'t get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers . \nhardly anything makes sense . \nthe film\'s science fares badly . \nwith all the remarkable advances we\'ve made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we\'re still stupid . \nafter conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away . \neven stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines . \nvirtually all the trash is vintage 1960 . \nthere is nothing in the story that is not predictable . \nthe first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him . \nit doesn\'t take a genius to foresee that her husband isn\'t going to be around much longer . \nis it a shock to find out that the film\'s climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? \nwho would you guess wins ? \nsome of the scenes would work if this were a comedy . \ntodd\'s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie\'s nipple poking through her thin blouse . \nlater as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion . \nsupposedly this clich ? isn\'t meant to be humorous . \ndastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash . \nresponsible for last year\'s quirky and visually enticing but problematic "" the fifth element "" , director paul anderson sees the film as "" shane "" in outer space . \nmaybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode . \nthe movie doesn\'t even work as an action film . \nthere is never a question as to the outcome . \nsomehow the new superior soldiers don\'t prove much of a match for todd . \nthe acting isn\'t anything to write home about . \nnielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim . \nrussell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it\'s not much of a challenge . \nuttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space . \ngary busey as todd\'s commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role . \neverything blows up and occasionally it looks cool . \nsometimes the sets are impressive . \nunfortunately "" occasionally "" and "" sometimes "" don\'t make a film . \nmost disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote "" blade runner "" , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made . \nsharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film . \npeoples says that this is not a "" blade runner "" sequel , but a "" sidequel "" that takes place in the same universe . \nalthough that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the "" blade runner "" replicants watch to pass time . \nperhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween . . . whatever \nyou\'d like it to be . ) \n'",0

"b""ahh yes . \nthe teenage romance . \nan attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . \nand with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . \nalong now comes `down to you' . \nthe folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . \nonly `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . \nit is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . \nthis is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . \nin strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . \nthey hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . \nfrom here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . \nthe plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . \nwell , only happen in the movies . \nfortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . \nfreddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . \nzak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . \nrounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . \neven the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . \nmaybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . \nas a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . \nperhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . \nthe jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . \nthe characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . \neven the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . \nthe one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . \nwhen this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . \nin order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . \n`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . \nno such luck with `down to you' . \nit's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . \nand at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . \nonly in the movies' . \n""",0

"b""the question isn't why has grease been reissued . \nthe answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . \nno , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? \nthe answer is not an easy one . \ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . \ntravolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . \nbut grease didn't break any new cinematic ground . \nit was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . \nwhat grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . \nok , let's not be a spoilsport . \ngrease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . \nit's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . \nhe could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . \ncinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . \nbetween grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . \ntwo reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . \ntoday , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . \ntoday's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . \nsecondly , a lack of talent . \nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \nif audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . \nperhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . \nat one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . \nso , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . \nlet grease be the word that sparks this revival . \n""",1

"b'absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . \nit is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . \none can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . \nnot only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . \ncontinually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . \ndetails essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . \noddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . \na masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . \nmarshall ) . \nwhile robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . \nthere , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . \ntheir game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . \nin self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . \nshe raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . \nthe man ? \nhe is the president of the united states of america . \nwhere does the film go wrong ? \nit cannot be the acting . \nclint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . \nthe cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . \neven the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . \nthe fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . \nwhile setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . \nnot one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . \nrather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . \nan example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . \npolice officers are everywhere , incognito of course . \nat the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . \nall three parties are unaware of each others presence . \nthis scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . \nhe will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . \nhowever , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . \nthe buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . \nten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . \nthe scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . \nparallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . \nthe daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . \nof course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . \nagain , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . \nhowever , trying is simply not enough ! \nthe second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . \neverything this film is not . \nhow could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? \nhow could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? \ni am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . \ndirector quentin tarantino once said : "" i can make a good movie out of any bad script . "" \ndirector clint eastwood obviously cannot . \n'",0
"b'when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \ncool . \n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \nthrough coal-mining . \nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . \nanother commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . \n'",1

"b""warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes \ndirector : luis mandoki \nscreenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) \ncast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage . \nreview by : geoff berkshire \ni'm not an overly cynical guy . \nthere have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years . \nhowever , i have my limits and i also have standards . \nthis brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day . \nthe story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . \nduring a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . \nthe letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . \nupon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . \nit turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . \nhe turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . \nthis is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . \nof course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . \nthis way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . \nthe discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . \nthere's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending . \na fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . \nthe actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . \nwell , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) . \nmessage in a bottle is one slow moving film . \nlast year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . \nthey also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . \nmessage in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . \ncostner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . \nthey also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . \nthe supporting players are given very little to do . \nthe reliable douglas is particularly wasted . \nold pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . \na confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . \nhowever , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . \nthe film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . \ngabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . \ncaleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . \ndo the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? \nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \n""",0
"b""-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n""",1

"b""the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is . \nhe wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . \ni think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people . \ni think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . \ni own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . \nin other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . \nit has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good . \nit also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . \nsince i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! \ni did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . \nno words can describe the dvd . \nin 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . \nnow in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis . \nthe person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . \nwhy is he stalking her ? \ncheck out halloween ii it explains it all . \non this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive . \nthe whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . \nnick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . \nwhat john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style . \nthe movie is flawless if not perfect . \nno other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will . \n'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . \ni just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . \n'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it's an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . \nsee 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then \nwatch it again ! \nreviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 . \n""",1
"b""the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent . \nin other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . \n54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered . \nthe difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view . \nchristopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark . \nhe keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists . \nthe movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot . \nhe is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur . \nhe's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs . \nmyers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling . \nat one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash . \nthe story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple . \nshades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever . \neventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land . \nhis looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous . \nshane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater . \nbut both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal . \nthe chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent . \n54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie . \nit's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance . \nit's sort of like the musical era it covers . \n""",0
"b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \nthe film is based upon the comic book series "" the flaming carrot "" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \n "" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , "" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and "" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \nthat is until they aquire "" invisible boy "" ( kel mitchell ) , and "" the bowler "" ( janeane garafalo ) and "" mr . splein "" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \none was paul reuben . \nno matter how disgusting or revolting "" mr . splein "" may be , you still can\'t help but laugh . \nit\' so incredibly moronic , it\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \ntheir parts were so limited , they\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \nit forgets about money making , because it\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\'s proceeders , and that\'s what works . \nstupid ? \nmaybe , but for once i\'m not disappointed . \nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \n'",1
"b'as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . \ni am befuddled by fight club . \nnow sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later . \nperhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time . \nperhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them . \nfight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former . \nmaybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold . \nbut if it is , i sure don ? t see it . \nedward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer . \nhis insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life . \nbut when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home . \nonce jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally . \nthey begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging . \nas the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days . \ni dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey . \nsuffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation . \nthis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table . \nbut with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? . \nnow , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today . \nadvertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed . \n ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . ) \nall of them play an important role . \nhow so ? \nwell , i can kinda just tell . \ni can ? t really put my finger on it . \nto say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news . \nis that bad for the world ? \nprobably . \nnot much room for social commentary there . \nwe all know that inter-office politics are just that . . . politics . \nso what was the point of all this ? \nthe film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were . \nall i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting . \n ( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good . \neven meatloaf is good . ) \nwhen you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself . \nnot them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer . \nfight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about . \nbut it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing . \nsure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films . \n'",0
"b'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \nit\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his "" attorney "" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \nit doesn\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\'re laughing , we\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important . \nnow it\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\'t seem to approve , doesn\'t do anything to stop it either . \nby the time this scene takes place , they don\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \nduke seems to realize at some level that he\'s become something he doesn\'t like , but he\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \nthere\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\'t usually very pleasant . \nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \ni\'m not sure if he\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \n'",1
"b' "" seven "" is one of the best mystery movies i\'ve ever seen . \nit\'s extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it\'s also quite fun . \nit\'s a serial killer mystery , but you don\'t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer . \nthe story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery . \nsomeone is murdering people who are offenders of "" the seven deadly sins . "" \na fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions . . . \ni could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much . \nwhat makes this film so unique is the characterization of the "" good guys "" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile . \nbrad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie . \nhowever , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn\'t get killed by the end ) . \nthere is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief . \nthis is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment . \nthe setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be . \nthe production design is superb , in the spirit of "" batman "" and "" the crow , "" this film embodies the gothic mood . \nthe way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! \nthe killer\'s victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don\'t have much to go on to solve the case . \nthey can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense . \nwe become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown . \nnot that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this . \nthe only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect . \nlet\'s just say it seems a little too "" mystery movie , "" or too convenient in other words . \nwhen they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues . \nthis is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story . \nif anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings . \ni don\'t have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . \nthere is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he\'s obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . \nwhat\'s even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film\'s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . \n "" seven "" is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man . \njohn doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of "" scum . "" \nbut as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice . \n'",1
"b'the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again . \nor go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir . \nor even -- god help me -- palmetto . \nalex proyas\'s new movie screams atmosphere . \ni screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater !

"" \nin this movie , no one is given anything to do . \nsewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn\'t remember anything , and plays it like . . . \num . . . \na man who doesn\'t remember anything . \nthe aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they\'re evil -- and there\'s a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . \nsutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he\'s in league with the aliens . \nto its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . \nwilliam hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . \njennifer connelly , playing sewell\'s love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . \nbut instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they\'re almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . \nthe problem with dark city is this : it\'s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . \nthe essence of film noir isn\'t , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner . \ndark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics . \ndark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic . \nit\'s an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere . \n'",0
"b'the formula is simple . \ntrap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . \nthese have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) . \nso , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? \n ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) \nperhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . \ndeep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . \ntreat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no \nquestions asked . \nthis time , however , they may have gone too far . \ntheir passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . \nand their cargo . . . let\'s \njust say it has very high explosive potential . \nwhat is the target of these thieves ? \nwhy , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . \nbut something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something \nancient and deadly . \nby the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . \nand now the creature senses fresh meat ! \nso , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . \nand the monster gets to pick them off one by one . \nfortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . \nwhy else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . \nif there\'s a more clarion call for unity , i don\'t know what it might be . \nit\'s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . \nthere are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . \nfor the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience\'s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . \n ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou\'s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) \ntreat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . \nbut while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . \nthe biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o\'connor\'s whining engine-boy , under finnegan\'s employ . \nhis constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . \nit\'s just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . \nas far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . \nthink back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . \nthey all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . \npart of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . \nthe tentacle monster in deep rising doesn\'t have a set of rules . . . \nor if it does , not a very good one . \nit merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . \nthe film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . \nit simply happens . \nthe action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . \nthe film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . \ndeep rising\'s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron\'s ( but can you really blame them ) . \nunfortunately , deep rising\'s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . \non the plus side , however , the film\'s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . \nperhaps you\'d be better off waiting for that one . \n'",0

"b'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \nsince \'dark city\' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg\'s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when \'the thirteenth floor\' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to \'the thirteenth floor\' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak\'s latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood\'s action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n\'the thirteenth floor\' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , \'the thirteenth floor\' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first "" download into simulation "" is impressive . \nit is the creator\'s first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone\'s identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone\'s fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \nfor others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \nat least that\'s how it is all beginning . \nbut when you\'re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \nwhat is thought ? \nwho are we ? \nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose\'s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about\'the thirteenth floor\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \'dark city\'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn\'t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in \'dark city\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \'dark city\' . \nwith this in mind , \'the thirteenth floor\' doesn\'t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n'",1
"b'there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . \nthe scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . \nto one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . \njakob , however , never stops moving . \nit\'s an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody\'s idea of a hero at the outset . \nhe is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . \nthe set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . \nafter a visit to a german commandant\'s office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . \nwhen he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . \nthe good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . \na private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . \nthis promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . \ni am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year . \ncompare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . \njakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he\'s struggling _not_ to craft them . \nwhen he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . \noh yes , and then there\'s that little girl . \nsome viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero\'s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren\'t problematic because they\'re familiar . \nthey\'re problematic because they\'re jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn\'t have been about cutesy relationships . \njakob\'s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . \nevery scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . \nit is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . \ndirector peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker\'s novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . \nthere are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it\'s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams\' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . \njakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . \nand after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . \n'",0

"b""swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . \nsteven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . \nand he knows a money making winner when he sees one . \nthe mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . \nhopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . \na fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . \nthe film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . \nhowever , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . \nbanderas motive ? \nto avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . \nwith the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . \nbanderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease . \nhopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . \nas the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . \nthe audience does hate them , which can't be bad . \ncatherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . \nthe chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . \nthere's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . \nthe director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . \nthe action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . \nthe cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . \nalthough the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment . \nhowever , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . \nit manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . \nscreenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . \nalthough they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . \nthere's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . \nthe main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . \nthis sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . \nhowever , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going . \nin the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . \nit suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . \nyou won't regret it . \n""",1
"b'films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they\'re about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there\'s never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid \'80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don\'t dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell\'s directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that\'s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london\'s east end . \nit\'s a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn\'t so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can\'t stomach . \ni don\'t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won\'t go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don\'t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit\'s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell\'s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) . \ndon\'t worry - it\'ll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell\'s appearance : it\'s certainly dark and bleak enough , and it\'s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn\'t completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don\'t say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs\' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould\'s secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn\'t half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n'",1
"b'disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . \nwhile it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . \nfa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it\'s \njust that she doesn\'t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . \nwhile most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . \nbut there is trouble on the horizon . \nthe evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . \nthe emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . \nthe only male in mulan\'s family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . \nmulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father\'s life . . . by \nsecretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . \nmulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . \nwong , singing : donny osmond ) . \nbut she\'s not alone in her tasks . . . in \ntypical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . \nmuch like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn\'t flow well with the rest of the more serious story . \nsure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . \nthe overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . \nbut , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . \nthe animation is on par with some of disney\'s best . \nthe story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . \nthe musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney\'s recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . \nat least , we\'re only subjected to four of them this time around . \nmulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . \nmost of the killing is off-screen and it\'s all highly depersonalized ( there\'s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi\'s mom ) . \nthere\'s nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . \nchildren will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . \nit\'s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . \nif the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . \ninstead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies . \n'",1
"b'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \nwashington provides much of the film\'s intensity and emotional power . \nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \nit makes your blood boil . \nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\'s close childhood friends . \nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake . "" \nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \nunfortunately , however , broderick\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \nthe film places too much weight on broderick\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of "" thirtysomething "" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \na couple of the movie\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \nthe regiment\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \n'",1
"b'the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\'s story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she\'s not easy ! "" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that\'ll do , donkey . \nthat\'ll do "" ) to "" the graduate . "" \nbut the lion\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! "" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it\'s a small world . "" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\'s diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages . \nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n'",1
"b""an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . \nyou may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . \nwhen i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . \nthe monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . \nall of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office . \nthe designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking . \nthe director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' \nthe writing behind this project is embarrassing . \nfor your amusement , i will explain the plot . \ndr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . \nas the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . \nwhen they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . \nkinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . \nthere is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! \n ( a far superior film in any league ) . \nyou will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . \nsylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . \nquestion : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? \nthe adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . \nit's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula . \ni also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . \nthe effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . \nthe only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' . \ni suppose they are . \ni can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . \nother instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . \nthere are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . \npeter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast . \nthen again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . \nmeanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . \ni would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . \ninstead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . \nor perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . \nanything to avoid this painful movie . \nthe final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . \nsequel ? \nplease have mercy . \n""",0
"b' "" jack frost , "" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . \nthis does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . \njack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn\'t spend nearly enough time with them . \nwhen he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . \nhalfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . \nswitch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack\'s death . \nwhen charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack\'s spirit . \njack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . \n "" frosty the snowman , "" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn\'t work at all . \nafter a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , "" jack frost , "" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . \nsince jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , "" what happens after you die ?

"b""in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \nwhich wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . \nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \nbut , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . \nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \n""",0
"b'ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . \nit\'s more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner\'s world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . \nthe movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . \nthe story is very minimal and basic . \nthere are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . \nthey are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . \nwhen they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . \ngordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus\' plans . \non the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . \nsounds great huh , well it\'s not . \nthe movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . \nthe jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film\'s many duds . \nthere is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . \nthe cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . \ni especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette\'s tag team partner is \'macho man\' randy savage . \nthey wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . \nthe other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . \nmcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . \nshe becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan\'s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . \nnow what didn\'t work in this movie ? \nthat would be the rest of it . \nthe flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . \nthe two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . \nit\'s not funny ; it\'s pathetic and brainless . \nthe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . \ni watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . \nthe main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . \nalso , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . \ni like wrestling . \ni watch it at home and laugh . \nit\'s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn\'t watch it . \nthis movie wasn\'t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . \nthe only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . \nthe funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . \nthe movie was too dim-witted to be funny . \nit is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . \na recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . \nthat movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . \nthe acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . \nnow that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . \nat least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . \nhe\'s in the funny parts of the film but there aren\'t enough to make him look good . \nthe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock\'s "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy "" . \nmartin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . \nscript is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . \na fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . \nat times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . \nthe wrestlers form alliances , go to people\'s houses and beat them up . \nit\'s utterly ridiculous . \nthe whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . \nthe movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . \nthe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . \nthe wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . \nif you\'re going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it\'s actually entertaining . \nthe wrestling is betters , they\'re funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . \noh and the girls are hotter . \nis this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?

"b'i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks . \ni loved the wedding singer . \nbut it gets worse . \nif i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . \n . \n . \nhell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i\'m bound to be lynched . \nwell lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . \nright away , you\'re ready to discount my review , aren\'t you ? \nyou\'re thinking that i can\'t possibly know what i\'m talking about . \nafter all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? \nwell , there\'s more . \n . \n . \ni actually got choked up , and more than once . \nyes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes . \nbut before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . \nthe wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so . \nbut when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn\'t exist for people like him . \nin the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character . \njulia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the "" miami vice "" loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn\'t seem all that interested . \nas the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he\'s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . \nit\'s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? \nthis isn\'t sleepless in seattle , but i\'d actually compare it to that before i\'d compare it to happy gilmore . \nwhile the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way . \nsandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . \nbarrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple . \none scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears . \nunfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it\'s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i\'m encouraging everyone to go see it . \nin fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar . \nthe 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . \nsandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . \nwhile the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars . \nit\'s hilarious , and it\'s touching . \nit\'s got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . \nthis is one to see again and again . \nis it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? \nmy "" magic 8-ball "" predicts it is certain . \n'",1
"b""stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . \nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . \nbased on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . \nvisiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . \nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . \nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . \nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . \nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \nthe film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . \nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \nasia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \nit's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . \nactive since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \nit's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \nit's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \nthis is a long welcome reunion . \nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . \n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . \n""",1

"b""the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it's a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n""",1
"b'seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \nwatching "" flubber "" really clinched this idea for me , because it\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \nphillip\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\'s disease - isn\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\'s forgotten . \nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\'s ideas , but his woman too . \nwhat\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \nit\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \nbut it\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \nit\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , "" i think they might be cheating , "" to which the referee replies , "" there\'s no rules about jumping too high . "" \n "" predictable "" doesn\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \nand it\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\'s the way it\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \ni\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \nit\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about "" flubber "" is . \nthe only original element the film has is the world\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\'t . \n'",0

\nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \ni don\'t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn\'t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \ni\'ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \nthen we have the cast . \nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \nsadly , his acting doesn\'t come close to making up for his looks . \nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn\'t surprise you . \nmeyer\'s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \nhey , it a sexist movie , so i\'m writing a sexist review . \nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \ni sound like i\'m writing a review in a porn magazine . \nbut hey , i\'ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d\'s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \nproceed with extreme caution . \n'",0
"b'call me crazy , but i don\'t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . \na good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . \nan utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg\'s best work , no . \npersonally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn\'t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler\'s list and the indiana jones movies . \ni\'m guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn\'t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . \nall lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . \nthe difference is , it\'s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon\'s chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it\'s damn hard to sit and eat reese\'s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . \nand believe me , there\'s plenty of it . \na 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . \nlives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . \ncut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . \none woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . \ni guess it\'s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . \nthat way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . \none good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it\'s a mission designed to make the army look good . \nthey question the worth of risking eight soldiers\' lives to save one , and hanks\' character admits he doesn\'t give a damn about ryan ; he\'s just following orders . \nif this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . \nthere\'d be a phony , "" let\'s go get that boy , gosh darn it ! "" \nattitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . \nby doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . \nit makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . \nthe movie\'s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . \nhanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . \nit\'s not that way for long . \nedward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn\'t available , is the impulsive one . \njeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . \nnone of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg\'s obvious intention . \ni wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours\' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? \nthere are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson\'s company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it\'s the wrong ryan . \nand of course the movie\'s far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn\'t available ) . \nthat\'s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . \nsaving private ryan is worth your time , but it\'s definitely no schindler\'s list . \nthe battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren\'t . \nthe movie\'s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , "" tell me i\'ve led a good life . \ntell me i\'m a good man . "" \nspielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . \nmuch more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks\' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they\'re doing by pretending they\'re playing poker . \nthis while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . \nby not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . \nand even if it\'s not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there . \n'",1
"b'from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . \nhc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we\'re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who\'s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . \nnice to see you , jim . \nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \none entry was definitely enough , and i\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \nit\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \ni should also mention that this movie likely won\'t play all that well in cleveland . \nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \nactually , most of the action involves the twins\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \nleading off this inning is john warren . \nhe steps into the batter\'s box and takes kent\'s pitch low for ball one . \nwh : so , the story\'s strictly minor league , right ? \nwhat\'s it about ? \njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show . "" \nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\' overachieving group against huff\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \nwh : can we guess who wins ? \njb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you\'ve already seen the box score . \non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \nthey\'re not just boring ; they\'re lackluster . \nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they\'ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \n1 and 1 . \nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \njb : not one , from start to finish . \ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \nthe two sequels haven\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \neven bob uecker\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \nhc : here\'s the 1-1 pitch . \nlooooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! \nthe count goes to 1 and 2 . \nwh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? \njb : yes . \nthere aren\'t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \nbut i\'d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \nwh : it\'s nice to see old friends one more time , isn\'t it ? \nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \nthere aren\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \nthey have no depth . \nnotable absences include tom berenger\'s veteran and charlie sheen\'s "" wild thing . "" \nwe don\'t really miss them , though . \nhc : breaking ball , low and outside . \n2 and 2 . \nwh : so you\'re saying that we should give this one a miss ? \njb : that\'s right . \nto use baseball terminology , it\'s a three-pitch strikeout . \nif you\'re looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . \nactually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . \neven the minor league seasons are already underway . \ndon\'t bother with major league : back to the minors . \nit\'s a wretched time- waster . \nwh : thanks for the advice . \njb : you\'re welcome . \nhc : and here\'s the 2-2 pitch . \nfouled back , right into this booth . \nhey , jim , heads up ! \noops . \nsomebody better get him some ice for that . \nhe may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . \nodd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . \nanyway , back to the action on the field ? \n'",0
"b'synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . \nthe brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . \nmeanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . \ncomments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? \nit\'s hard to speculate . \nmost of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . \nin case you haven\'t picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel "" thriller "" ( i use the term "" thriller "" loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . \nthe plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . \nwriting a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . \nthere\'s really not much to say . \nthe acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . \nmost humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist\'s agent . \nhe is so horrible in this role that one can\'t help but be amused . \nthe plot sucks . \nnearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . \nthe dialogue stinks . \na loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn\'t need to know . \neverything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . \nas the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being "" assistsant to foley artist .

"b""vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . \nthe house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . \nwhile the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . \nthat is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . \nbut it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . \nthen there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . \nthe plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . \nand that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . \nthis could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . \nwhat carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . \nthere is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . \nanything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . \nthis has not always been carpenter's style . \nhis 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question . \njack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows . \nin the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . \nnow crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . \nto make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . \nmeanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . \nif this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is . \nthe same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . \nbut carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them . \njust about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . \nfundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? \nthe answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . \nnow if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . \nwoods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . \nbut carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing . \nwhile his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . \nwoods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . \nthat is not his style and it just does not work very well . \nthere are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . \nin one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . \none female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . \nas the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . \none also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . \nthese vampires do not maintain a low profile . \nthere are arguably logical flaws in the film . \nthere is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . \nit would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . \ni suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . \nwhile i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nperhaps i will read the book . \n""",0
"b'violence is bad . \nviolence is ugly . \nviolence breeds yet more violence . \nkids , don\'t try this at home . \nthis weighty message isn\'t the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it\'s certainly one of the largest . \nwritten , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles . \n ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . ) \nif you piss a "" family "" member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs . \na definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another . \nit would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from . \nunfortunately the film doesn\'t give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano\'s earlier work . \nthere are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what . \nthen there\'s a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family . \ngranted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn\'t make a lot of sense . \ninstead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again . \nthe consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning . \nthere are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose . \nall of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend . \nhe barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away . \nanother missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes . \nthough slow moving , brother does have good elements . \nthe action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch . \nsome of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for . \nthe actors would be more enticing if they had more to do . \nshirase\'s ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto\'s quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination . \ntheir moments together or apart steal the rest of the show . \nalso to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism . \na life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash . \nsure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily . \nit\'s a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up . \n'",0

"b' "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\'s shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as "" casablanca without heroes "" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n "" the tailor of panama "" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n'",1

"b""martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . \nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . \narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \nthe film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . \nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . \nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \n""",1

"" \nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \nanother of burton\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\'s gen . thade . \nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring . \nthat is the famous line heston\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\'s terrible secret . \nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \nit is a masterful turn . \nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can\'t we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king . \nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \nburton\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \nthe movie\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \nhe comes close , but falls short . \notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \n'",1

"" \nshe must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . \nthe richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . \nalthough some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . \nyes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn\'t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . \nthis delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . \nduring the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . \nfirst , he\'s an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . \nnext , he\'s 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . \nwhen the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . \nwilliam is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . \nwilliam has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . \nkerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . \nnicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . \nthe father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . \nhis wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . \nrounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . \nas the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . \nthe director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . \nhe takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . \nrosmary\'s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . \nas much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . \nin one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . \nalthough he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . \na woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . \nwith absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . \ndusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . \nall of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . \nthe film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . \nthis causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . \nin the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . \neven here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . \nthe ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . \nthe hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . \nit is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature . \n'",1
"b'adam sandler isn\'t known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he\'s still a really funny guy . \nmost of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . \nbig daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler\'s comic performance , and it\'s a miserable failure . \nsandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . \nas one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say "" good-bye "" to one another ; in addition , there\'s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . \nthere\'s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny . \n'",0
"b'the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . \none particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . \nunder the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . \nthe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . \nin any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . \nalmost at the very beginning of the general\'s daughter , we see a general\'s motorcade passing a work detail . \neveryone salutes . \nit looked impressive , but it just wasn\'t right . \nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn\'t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . \nin fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . \nwhat results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn\'t right . \nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . \npaul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army\'s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . \nprior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn\'t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he\'s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . \nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we\'ll just say that it involves propellers ) . \nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general\'s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base\'s training ranges . \nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . \nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . \nit gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he\'s a little cocky . \ndoes the arms subplot turn up later ? \nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \nthe answer : it looked cool . \nor how about the "" atmosphere "" ? \nthe beginning of the general\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\'t matter , for when the film\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \nas i\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i\'ve ever heard . \nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \nboth characters are protagonists , but it\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . "" \ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\'s aide , colonel fowler . \ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \na far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can\'t help but think he was acting from west\'s direction . \na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\'t overacting . \ni haven\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \nevery time we\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \nwould\'ve been over in a half hour . \nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \nthey both seem kind of happy . \nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \n'",0
"b'in my opinion , a movie reviewer\'s most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . \nbut with soul survivors , i\'m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . \nhowever , protocol forces me to do otherwise . \nsoul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . \nparty girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . \nmatt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . \ndriving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . \nsean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . \nas cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . \nalong with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . \nannabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass\'s visions . \nshe has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . \nrarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . \nin his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . \nwhen the movie\'s camerawork isn\'t pedestrian , it\'s clich ? d . \ncarpenter\'s need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . \nwe already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? \nand the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . \ncarpenter\'s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . \nthis is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . \nthe second lamest device , of course , is the , "" oh , it was all a dream "" resolution . \nand guess what ? \nthis movie has both ! \nnot that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . \nsince there\'s no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . \nthat\'s a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . \ncarpenter can\'t even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . \n[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . \n-ed . ] \nwhen sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . \nand when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they\'re fully clothed . \nregardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . \nwhy wouldn\'t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? \nwhy would they shower in their clothes ? \nwhat if they weren\'t covered in latex paint ? \nthe cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . \ni felt sorry for affleck , who i\'ve liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . \ndushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . \nas for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . \nand i\'m not even getting into luke wilson\'s role as a priest . \nat least he\'s friends with wes anderson . \nbottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . \n'",0
"b'movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . \ni originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in \'95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . \nwe need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . \nthis picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . \nthe only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . \nso , it does indeed have some plusses . . . \nin fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . \nand her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . \nthis character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ?

\nwho cares ! \nultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . \neveryone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . \nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . \neveryone\'s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . \nit\'s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . \nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn\'t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?

"b'are you like me ? \ndo you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt\'s ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? \nwell if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end . \naaaaaaaahhhh . . . \nplot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill . \ncritique : this would be a good movie if it wasn\'t for the fact that it\'s got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special . \nand i\'m being nice ! \nhow junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit . \nthe only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan\'s character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot . \nwow . . . how \ndeep . \nof course , the same christmas tune that\'s played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build "" bonds "" among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars . \nstop me . . . i\'m \ngonna cry again ! \nthis film is a mess . \nthe characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an "" emotional "" moment about movie stars from the 50s . \nadmittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film . \nmeg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she\'s in . \nenough already ! \nand diane keaton must\'ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best . \nneither one convinced in "" emotional "" scenes . \ngranted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that\'s probably where my rating of three points comes from . \nall in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you\'re one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( "" oh no , please don\'t get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) . \nugh . \ni suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something ! \nthat\'ll teach \'em to mess with you ! \noh and incidentally , mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there ! \nthen again . . . maybe \nyou\'ll like it . \n : ) \n'",0
"b'titantic , writer and director james cameron\'s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \nif you\'ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world\'s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she\'d never notice the length . \namazingly , he was right . \ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn\'t suffer because of it . \nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world\'s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams . "" \nthe necklace\'s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\'s supercilious put-downs . \nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \npeter lamont\'s sets are more than authentic . \none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \nit then shifts to the ship\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \nwhat a lark . \nwe\'ve struck an iceberg . \nnow let\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \nthe ship\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \n "" it\'s good-bye for a little while , "" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \n "" this boat\'s for mommies and children . \nthere\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies .

"b'by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it\'s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . \naction lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . \naudience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film\'s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . \nsomewhere out there , maybe there\'s a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere\'s dubious charms , but i\'m not among them . \ni sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it\'s hard to understand why the rights were optioned . \nsphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . \nwith expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , \nsomething this bad can\'t help but look even worse . \nthe last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year\'s batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . \nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron\'s the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . \nscience and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere\'s first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . \nattempts at characterization fall apart . \nintelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . \nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . \nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . \nthis is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . \ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . \nthere is some promise , but it\'s all in the setup . \nwe\'re introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . \nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . \non the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . \ntogether , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . \nfor a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . \nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . \nthen , right around the one-hour mark ( that\'s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever\'s left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . \nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting . "" \nadditionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who\'s more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don\'t develop much of a rooting interest . \nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . \nwhat about that a-list cast ? \nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn\'t a person ; he\'s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \ndustin hoffman isn\'t lively or particularly good -- it\'s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \nthen there\'s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere\'s lengthy pre-production phase ) . \nif that\'s the case , forgiveness is granted . \ni\'m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton\'s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year\'s cinematic wasteland . \nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \n'",0
"b""in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n""",1

"b'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\'s big , expensive and soulless . \nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\'s script . \nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \nthis is jodie foster\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \nshe\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because "" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father , have i offended you in some way ? \nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\'s prejudices . \nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\'s younger daughters dies . \nit\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \ni\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \ni do not doubt tennant\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \nfoster\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \n'",0

"b'sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . \nit\'s not the time or the distance , it\'s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . \nyet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . \nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern . \nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . \nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . \nbut kate\'s "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . \nher father lost all of her family\'s money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . \nnaturally , a newspaper writer\'s wages don\'t count as "" rich .

"" \nis lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker\'s "" dracula "" . \nthe british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania . \nhe leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock\'s secret--he\'s a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love . \nin addition to schreck\'s performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding . \narrow video\'s digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin . \nthe cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below . \ntrouble is , murnau\'s monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn\'t a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie . \nthis sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted . \nadditionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau\'s film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire . \nthat said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself . \nthe original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we\'re still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image . \nbut at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu\'s waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) . \nthe title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch . \n ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! ) \nthe score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for . \nwhen our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock\'s castle , we hear a well-timed "" now you\'re dead ! "" \nfrom lead singer peter steele . \ndavid carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film . \nafter the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest "" black no . 1 "" . \nof course , "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but "" mina "" --as bram stoker called her--in hutter\'s letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from . \ncoppola\'s 1992 "" bram stoker\'s dracula "" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau\'s masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn\'t thieve was the original\'s abstract charms . \nthis latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored "" metropolis "" a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks . \n'",1
"b'i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner \x16 and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . \nbut if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . \nor more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . \nthis is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor \x16 but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . \nif a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . \nalthough gere\x12s performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect \x16 and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . \nthis is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . \nin red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear \x16 bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . \nit is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . \nit doesn\x12t take long from the film\x12s beginning for jack moore\x12s charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room \x16 drunk and cheerful . \nyet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch . \nhe is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison . \nhis cell , food and rights \x16 all terrible . \nnow trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder . \njack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that \x13they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family . \x14 \nas the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous \x16 ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered . \nred corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit you\x12re way through all of its minutes . \nwhat should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act . \nthis is not to say that the film does not have its moments \x16 there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created \x16 telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . \nbut what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place \x16 perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . \nif you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . \nit is upon the film\x12s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . \nif that wasn\x12t bad enough , red corner\x12s dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . \nshen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . \ntaking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . \nalthough it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the film\x12s main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isn\x12t that meritorious anyway . \nwhilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again . \nmartin vail\x05where are you ? \n'",0
"b'mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . \nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \nsomething else is what he did . \nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \nshe does not know who the woman is . \nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \nhe just chooses not to . \nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \ni have rated this film fairly low . \nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \n'",0
"b'if you don\'t think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it\'s even less funny . \nby the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld . \nis the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ? \n ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler\'s rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you\'re thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . ) \n1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain . \nhow will loveless accomplish this ? \nwell , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course . \nbosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train . \n ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . ) \nracial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie\'s "" hip "" attitude toward the black thing . \n ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a "" nigger "" before that person can finish speaking the word . \nsuper . ) \nat any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she\'s a walking dress-up toy . \n ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . ) \njim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of "" the fresh prince of bel-air "" demonstrate . \nsmith\'s a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn\'t start out a hero . \nin wild wild west he\'s required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i\'m not sure any living performer could pull off . \nsmith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging . \nwhat attracted sonnenfeld to this material ? \nthis isn\'t the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it\'s the first big stinker of his career as a director . \nwild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he\'s too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic . \n ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops \nhim onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . ) \nwild wild west\'s bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling\'s all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant "" his master\'s voice "" joke , are all part of the film\'s first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second . \nwhen , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale . \n'",0
"b' "" . . . because i\'m a scientist . \nthat\'s what we do ! "" \n--- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . \nalright folks , stop me if you\'ve heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal\'s field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . \noh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . \nsound familiar ? \nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats . \ndina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . \nwith the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton\'s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . \ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \nthere\'s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \nthis film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it\'s good "" level and borders on the downright insane . \nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer\'s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she\'s nice to look at for an hour and a half . \nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what\'s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon\'s . \nhe is relegated to the "" i\'m not sticking around here ! "" \ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \nanyone who can\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \neven if he hadn\'t been the villain in just about every film he\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \nif the plot doesn\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \na government official blows off shelia\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\'s dogma ) . \nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \nbeing able to see the puppeteer\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\'t say you haven\'t been warned . \ntrust me when i say that it\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \nshe\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \n'",0

"b""i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze . \ni liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) . \ni typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash . \nwild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen . \nit's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards . \ncriticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic . \nwild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies . \ni must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal . \ni imagine that this shows . \nit's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known . \ni thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here . \ni'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida . \nin blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \nkelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges . \nall of this happens fairly early in the film . \nand right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted . \ni was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked . \nwild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks . \ni remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers . \ni'd give the preview four stars . \nit made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since . \nover the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong . \nthe preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets . \nbut i'm not here to talk about the preview . \ni'm here to talk about denise richards . \nnow , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can . \nof course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and \nflawless body . . . but \ni thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) . \nno , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film . \nthis mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future . \nthe other actors are good , too . \ndillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) . \nbacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer . \nneve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex . \nfor a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived . \nthat's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film . \neach scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist . \nthere isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful . \ni loved it . \n""",1
"b'sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . \nsometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . \ni saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . \nsurprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . \nbut by the attentiveness of the crowd i\'d say they were won over - as was i . i can\'t tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . \ntime alone will make that call . \nbut by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank\'s side . \nwe were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . \nthat we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . \nthe truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . \nunless you\'re under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . \ncarrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner\'s idea of the perfect american small town . \ntruman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . \nthere is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . \nbut then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . \nthis curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world\'s biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world\'s most popular television program . \nwhat makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . \nthe soundstage , we\'re told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space . "" \ntruman\'s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . \nweir cuts the film so we\'re never quite sure if we\'re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show\'s omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven\'s sky . \nthe second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . \nhis best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . \nhis wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . \nhe sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . \none wonders why he didn\'t pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they\'re presented . "" \nnevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . \nthis convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . \nby underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . \nthere is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i\'d gladly step in front of a bus for you . "" \nbut that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . \nthe abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we\'re on his side . \nthe truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven\'t we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? \nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \nwhat does god really think of us ? \ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn\'t try to be . \nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \n'",1
"b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \ni\'m happy to say that there\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \nearl brown ) , who\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \nit seems warren\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\'t seen since that fateful day . \nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \nthere\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\' last two films ) they almost all work . \ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \none minute you\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\'s apartment . \none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \nted\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\'t always work out . \nit\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \nactually , i\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late \'92/early \'93 . \nlike "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\'s cancellation . \ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\'t change , and you know , it\'s really true . \nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \nmaybe they live in dick clark\'s pool house . \nanyway , here\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\'s heart . \nthe supporting performances are also good . \nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \nlin shae , who plays mary\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \nlee evans , as mary\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \nit\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there\'s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . \n'",1
"b'albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time . \nwith a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way . \nwhile this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor . \nin albert brook\'s latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who\'s losing his edge , as his business partners say . \nin desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past . \nhe asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career . \nso brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment . \nthe real punch line however , doesn\'t come until the end . \nit really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? \nthe idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner . \nspeaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter . \nevery time he graces the screen , i can\'t help but start laughing . \nalbert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character . \nthe real problem with the film lies with sharon stone . \nshe wasn\'t likeable at all . \nbrooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through . \nin a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak . \nluckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone\'s mishap . \nit was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy . \non a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook\'s wife . \nshe is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she\'s in . \nthe funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese . \ni mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary . \nit was just plain hilarious . \nit just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas . \nbrilliant move by brooks . \nas i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it\'s proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before . \nunlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that\'s desperate for jokes , it\'s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood . \n "" bowfinger "" had it\'s moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but "" the muse "" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour . \nby the end of the film , you\'re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it . \nfor once i\'m not fully disappointed , because the film didn\'t slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws . \nthumbs up to brooks for his brave effort . \ni think he\'ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future . \n'",1
"b'in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn\'t stupid . \nfrom that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years . \nthe result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist . \nthe story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen . \nspecial investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills "" verbal "" kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims . \nkujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead . \nkint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city . \nalong with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible . \ntogether they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "" new york\'s finest taxi service "" --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins . \nwhat follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze . \nthe film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you\'ll ever spend in a movie theater . \nthe cast is exceptional . \npalminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there . \nbyrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster . \ndel toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can\'t understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny . \nbaldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm . \npollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor . \nhowever , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey . \nspacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze . \nspacey\'s performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years . \nverbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy . \nthe film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes . \nwhat this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least . \nthe revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous . \nyou have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do . \nkudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle . \nmcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb . \nwithout furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end . \nwe do . \nthis might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created . \nkudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score . \nthey both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending . \nthere are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . \nhowever , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . \nif you haven\'t seen the movie , rent it . \nwatch it . \nthen rewind the tape , and watch it again . \ntrust me , you\'ll be amazed . \n'",1

"b'a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . \nit turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . \nthough it\'s a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . \nit\'s made for the gentle art-house set , those who don\'t want something too disturbing to think about . \nit\'s about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he\'s threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer . \nshe meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs . \nthe fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband\'s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet . \nshe now wants her own identity and her independence . \nthe film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . \nthe film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . \nit\'s set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni . \nshe later meets him as her hubby\'s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel . \nalec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni . \nthe publisher is proud that he\'s a mamma\'s boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions . \nhe has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : "" if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "" \nthe only thing that couldn\'t be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . \nthe mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . \nshe soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni . \nwhen she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did . \nit ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . \na business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle . \n'",0
"b'i\'m guessing -- and from the available evidence , it\'s not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . \nif so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . \nit has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors\' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee . \nthat left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . \nand you could just smell the disaster brewing . \nif you\'re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you\'ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . \nostensibly , it\'s a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) . \nwhen the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called "" an alan smithee film "" -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it . \namong the parties interviewed are the film\'s producer james edmunds ( ryan o\'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them . \nit\'s bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . \nwhat makes it even worse is eszterhas\' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . \nmichael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas\' stock-in-trade . \nthe reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . \nby the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as "" bad a-- "" and "" badder a-- "" , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified . \nthose documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what\'s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . \nnot content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . \nthe producer is a "" liar "" who "" slept in the white house ; "" the media are "" maggots "" and "" leeches "" working for publications like "" the new york slimes "" and "" newsleak "" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don\'t miss the joke ) . \nit doesn\'t even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation . \nthis is a petulant schoolboy\'s idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . \nthe last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . \nperhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . \npity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven "" satire "" of excess and ego . \nit\'s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . \notherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees . \n'",0
"b""with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . \nwith early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . \nhowever , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . \nthis $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . \nconsidering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . \nthe film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . \nhowever , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . \nalong with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) \nthey investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . \nunfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . \nthe film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . \nthe film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . \nthe actors and directing don't help , either . \nhoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . \nstone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . \nthe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . \nbut he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . \nthe same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . \nthe director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . \nthe drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) \nthe writing doesn't help much , either . \nalthough crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . \nthe speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . \npractically every line is just stating the obvious . \nnone of it is smart . \nalso , where the hell did the budget go ? \nthe sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess . \nthere's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . \ni assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . \nbut the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . \nfinally , the film has no idea what genre to be . \nlevison can't handle his own plot . \nit leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . \nand , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) \nit's not all that bad though . \nthe plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit . \nbut overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . \nnot really worth seeing . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock \n""",0
"b""curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . \nto be specific , let me give you an example . \ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . \non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \nour film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \nthe killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \none particularly striking m . o . \non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \nno points for guessing what they do . \nher workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . \nthere's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \ngabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . \nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . \nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \njones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . \nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \nit's a great performance . \nreb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \nof course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \nit'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \n""",1
"b'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \ni must admit , no doubt\'s single "" new "" is quite catchy . \nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \nthe result ? \na movie that\'s just as good as that song , really . \nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \nreally , it\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \nthink of it as a , well , ending . \nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \nhowever , it\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\'t . \n'",1
"b'written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni \ndirected by terry gilliam \ni\'ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . \ndropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . \nthen there\'s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . \nmushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . \nacid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . \nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . \nfull of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson\'s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . \nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . \nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney\'s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . \noperating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr . \ngonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . \nthey terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . \nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . \ndr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane\'s "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax . \nand these guys don\'t just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . \nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . \nthompson\'s book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . \nit simultaneously exposed the 60\'s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . \npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson\'s message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . \nit\'s a cheech and chong movie . \nyou\'re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . \nthere\'s nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . \nthis is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . \nthere are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . \nbut to what end ? \nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \nbut you\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\'s dialogue . \nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \nit\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \nsid and nancy , cox\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \nit doesn\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\'t work as broad comedy . \nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \nbut i don\'t want to be too hard on it . \nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \n'",0
"b'seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds ) \npaul verhoeven\'s last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . \nit stank . \nstarship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . \nit stinks . \nnobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here\'s a brief synopsis anyway . \nsome friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy . \nafter one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared . \nthis involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs\' planet . \nmuch carnage ensues . \nthe troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call . \nmore carnage ensues . \nafter being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a "" brain bug "" which is believed to be controlling the aliens\' battle plans ( look , i didn\'t write this , ok ? ) . \nyet more carnage ensues . \nget the picture ? \ninterspersed throughout all this are brief "" ads "" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven\'s robocop . \nthere are many problems with starship troopers . \nthe plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly . \nharris ( star of tv\'s doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a "" brain bug "" later on . \nin addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 . \nthe characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it\'s ok because she got to sleep with rico . \ni had hoped that verhoeven\'s use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him . \nthe dialogue is embarassing and isn\'t helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) . \nfinally , the fake "" ads "" become a nuisance . \nalthough they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect . \nsome people will say all of that\'s irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes . \nso what about those battle scenes ? \nwell , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs . \nand people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways . \nbut this is my problem . \nthe entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards\' character vomits on-screen ) . \nverhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly . \nwhile robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features . \nwhen the brain bug sucks out a character\'s brain near the end of the film , it\'s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us . \nthis film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 . \n'",0
"b' * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * * \nthe previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them . \nthe ridley scott\'s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . \njames cameron\'s aliens was much more of an action film . \nand i liked each film separately for which it was . \nnow alien 3 is out . \nand it is it\'s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . \nunlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . \nthis is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . \nthe survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . \nthe climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . \nin the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . \nthis vessel crash lands on fury 109 . \neveryone in the vessel is killed , except ripley . \nthe facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash . \nfury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison . \nwhen closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet . \nall the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years . \nripley\'s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates . \nas for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner\'s sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet . \nbeing an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons . \nso the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own . \ni will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . \nthe alien is loose and no one believes ripley\'s outstanding story . \nshe finds comfort in the arms of the colony\'s doctor . \nyes , after 57 years ripley has sex . \nit is not gratuitous , in fact , we don\'t even see them kiss , but it is just as well . \na sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film . \nthere is a lot more gore in alien 3 . \nin fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . \nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! \ni won\'t say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . \nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . \nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . \nthe rest of the cast is also quite good . \nnotably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . \nalien 3 has a very distinct look . \nthis is due largely to its director , david fincher . \nmr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . \nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before . \nfor mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . \nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . \nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in . \nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner\'s aliens ) . \nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . \nthis is a great score . \nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good . \nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . \ni will not ruin the ending for you . \ngo see the film . \ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . \nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . \nand when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . \n'",1
"b' ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film\'s climax ; the election , of course ) \nwe see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he\'s been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they\'ve demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . \nand yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \nno matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she\'s the real threat . \nabout to give in , and divulge that she\'s won by only a lone vote , broderick\'s mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy\'s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , \'no\' . \nthe fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \nshe can\'t go higher than him . \nhe won\'t allow it . \nand what\'s amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \nit\'s like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers\' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \nand it\'s amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it\'s happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \nit\'s with mandy barnett\'s "" if you\'ll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \nsexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne\'s satire , or its success . \nit also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \nsatire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \nit\'s a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \npayne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \nwe sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \nminus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller\'s day off "" . \nwhatever . \n'",1

' \nwith these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . \nmade into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . \nso , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? \nwith that out of the way , let me say this . \nthis film is bad . \nthis film is really , really bad . \nyet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . \nwith all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . \nstill , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . \nagreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . \nperiod . \nrazor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . \nthe film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . \nbut aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions . \nthat is , unless that is intentional . \nrazor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . \nyou can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . \nyou'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . \nyou'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . \nand then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . \nthe film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story . \nbut in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . \nas much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . \nalmost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . \nwhile this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies . \n""",1
"b""warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . \nthe one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . \ntrailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . \ncarrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . \nace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . \nhe may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . \nthe opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . \n ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . \nhint : it sounds like splat . ) \nthe plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . \nwith his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . \nthe rest of the film is just more of the same . \nsure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? \nwriter and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . \ninstead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny . \nthe better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . \nthough an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . \nthe script is virtually devoid of wit . \ntribal mask jokes ? \njerry lewis cameos ? \nforget it . \nif anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge . \njust how long * can * they keep a straight face ? \n""",0
"b""in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \nin the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \nthere's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . \njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . \nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . \njoe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . \nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \nmark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \nthe script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' \nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \n""",1
"b""fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . \ntragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . \nmost of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . \nthose two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . \nunfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . \nsadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . \non the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . \none of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . \nin the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . \nthat movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . \nunfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . \ndeath wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . \nbefore the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . \nkersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . \nbronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . \nalthough bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . \nthe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . \non the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . \nunfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . \nthe big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . \nin short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . \n ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . \n""",0
"b'i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . \nthe problem is , i can\'t remember them as i write this review . \nthat\'s not a good sign . \nin booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can\'t really describe , because i don\'t know that much about him . \ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn\'t like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . \nbunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz\'s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . \nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it\'s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki\'s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . \nto make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki\'s obsession with safe sex . \nfirst she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . \noh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . \nback to the store . \nnow they\'ve got to get dental dams , or there\'ll be no foreplay . \nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? \nnikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she\'d better be making these demands , too . \ntalk about coitus interruptus . \nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . \nthe difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . \nin this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! \nat the extreme . \nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . \nit is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . \nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) \ndoes not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . \nfor instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . \nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone\'s surprise . \nhowever , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . \nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . \nif , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung-fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . \nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . \nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . \nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . \nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? \nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? \nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn\'t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? \nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . \na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . \nsome movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character\'s pattern of speech . \nother films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . \nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn\'t work . \nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . \nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . \nthe chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . \nthis is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . \nit\'s too bad that the core of the film isn\'t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . \ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review . \n'",0

"b""there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . \none is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . \ntwo is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . \nto wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . \na science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . \nsci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . \nbattlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . \nhere's the `plot . ' \nthe year is 3000 . \nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons .

"b'what\'s shocking about "" carlito\'s way "" is how good it is . \nhaving gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino\'s previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito\'s way "" was destined for underrated heaven . \nthat\'s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . \nand what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \n "" carlito\'s way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . \nof course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he\'s really a crook at heart . \ncarlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can\'t escape into something he is not . \ncarlito\'s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . \nwhen he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . \nhe\'s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he\'s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . \ncarlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that\'s where it\'s at ) , but needs some funding . \nbeing a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . \nand the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . \nhe gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he\'s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . \non the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . \nshe\'s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \nsure , it\'s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \nwhat\'s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \nlike "" apollo 13 , "" we know what\'s going to happen , but we\'re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \nit\'s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \nhis earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i\'m still not over ) . \nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito\'s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino\'s face , it\'s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn\'t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn\'t as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman .

"b""let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . \nso i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was

budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \nin other words , the sound sucked . \nas someone used to digital

the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . \nit is nothing short of stunning visually . \nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i

this lie . \nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \n""",1
"b' "" an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , "" read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ . \ni\'m not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film . \nalessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town . \npolice sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing . \nalso added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn\'s dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . \nwith a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of \'80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point . \nturns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes\'s main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired "" live in the present and for the future "" message . \nmost moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time . \nwide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises . \nsuch a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize . \n ( opens october 16 ) \n'",0

"b'susan granger\'s review of "" the musketeer "" ( universal pictures ) \nhollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas\'s novel that\'s strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . \nthe story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d\'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii\'s elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier . \nthis puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) . \nthe traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don\'t offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) . \nscripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong\'s elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence . \nfilmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv\'ish cuts . \nas the swashbuckling d\'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . \nmena suvari , so impressive in "" american beauty , "" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the musketeer "" is a cinematic but shallow 3 . \n "" all for one and one for all "" ? \nnot this time \'round . \n'",0
"b'it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece . \ncertainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970\'s . \nthe plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad\'s "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . \n "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . \nthe plot is fairly simple . \ncaptain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . \nhis mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice "" . \nalong the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . \nwillard\' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz\' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . \nwillard\'s experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . \nthe movie is visually breathtaking . \nthe battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . \nthe collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . \nthe vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . \nthe journey to kurtz\' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . \nthe most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . \nit is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . \nthe scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . \nthe narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . \ncoppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd . \nthe film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . \nthe problems come when the film slows down . \none of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . \nthe dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . \nthe true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . \nthe film slows down to a drag . \nsheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . \nbrando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . \nthe scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . \nsheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . \nthe entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . \ngranted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . \nbrando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? \nthere are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . \nthere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . \nthe finest scene at the end is sheen\'s escape , and his entrace into the temple . \nhis rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . \nyet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . \nthe psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . \nit is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man\'s mental stamina during bouts of war . \nbut one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . \nthere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . \n'",1
"b'most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \ni think he\'s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen\'s humor comes shining through . \nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen\'s intelligent observations of life . \nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they\'d never seen before . \ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \ndisney\'s a bug\'s life isn\'t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience\'s thirst for computer-animated films . \nbut don\'t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \nin my opinion , dante\'s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it\'s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \nbut now , it\'s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \nwho will prevail ? \ntime will tell , but i\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \nthis may sound like i didn\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\'d put it up there with toy story . \nbut due to it\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\'t appear in disney\'s version . \nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\'s shtick and franz kafka\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \n "" when you\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . "" he comments about his neglected childhood . \none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \nthe second half of the film revolves around z\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \nvisually , it\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \nbut don\'t be fooled . . . \nlittle kids shouldn\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \nvisually , it\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\'t limited by gravity . \nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\'s shoe . \nit\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \ndo they ? ) . \nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \ndisney\'s a bug\'s life looks good , but i don\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\'s done in the past few years . \nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \nin fact , i\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\'s effective nonetheless . \ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\'t recognize her voice either . \nmany people will recognize grant shaud\'s voice as the foreman . \nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\'s grosses . \nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \nmost of it will go over young children\'s heads . \ndoes that mean you shouldn\'t take kids to see it ? \nnot at all . \nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \nthankfully , it\'s not subtle in either aspects . \nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \nhave i confused you enough ? \nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\'ll enjoy it the most . \n'",1

"b'\'bicentennial man\' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . \nchris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs . doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . \nbased on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . \nstarting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . \nsoon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . \nandrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . \nit shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul . \nthis makes him unique and his evil creators worried . \nthen mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn\'t programmed to do . \nsoon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . \nthis film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . \never since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . \nwhat makes us human ? \nthe thoughts ? \nthe emotions ? \nis it possible to become human ? \nat what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? \nthese are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . \nit is obvious that columbus didn\'t take them very seriously . \nwhen you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . \nandrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . \nin other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . \nfurther more , there are other annoying problems . \nto this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . \nthis has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . \ncolumbus is the first to have crossed that line . \nthe result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . \nthe world is simply frozen in time . \nneither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . \nmom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . \nwhen you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you\'ll see a slightly bigger difference . \ni am not saying that everything should change . \nit is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it\'s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . \ni suppose it\'s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it\'s really hard . \nrobin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . \nas always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . \nbut it doesn\'t really matter . \nit is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . \npretty much like last year\'s "" meet joe black "" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn\'t deserve . \ngreat actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . \nwhen isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . \neverything seemed possible . \nnow is the future of asimov\'s time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . \nfor the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne\'s "" 20 000 leagues under the sea "" , so can\'t we accept this story as a potential reality . \nlet us hope that next year\'s "" a . i .

"b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it\'s all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\'s "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that\'s rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn\'t any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\'t trust nature\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n'",0
"b'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n'",1
"b'it\'s not a bad thing to update old stories . \nit\'s done all the time in the oral tradition . \nthe difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it\'s that it\'s dry . \nthe new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come . \nshe\'s a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france . \nwhen her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . \nshe works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night . \nalthough the story is updated , you know the plot . \ndanielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after . \nthe movie is often like watching a filmed play . \ntheater in real life is engrossing . \ntheater on the screen is usually lifeless . \nthere doesn\'t seem to be much going on . \nthe camera can be a star of films . \nhere it\'s a co-conspirator . \ndanielle\'s convictions are compromised . \na socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man . \na kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge . \nthe most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . \nthe fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle . \nhuston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness . \nin all fairness , my companion loved the film . \nmaybe it\'s one of those "" chick flicks "" that men don\'t like . \nit is certainly a date film . \nnearly the entire audience was couples . \noh well , maybe it\'s good for something . \n'",0
"b'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \nit\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \n "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . "" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 "" . \n "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\'t give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn\'t , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it\'s not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction "" . \n "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\'t eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n "" se7en "" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\'s often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\'t going to cure themselves . \n "" se7en "" raises some tough questions and it\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\'s "" se7en "" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in "" 12 monkeys "" , spacey in "" the usual suspects "" ( for which he won ) . \n'",1
"b'the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard\'s materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute . \nindeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . \nincluding this year\'s upcoming a midsummer night\'s dream , shakespeare\'s material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 . \nbut for a change of pace , mrs . \nbrown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love . \nmarc norman and tom stoppard\'s story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . \n ( will shakespeare of the 1590\'s would\'ve been married to anne hathaway , and he would\'ve had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- "" romeo and ethel , the pirate\'s daughter "" -- just doesn\'t quite seem right . \nwith the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , "" romeo and juliet . "" \nthe love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect . \nfiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy . \nthe supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will\'s worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman . \neven ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance . \nthe story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the "" let\'s make a movie "" -genre . \nthe dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience\'s lowest common denominator . \nthere\'s something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material . \nalthough certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998\'s pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . \ncertainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year\'s-open releases is just around the corner . \n'",1

"b""the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \nwhy ? \nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \n""",1
"b'nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- "" frankenweenie , "" "" beetlejuice , "" "" batman , "" "" edward scissorhands , "" "" ed wood , "" "" mars attacks !

"" \ncoppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow , "" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of "" moving pictures , "" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . \n ( there\'s a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . \nwhen the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) \nbottom line : the hollow isn\'t the only thing that\'s sleepy . \n'",0
"b'warren beatty\'s "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn\'t attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . \nsome might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . \nhowever , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . \nbeatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . \nbulworth is a democrat , and in beatty\'s view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . \nonce an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . \ninstead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he\'s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he\'s making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . \nblah , blah , blah . "" \nwhen the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . \nin a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn\'t know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . \nknowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . \nat a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . "" \nlater , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he\'s there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . "" \nall throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth\'s chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . \nplatt has some of the movie\'s funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . \nhis constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth\'s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy\'s refusal to explain bulworth\'s actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . \nwhen bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who\'s trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . \nat this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . \nbulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . \nshe has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . \n ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth\'s campaign . \nsome of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz\'n\'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) . \n "" bulworth\'s "" chief liability is beatty\'s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . \ninstead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . \nit\'s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he\'s actually that incompetent . \nat any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . \nthan snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . \nbeatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . \nother than that , "" bulworth "" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . \nthe film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don\'t agree with beatty\'s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . \nunlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year , "" bulworth "" doesn\'t try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on . \n'",1
"b""in double jeopardy , the stakes are high . \nthink of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . \nthe finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . \n`alex , i'll take homicide for $400 . . .

"b'play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton\'s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \nlike most of shelton\'s other great films ( bull durham , white men can\'t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \nshelton\'s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \nthe whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don\'t even hesitate to pound each other . \nwasn\'t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \nforty five painful minutes remain . \nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \n'",0

"b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\'t be more divergent--- i\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \nshe responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" \nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \nanyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \ni showed her a picture of cusack\'s mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he\'s quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don\'t know him "" . \nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \ni\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) "" . \nhe\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\'s kind of a genius . \nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\'s . \nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\'s and val kilmer\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\'s a hit . \nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \nit\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list "" . \nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\'s day off . \nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\'s witty delivery . \nhe\'s the kind of guy we don\'t mind talking directly to us . \ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\'s all very existential ) . \nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \nhe\'s the kind of guy i\'m sure we\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \nhe\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \nbut fears and black never let that happen . \nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \nhe\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own "" charm "" . \ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\'s hard to see why cusack\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those "" special people "" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \nfears\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \ni\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \n'",1

"" \nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \nbut what we\'re given works well enough . \n "" wild things "" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \n'",1

"b'when i first heard that disney\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm . . . \nthis isn\'t bad at all . \nthis just might have potential . "" \nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \nphil collins\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \nso , the soundtrack wasn\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \nthis film could be good . . . \nbut will it be ? \nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \nthe story starts out with tarzan\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \n "" it\'s not our kind , "" he says . \nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn\'t make him my son . "" \ntarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \ni\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \nyou\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\'s anastasia and dreamworks\' prince of egypt . \ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \nthe casting is fairly good . \ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\'t have a problem with her . \ni take back my insult on driver . \nit\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i\'m gonna kill ya ! "" \nshe says , more than once ) . \ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\'s camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah "" . \ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\'s a good singer . \nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water . \n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \'n sync version of "" trashing the camp "" from the film . \ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \ni was upset that it wasn\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \'n sync to see tarzan . \noh , well . . . \noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \ni wouldn\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\'s greatest achievements . \ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\'s tarzan . \n'",1
"b'susan granger\'s review of "" jeepers creepers "" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) \nthis nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . \nwhen long decides to investigate , there\'s nothing but trouble . \n "" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? \n- well , this is it !

"b'pulp fiction , quentin tarantino\'s anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . \nin all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . \nas if reservoir dogs wasn\'t perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . \nevery major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . \nto begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . \nthese two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . \ntravolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . \nif these two characters were not enough , there\'s the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the "" problem solver "" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . \nthese are just the major characters . \nsmaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men "" behind "" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . \nthe film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . \nthe film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . \nthe two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . \nafter this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . \nutilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . \nthe two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . \nafter basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . \nthis is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \n "" hand cannon "" , shooting at the two gangsters . \nhe somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . \nthis is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . \nthe film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . \nbutch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . \nvincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus\' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . \nvincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . \nafter their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent\'s high-priced heroin , dubbed a "" monster "" by lance . \neach story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . \neventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . \npulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . \nalong with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . \nand with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . \nsurely , quentin tarantino\'s fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . \n'",1
"b'the first in a very long list of things wrong with "" i still know what you did last summer "" is the title . \nthink about it for a second . \nif the last movie was called "" i know what you did last summer "" , wouldn\'t the next movie have to be "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" ? \nif anyone working on this movie had an i . q . \ngreater than five would have thought about it logically and said , "" hey . . . \nwait a minute "" . \nbut alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won\'t hold them to that . \nwhat i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick . \ni guess i\'m one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the "" kind of "" ) . \nit wasn\'t great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn\'t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it\'s sequel did . \nthere are just so many problems with this movie that it\'s hard trying to figure out where to start . \nfirst of all , i guess , is the setting . \nthe movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting . \nexactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? \nthe movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through . \nin one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can\'t get out , no matter how hard she tries . \nwhen julie discovers she\'s going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue . \nnow , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin\' thing off ? \nin another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , "" just don\'t tell anybody it rained the whole time .

"b""while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . \nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . \nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \n_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \nlike a zombie . \n""",0

"b'the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year\'s finest films . \nso , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . \nit is a rare thing for a children\'s movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn\'t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly "" magical "" piece of work ? \na tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . \nlooking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . \nbelieve me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . \nthe plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . \nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . \nthe only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . \nproblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded "" city "" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . \nsetting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . \nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . \nhere is where the film took a wrong turn . \nup until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . \nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . \nunfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . \nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . \nat one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . \nat other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget\'s full cavity search at the airport . \nin fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . \nhowever , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . \nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . \nanother problem i found with the film was it\'s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . \nif you\'re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . \nit may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . \nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? \nit just didn\'t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . \n'",0
"b'battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . \nin fact , i\'ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . \nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \nit\'s the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \nwhen were we conquered ? \nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we\'re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \nkeep reading ) . \nalso , why don\'t we get to see earth get conquered ? \nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film\'s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \nthe "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \nand , we\'re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can\'t even handle a few cavemen ? \none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \nshouldn\'t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \nthe psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs "" . \nwhy aren\'t they "" dog animals "" ? \nthe psychlos are after mining earth\'s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \nwhy do i even care at this point ? \ni\'m a fan of travolta\'s and i\'m glad to see he\'s back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \nhe\'s more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn\'t hold back my laughter . \nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \nalso , travolta\'s acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \nooooo , scary villain . \nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \nfolks , save your cash . . \ndon\'t go see it , don\'t rent it , and don\'t buy it . \nyou\'d be more entertained by taking the money you\'d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \nwe\'ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \nunless of course you\'re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you\'ll come away with from this movie . \nthat , and a headache . \n[editor\'s note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \ni\'m not sure why . . . \nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \n'",0
"b""a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . \nhoward pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) . \nafter a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon . \njeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . \nhe incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . \nhe stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . \nthings change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . \nhe nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . \nby accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . \nwhen other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . \nrealizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . \nbut elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . \nas a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . \nwhile with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . \nhis boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . \nbut soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . \nthere they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . \nthe police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . \nin jail , things look bad for him . \nno one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . \nhis boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . \nout on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . \nthrough a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . \nonce there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . \nthe film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . \nhe is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . \nit was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . \na very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . \nthe film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . \nit instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw . \n""",0
"b'in zoolander , the world\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? "" \nobviously , the film\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\'s model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\'s hoping to use mugatu\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben\'s dad who\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it\'s just because i can\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\'t had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n'",1
"b""wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . \nyou can see its plot developing from a mile away . you \nare lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . \nthis is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . \nthat this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . \nthe fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the \nmain quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . \nthis is done without her knowledge . \nit is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . \nit is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . \nit is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . \nof course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . \nthe contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . \nalan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . \nthis sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . \nthat we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . \nanyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . \nthe dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . \nand , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place . \n""",0

"b'these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . \nbut , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . \nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . \nthe way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . \none of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . \nin order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . \nseven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . \nthis time , however , third time wasn\'t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . \neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . \neddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . \nthe routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley\'s boss . \ndetermined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . \nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . \nthere , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . \nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . \nin this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn\'t work . \nscreenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . \nsince foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . \nunfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . \nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . \nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can\'t balance the comedy with "" regular "" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . \naction scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . \nto make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . \nin the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren\'t any plans for beverly hills iv . \n'",0

"b'ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python\'s spanish inquisition \nsynopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? \nbelieve it . \nsliding doors is a love \'what if\' story . \nthe gimmick is that it\'s really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . \nin the beginning , likeable gal \'helen\' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . \nso she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . \nhelen doesn\'t know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . \nthe film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . \nin story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . \narriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nthis leads to a life where helen moves out . \nhelen\'s winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . \nin story two , helen experiences a different fate . \nshe misses the train , never meets james , and doesn\'t get home early enough to discover gerry\'s infidelity . \nin this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . \nwill the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? \nopinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . \nat last here\'s proof that there\'s still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . \nsliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . \nnot only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it\'s also easily gwyneth paltrow\'s best recent performance . \nwhen helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a \'shagging wanker , \' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she\'s talking about ! \nnor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . \nnobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling !

"b'contact ( pg ) there\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \ncontact is clearly foster\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\'s weakest subplot ) . \njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\'s yet more wondrously pure . \nand zemeckis doesn\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\'t entertaining . \nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\'s being sold as-- "" a journey to the heart of the universe . "" \nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \n'",1

"b""summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \nthere's also problems with the plot . \njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \n""",0

"b'any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . \nunfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . \nthe first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . \nthe tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . \nteamwork was the key . \nthis film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma\'s "" blow out , "" where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . \nit was travolta\'s vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . \nin this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there\'s no fun going on here whatsoever . \nthe story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes . \nthere are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved . \nthe actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie . \ntom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby "" the brain "" heenan than jim phelps . \nbrian depalma\'s career has been bafflingly erratic . \nat his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( "" blow out , "" "" carrie , "" "" body double "" ) but this is not his best . \nthe screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in "" chinatown , "" but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst . \nthe cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old "" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape "" trick . \nplease don\'t spend your money on this ; it\'ll only encourage hollywood to make more . \n'",0
"b'at one point during brian de palma\'s crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : "" can\'t you stop saying \'fuck\' all the time ?

of the pack . \nhe\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \nhe\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\'t need them . \nhe so believes in his convictions that he\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \n "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \nor at least , that\'s the intention . \nthe film\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him . \nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \nhe\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\'s wisened up . \nhe\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \nbut danny won\'t . \nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \n "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\'ve seen all year . \none scene features a dinner between derek\'s family , and his mother\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\'s reaction to derek\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \nthere\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \nthere\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \nsadly enough , this isn\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \nit\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\'t as well travelled . \nfurlong\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \neven derek\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\'t seem justified . \nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \nsorta . \n "" american history x "" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to "" alan smithee , "" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \nkaye\'s right in that it\'s not up to par , even if he\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \nthis will not be a "" do the right thing "" for the late 90s . \nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \nand even if it isn\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \n'",1
"b'seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic\'s pass . \n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \nwar is a topic that can\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \nit\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \n "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \nit proves there\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \nit\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \n "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \nwe don\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\'re there . \nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\'t happen . \nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \nthe film seems to rely on the audience\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . "" \nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \nhe\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \nhe doesn\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\'s death simultaneously . \nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \nit\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . "" \nthe saving of private ryan isn\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \nwhen miller\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\'t so quick to shrug it off . \nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\'s sense of hope a reality . \nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\'s group a destination , but not direction . \nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\'s major philosophical metaphors . \nthe soldiers don\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\'t want us to think these men are invincible . \nin fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . \nalthough the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . \nwhether they\'re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . \nsure , there\'s a zinger here and there , but war doesn\'t change the fact boys will be boys . \nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . \nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . \nprivate ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? \nthat\'s not a premise for thrills , it\'s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . \nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . \ni remember reading a "" calvin & hobbes "" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , "" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? "" \n "" saving private ryan "" is the adult version of that question . \n'",1
"b""i love movies . \ni really do . \nevery time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . \neven lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . \nthen there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . \ndisney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . \nchristopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . \nalong with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' \n'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . \nmany bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . \nfilled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . \nchristopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . \njeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . \nhis performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . \ndarryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . \nhurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' \nway to go liz ! \nfor the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' \nbefore finally giving up and switching off . \nanother major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' \nunfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . ' \ninstead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . \nalthough meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud . \na real dud . \ncitizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . \neven the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . \nit's a nice special effect , though . \nanother problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . \nor rather , the lack of them . \nmy favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . \nnow , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . \nbut here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . ' \nit's insulting . \nthere's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . \neither that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . \nyes , men at work . \nyowza ! \nthe fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . \nthere are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . \nthankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet . \n""",0
"b""expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . \nroger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . \ni read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . \nthe opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . \nthe landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . \none can almost sense the cold . \nbut the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . \nthis is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . \nthe movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . \nthis chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . \nin the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . \nin a gym bag . ? \naffliction too was set in a snowy landscape . \nit really seems very simple . \njust hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . \nbut the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . \nas in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . \nbut doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . \nthe movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . \ni have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . \nthe biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . \nthe writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . \nthis is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . \nthe movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . \ni'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . \neven a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . \nthe man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . \nturns out . . . \nwell , see the movie . \none should be warned against seeing the trailer . \nit reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . \nbut much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . \n""",1
"b'confucius once said , "" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don\'t overdo it . "" \nhis maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . \ngranted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn\'t exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series "" beavis and butt-head "" was pure gold for its network ) . \nbut unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . \nthe iffiness in judge\'s plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . \nin fact , based on the popularity of scott adams\' cartoon "" dilbert , "" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . \nunfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of "" saturday night live "" rather than a full-length feature . \nthe most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie\'s top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . \nother evidence of office space\'s failure to work are its lack of good jokes . \nthe comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . \nthe material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . \nhowever , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . \nthe plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . \nafter the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of "" downsizing "" the company\'s payroll . \nwhen peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) \'s stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . \nthe circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . \na sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it\'s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent . \n'",0

"b'yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn\'t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . \nneve campbell and starship trooper\'s denise richards getting it on ? \nok ! \nyeah , it\'s a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that\'s your main interest in this film , there\'s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . \nwild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . \nnearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . \nbut this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn\'t leave much time to enjoy the surprises . \nwe start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . \nguidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . \nright off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce "" mr . lombardo "" . \nthe fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor\'s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you\'ll be soaked from head to toe when you\'re done . \non the weekend of the car wash , kelly\'s attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . \nnaturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . \nbut the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . \npitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . \nyes , that bill murray ! \nsound like a good , complete movie ? \nyes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . \nin fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . \nit is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . \nby the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . \nunfortunately , with so much going on , you\'re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . \nthis is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could\'ve been . \nthe 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could\'ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . \nthe acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . \nand it\'s not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap "" party of five "" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . \ndillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year\'s in & out , gives the best performance , and murray\'s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . \nin fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . \nthat\'s how cheezy it comes off . \nbut aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full\'s . \nin the right hands , wild things could\'ve been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . \nand what\'s up with these people passing as high school students ? \ni realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn\'t supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . \ni won\'t lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . \nas corny as it is , it\'s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a "" b "" for effort . \nbut if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year\'s starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . \nof course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you\'ll be right at home with wild things . \nperhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . \n'",0
"b'after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball . \nfiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . \nthere are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . \nthe stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . \nthe astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . \ninterior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . \ninstead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart . \nmission to mars takes it\'s first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done . \nduring these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife . \nit\'s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety . \nthe rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability . \nthere is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time . \nmaybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects . \nit\'s the year 2020 and this is nasa\'s first manned excursion to the red planet . \na crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results . \ngraham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth . \nin response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o\'connell ) . \nobstacles are put in the crew\'s way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them . \ni should say , mcconnell goes about solving them . \ntime and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn\'t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn\'t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable . \n ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew\'s mission and life is in mortal danger . \non a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link . \nwomen serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character\'s personality trait . ) \nby the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush . \nthere is an adage in film to "" show , don\'t tell . "" \nmission to mars does both . \nrepeatedly . \ncharacters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them . \nthe film\'s conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying . \nas i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film . \nthe best i could come up with is pre-teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film\'s components would have been old hat even for them . \ni have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b-movie . \nthe key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material . \ni felt no such earnestness . \n'",0

"b'every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . \ni don\'t necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i\'m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . \nusually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . \nit has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . \nthat\'s a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . \nwhat\'s more , it\'s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . \nprincess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . \napparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . \nher banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . \nthis development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . \nhowever , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . \nas a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . \nit takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . \nbut it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . \nhe is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . \nwhile hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . \nhe also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a "" sensation "" at court . \nin one of the film\'s best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . \nit is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . \nsocial commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . \nthe performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . \nher supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls\' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . \nonly john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess\'s identity . \nthe story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . \nit is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn\'t given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . \nwhen it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . \nprincess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . \nstill , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . \nit is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . \n'",1
"b'if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . \nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . \ni suppose i should have seen this coming . \nafter all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn\'t anything i\'d lose sleep over . \nclearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . \nis it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? \nno , not really . \npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \nthe priest\'s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie\' s story , considering she\'s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated . \nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \n . \n . \ni mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it\'s only interesting for about five minutes . \ni\'m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? \nlook at what i can do ! \ni\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . "" \nmaybe then he\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\'t see it . \njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \narrrrrrrghhhh . \n . \n . \nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\'t bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \nthough wainwright\'s vanity certainly doesn\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\'s kind of cute , so let\'s start the bleeding ! \nthe fact that she\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\'t help , either . \naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \ngo clubbing ! \nsure , that makes sense . \narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \neven though frankie page\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \nfather andrew\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i\'ll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \ntrust me , i\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \nwhat\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \nfirst of all , the film doesn\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \nactually , i\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \nwhich one is it ? \nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \nthere\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \n "" stigmata\'s "" religion is so off-base that it can\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \ni\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \nit\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does . \nit\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \ni\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \nmaybe it\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \nso much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\'s ( many ) flaws . \ni\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and "" stigmata "" is it . \n'",0

"b""anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . \nit's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . \nanna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . \nwith son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . \nmongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . \nanna function is to help provide that link . \nthe core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . \nfoster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . \nshe is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . \nit is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . \nshe brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . \nit's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . \nwhen she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . \nchow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . \nthis is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . \nhe is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . \nit is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . \nprecious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . \nit strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . \nsome may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . \nalthough a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . \nanna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . \nit shows a seduction of intelligence . \never mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . \n""",1

( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead . \ndad\'s subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father . \ndad was fighting a fire when they shot him . \nnow derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart . \nderek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence . \nat a basketball court , black and white tempers flare . \nderek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts . \nwhen the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch . \ncameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek\'s life as a surrogate father . \nhe takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings . \nkeeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation . \nderek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes . \nat the bottom of the chain , derek\'s younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong . \none night three black youths break into derek\'s truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for . \noutside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all . \nthe third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded . \nin the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp . \n ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) \nthe police arrive just as derek kills the last thief . \nderek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down . \nderek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin . \nnow in prison , derek faces new challenges . \nas the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me . "" \nthere is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy . \nthey only use the symbols as a means of intimidation . \nderek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid . \nwhen derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed . \nwithout derek\'s leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture . \nit is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he\'s screwed up . \nin the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny . \nthe film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience . \nedward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance . \nalthough some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton\'s performance compensated . \n ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . ) \nhe also captured the essence of an older brother . \nhe took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart . \nthough clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring . \nthe subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at . \nnevertheless its subjects are part of humanity\'s great face . \nkaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture . \n'",1

"" \nlook at her closely ; she really can\'t act at all . \nher reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . \nshe reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . \nshe moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . \nshe frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . \nmaxwell caulfield plays joe\'s actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a "" natural "" blonde . \nbob\'s personality ( not to mention caulfield\'s acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera "" passion crest "" --stiff and uninteresting . \nmaybe that\'s the point . \ndaryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . \nhannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she\'s only 37 ) . \nwhy is that ? \nalmost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . \nwhy is that ! ? \nmarlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . \nkathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . \nbuck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . \nchristopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . \nand so on . \nthe best parts of the "" the real blonde "" are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . \nthere\'s more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . \nwhile this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters\' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it\'s funny . \n'",0
"b'as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn\'t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . \nthis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . \nthey fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . \nthat\'s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . \ncertainly hodges is not complaining . \nyears pass . \nhodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . \nchilders , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . \nbecause of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . \nchilders does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . \nafter three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . \nmore than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . \nchilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . \nhe persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . \ndid childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? \nor are there simply no rules in war ? \nthe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . \nthe murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? \nwhere is the u . n . ? \nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \none of the earliest apparent problems with \'rules of engagement\' is its lack of credibility . \nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \nthat is precisely why it\'s not offensive . \nit is completely unobjective . \nmany stories are started and never finished . \nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \nis it about arab mentality ? \namerica\'s foreign policies ? \namerica\'s role in the world ? \ncorruption in the higher circles ? \nit goes on and on . \nit consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . \nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . \ni think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin\'s probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . \nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . \nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . \ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . \nit\'s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . \nthe characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . \neven the actors can not save this film from going under . \nthough both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . \nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . \njackson is gray and jones uninteresting . \nthe rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . \nthe time has come for the verdict . \non the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . \non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . \nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it\'s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . \ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . \nthis is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . \nhowever , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . \nand that it\'s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . \n'",0
"b'contact is the 1997 movie i\'ve seen the most - five times to be exact . \nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it\'s a very impressive film . \nthe same can\'t be said for films like independance day , but that\'s because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn\'t offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \ncontact\'s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space . \nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \nellie\'s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world\'s overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth "" . \ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \nit\'s a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn\'t get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \nas if that weren\'t enough , ellie\'s discovery leads her to the nation\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \nthe question is , can a person who doesn\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \neven when the film wraps up , it\'s uncertain whether it\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \ndon\'t get me wrong . \nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \nit\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci-fi "" . \nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\'ve ever seen . \nthis is zemeckis\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \n'",1
"b'i must admit i\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \nthe story of serendipity is simple . \ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \nsara declares that if this "" thing "" -- let\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that "" thing "" was right after all . \nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \non the flipside , films such as you\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\'s main journey at hand . \nbut it\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \n'",1

"b'bats is this year\'s camp flick . \nwith the world\'s worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity . \nas for the rest of us , well . . . \ni\'d say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway . \nfollow their lead and you\'ll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . \ni love alfred hitchcock\'s the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . \nit saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats . \nwhen mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate . \nit turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious . \nwhy has he done this , you ask ? \nbecause , you see , it is apparently a scientist\'s job to make things "" a little better , "" even if that means the death of all mankind . \nso the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world . \nof course , that can\'t happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture . \nconsider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave . \nthe bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out . \nwhat do they do ? \ndo they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? \nnope . \nthey stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes . \nwhat keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes . \nwe don\'t even get to see what\'s going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick . \nall we know is that bats are attacking . \nhow they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery . \na little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some . \nof course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn\'t really go anywhere . \nmost of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist\'s wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like "" i hate bats ! "" \nsome of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept . \ni hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners . \nplaying such characters does not help actors\' careers . \nstill , i suppose that if you\'re looking for a movie that is "" so bad it\'s good , "" you could do worse than bats . \nit does have a tremendous amount of camp value . \ni\'m not "" recommending "" the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it . \nmore power to them . \n'",0
"b""in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . \nthe hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . \nthe cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . \nall chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . \nthe duo must always be completely mismatched . \nthe hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . \nhowever , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . \nrush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . \nproving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . \nstill , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . \nthis film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . \njackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . \nor , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . \ndespite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . \njackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . \nchris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . \nhowever , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . \nperfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . \nwhen he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . \nstill being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . \nchris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . \nsince he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . \nwhile dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . \nwhile not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . \nlee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) \nwhen contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \n""",1

"b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\'s steven spielberg drama "" schindler\'s list "" and directed 1993\'s intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \nwhat doesn\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\'s drinking water . \nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \nwatching the film , i couldn\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\'s far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \nnot only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \nin "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \nyou\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what "" a civil action "" does . \nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \naside from one flashback to when a man\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \ni could say the performances were good , but who\'s fooling who ? \nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\'s about all he does . \nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\'s final scene , as a judge ? \nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , "" a civil action "" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \n'",0
"b'set in the late 80\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create . \nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\'s less cryptic than ellis\' novel . \nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \nit\'s a subtle in-joke and it\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \ni\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \non a similar note , whitney houston\'s cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \napparently , houston wasn\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \ndon\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\'m still undecided . \nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\'s reality ) . \ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \nit may not change anyone\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \ni know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it . \n[r] \n'",1
"b""one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting . \nthe main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone . \nthey attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey . \ncarver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there . \nwhen nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life . \nscrewer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients . \ndr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing . \nhowever , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug . \nthe performances are all very commendable . \nsid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role . \nkenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital . \njoan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey . \ncharles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . \nsome critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . \nas a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part . \nother regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks . \nboth jacques and windsor play their parts well . \npatsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth . \nthe jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing . \nalthough it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . \na must-see carry on movie . \n""",1
"b'in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \ntaken as a whole , there\'s little that\'s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \nbut it\'s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it\'s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \nal pacino\'s slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \nand matt damon\'s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o\'donnell\'s charlie . \nwill is a troubled individual . \nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \nbut he\'s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building\'s hall blackboards . \nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a "" taster\'s choice moment . "" \nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it\'s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \nthere\'s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie\'s friendship . \nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it\'s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \narguably the best dramatic work in the actor\'s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren\'t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the "" good "" in the title . \n'",1
"b""last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \nthe answer is just about everything . \nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \nhe's too much of a joker . \ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \n""",0
"b""filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . \ndoug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . \nin his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . \nbut he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . \nhis movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . \nconsistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . \nthe thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . \nin story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . \nneither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . \n ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) \nthe early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . \nthe characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . \nin fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . \nalthough that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . \ngo doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . \nas far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . \n ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) \nat times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night . \n""",0
"b' "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . "" \nstarring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . \nrated r . \ndouble jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that\'s also one of the year\'s most enjoyable . \nit\'s an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . \nthere is not a moment here when the events on screen don\'t have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . \nit has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that\'s probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . \nnot even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . \nwe meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin\' sex , they go to sleep . \nlibby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . \nshe follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . \nat that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . \nher lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . \nher friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . \nonce in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . \nher friend gives her son the phone . \nnick walks in the room . \nlittle matty screams "" daddy ! "" \nthe phone goes dead . \nlibby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn\'t even dead . \nshe gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can\'t convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can\'t touch her . \nafter a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . \nshe is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . \nshe sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . \nshe winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son\'s "" adopter "" . \ndouble jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . \nthe law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . \nit\'s not like it matters . \nthis is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . \nit\'s silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don\'t question . \nin some films , plausibility is everything . \ndouble jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . \njudd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . \nthis is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . \nshe brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . \ntommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . \nthankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film\'s story . \nthis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . \nthe sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . \nafter all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it\'s great to see a movie that doesn\'t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . \ndouble jeopardy is really good , but it isn\'t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . \nit\'s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . \nthis is a thriller that isn\'t concerned with being smart or plausible . \ninstead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . \n'",1
"b'the film "" magnolia "" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \n "" magnolia "" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of "" boogie nights "" fame . \nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make "" magnolia "" memorable . \nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \nanderson\'s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia\'s "" scenes drag on too long . \nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn\'t get boring . \nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall\'s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \nanderson\'s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \nthe performances in "" magnolia "" are perfection . \nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \nanderson allows many of hollywood\'s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon\'s character as phillip baker hall\'s wife . \nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \n "" magnolia "" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \n'",1
"b""martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \npersonally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \n""",1
"b'i\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\'s political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\'t do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\'t quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\'s "" dr . \nstrangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\'t do that . \nthat said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy . "" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , "" wag the dog "" doesn\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it\'s fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\'t even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n'",1
"b""as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . \nparents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . \nbut if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . \n`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . \nthe man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . \nhere is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . \nhe is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . \nbut as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . \nwe see that he is a mean-tempered person . \nhe has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . \nhe is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . \nhe also has tremendous problems with relationships . \nhe is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . \nbut his bearish persona and stature alienates her . \nhe is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . \nhis demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . \nshe tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . \nfinally , he is spiteful and vindictive . \nas a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . \nas the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . \nwe can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . \nhe is a prisoner and a slave to it . \nhe is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . \nwhat kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? \nwe learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . \nthis is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . \nhe is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . \nwe see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . \nto heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . \nvery effective . \ntoday , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . \nthe influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . \nthe result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . \nthis is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . \nhe's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . \ncoburn displays heft as the bitter dad . \nbut , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . \nthere's nothing light or fluffy about this film . \nthat may turn many moviegoers away . \nbut it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents . \n""",1
"b'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what\'s left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . \nas a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . \nan actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . \ngenerally , though , the actor doesn\'t matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . \nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . \nrussell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . \nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we\'re into todd\'s later years . \nhe\'s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . \nthe pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he\'s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie\'s start . \nbetween the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it\'s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . \ndirector paul anderson , who helmed last year\'s icy thriller , event horizon , doesn\'t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . \ntodd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a "" routine patrol "" and set the stage for the final firefight . \nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . \nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . \nit\'s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . \nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . \na strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . \n'",0
"b'a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today\'s youth seem attracted to black culture . \nthe review \nif black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . \nhowever , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . \nblack & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america\'s youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . \nfeaturing a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback\'s is a complex film worth seeing . \nblack & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . \nthere is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . \nthis eventually spills over into the life of dean\'s long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . \nrich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . \nmeanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . \nothers who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean\'s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . \nmike tyson . \nthe stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . \nfriendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . \noriginally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . \nwhile the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . \nthe three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . \nthe frequent sex is one of the film\'s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . \nto toback\'s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . \nthese gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . \nwhenever a character finds himself on donager\'s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . \ncharlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i\'ll be way over this . "" \nthese youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . \ntoback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . \nmost of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film\'s comic relief without really trying . \nhe is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson\'s image as a dimwit . \nbut tyson also gets the film\'s scariest moment . \nas he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . \nthe scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . \nthe reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr\'s face turns a frightening shade of purple . \nblack & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film\'s omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . \nbut toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character\'s struggle . \nthus black & white\'s message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . \ntoback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . \nand we do . \n'",1

"b""in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \nhow is the titanic a character ? \nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \n""",1
"b'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat\'s true of home alone 2 and i\'d bet money that it\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\'t get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\' cruelty . \nkevin\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\'s going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe\'s finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\'s secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\'t much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it\'s not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\'t act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\'s insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\'s life about five times . \ninstead of "" i\'m gonna get that kid "" they say "" i\'m gonna kill that kid . "" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n'",1
"b'for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \nand not a particularly good one at that . \nwhat went wrong ? \nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \nwhy ? \ni haven\'t the foggiest . \ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \nit\'s possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \nthe scenes i\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \ngod forbid . \nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \nsure it\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \ncruise grins a little too slyly . \nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \nhe\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\'s ) . \nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\'s initial "" i\'m the man ! "" \ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\'t stop . \nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \nwe\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \nit isn\'t done any differently here . \nthe action is pure hard target \\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \nhe\'s cool for sure but he\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \nthe actor isn\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \nwhen he\'s not beaming away , he\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \nhe fetishizes cruise\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\'s really austin powers . \nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "" so you thought i was dead . . . "" . \nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \nwhat a hero ! \nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2\'s plot . \nmy reasoning is simple : i\'m not sure of any good it would do . \nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next "" special "" effect . \ni wasn\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\'ll surely regret it . \nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\'s ( that film\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \nit\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \n'",0
"b'about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! "" \nat that point it hit me : i didn\'t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn\'t really like . \nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he\'s being played by sidney poitier , you know something\'s rotten in the state of denmark . \nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \nthis was the third one of \'97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \n "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements . \nand you thought "" the saint "" was bad . \n "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i\'ve yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \nis he ? \nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he\'ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \'97 ) who\'s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \nsoon , he\'s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \nit doesn\'t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \nthe script of "" the jackal "" is a complete mess , mostly because it can\'t decide what it wants to focus on . \nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\'s in everything for the money ? \nor is it a combination of both ? \n "" the jackal "" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \nthe supporting characters are worse . \nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \nwhat is poitier doing here ? \nhe\'s one of the best living actors ! \ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \ndiane venora\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \nit\'s not that anyone\'s bad here ; it\'s that they have nothing to do . \nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \nthere are several times where he\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \ntake a scene where he\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \ndoesn\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \ngeez ! \nis there anything good here ? \nwell . . . a \ncouple things . \ni did like willis\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is "" the jackal . "" \ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior "" rob roy "" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( "" clear and present danger , "" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but "" the jackal "" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \n'",0
"b'call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\'s consistently interesting , it\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . "" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he\'s taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\'re up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\'s geno\'s steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit\'s not that he\'s bad per se , but he\'s not very interesting . \nthere\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\'s or sutherland\'s work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n'",1

"" \nthis uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . \nalong the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . \nthe film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . \nliz is everyone\'s favorite because she\'s both beautiful and kind . \nliz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . \nin order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . \nthey then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney\'s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz\'s dead body ) . \ncourtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . \nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \nhowever , an investigation begins into liz\'s death and the film becomes excessively dull . \nthe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \ncourtney\'s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \nfern\'s rise to popularity is equally lame . \nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \nit\'s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school\'s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \nit at least provides us with a look at courtney\'s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn\'t make any sense . \nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz\'s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie\'s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema\'s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . \nthe only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . \nthe costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . \nthey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . \ndirector of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve\'s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . \nshot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . \nperformances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . \nnone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . \nthe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 .

"b'and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year . \nturns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts . \nit\'s a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . \nfor a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it\'s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . \nfor the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn\'t count ) is no fun at all . \n "" end of days "" is a major stinker . \nthe movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . \nsome catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . \nif he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . \nthe pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . \nin new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . \ntwenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem . \nnow working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . \nan assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . \nrecognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . \nthere are so many problems with this film it\'s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? \ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\'s location by offering him his old life back . \nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\'t up to the task . \nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \nthis one isn\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \nas the prince of darkness , he\'s suave and confident . \nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \nbyrne\'s speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" \'tis not ! "" \nvariety ) are feeble at best . \nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \nkevin pollack plays jericho\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \nrobin tunney isn\'t given much to do except look scared . \nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \nthis being an action blockbuster , it\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\'s utterly ridiculous . \nwhy is the devil coming on new year\'s eve , 1999 ? \nbecause it\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\'t 666 , it turns out . \nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\'ve got 1999 ! \nif you don\'t buy this explanation , you\'re not alone . \nit\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \n . \n . ) , and if that weren\'t bad enough , there\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\'t explained at all . \nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\'s powerless ? \nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \nhow come he can\'t control jericho or christine ? \nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\'s never actually explained . \nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \nit gets so formulaic that it\'s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come . \ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don\'t care about these characters ( due to the script\'s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don\'t make any sense . \nthere\'s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \nit\'s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \nsupposedly we\'re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it\'s often hard to tell why it\'s happening in the first place , not to mention that they\'re edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! "" \n "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it\'s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \nthe devil apparently doesn\'t operate in the more subtle , i\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \nthis doesn\'t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it\'s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \nscenes aren\'t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \nreasons ? \nto hell with reasons ! \nlet\'s just blow stuff up ! \nisn\'t it cool ? \nnope , not by a long shot . \nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \nit\'s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it\'s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \n "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn\'t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody\'s going to buy . \nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \nif it\'s going to be campy , arnold shouldn\'t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn\'t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn\'t be such a sad sack . \nas it stands , "" end of days "" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . \n'",0
"b'the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it\'s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . \nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo\'s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . \nhowever , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . \nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . \nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas\'s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . \nwe\'re the fans , not the freaks . \nwe won\'t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won\'t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we\'re throwing down . \nall right , stop looking at me like that . \nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting . \nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . \nyou see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . \nunfortunately , it is not our savior . \nfor weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . \nanything less and it\'ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . \ni didn\'t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn\'t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . \ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent . \nwith the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film\'s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . \nnone seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . \ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . \njar jar\'s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . \nhis speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn\'t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . \nhis head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . \ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . \nin star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy . "" \nin the phantom menace , we get doo doo . \nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . "" \nthis film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it\'s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . \nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it\'s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . \ni liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? \nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \ndidn\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \ndidn\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \nof course they did , and it\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \nthe people at lucas\'s industrial light and magic , the world\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\'s robot army and jar jar\'s countrymen . \nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\'s release . \nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\'s cells . \nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \ndon\'t let me mislead you too far . \nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \nit\'s just that when held up to it\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \n'",1

"b""not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns . \nreal westerns . \nthese were some of the best films of the twentieth century . \nthose days are gone . \nnow we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western . \nand that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws . \noutlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) . \ndelayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james . \nalas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch . \nthe spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . \nbut trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . \nthe jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people . \nalong the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live . \nthey rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background . \nthe witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card . \nthe biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell . \nafter a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . \nand his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal . \ncombined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . \nthe unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . \nnot to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . \ninstead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago . \n""",0

"b'andrew lloyd webber\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . "" \nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \nlike "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\'t spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \n "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\'t like di slept to "" the top "" ) . \nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \nit\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\'s musicals never undermine this . \nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \nthis is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down . \nokay , it is a let-down . \ni\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\'re pretty good . \nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \nin the musical , it\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless . \nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\'t pull it off . \nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \n>from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\'s people downtrodden . \nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \nthat\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\'s done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don\'t cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \nmadonna\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \nat the beginning , she looks like she\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \nher death , though , is brilliant . \nher singing could be better though . \ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\'s trying to hard . \nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \nlupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \nbut it\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" \'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \nlike the other musical released in \'96 ( woody allen\'s "" everyone says i love you "" ) , it\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \n'",1
"b' * * * the following review contains spoilers * * * \n "" it\'s just . . . \nthe way . . . \nwe are . "" \n--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl\'s ( helen slater ) query as to why she\'s being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl . \ni\'ll admit it . . . \ni love superman iii . \ni know it\'s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it\'s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . \nsupergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series\' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn\'t even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii . \nsupergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time . \nas the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives . \nok . . . \nwhat ? \nso these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? \nwere they living there before krypton exploded ? \nhow do you get to "" inner space "" ? \nthis whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . \nhow do they know where superman went ? \nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? \nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . \nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . \none day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o\' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman\'s cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . \nkara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city . \nin the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . \nin three days time , or something . \nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . \nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . \nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . \nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she\'s arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . \nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . \nok . . . \nhuh ? \nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? \nattention movie : explain yourself ! \ni\'m sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . \ni can\'t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . \nknowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . \nshe\'s given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? \nlois lane\'s sister , lucy . \nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we\'re getting really contrived now . \nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \nat this point i\'m rapidly wondering why i\'m bothering with this nonsense . \nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done . \nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara\'s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film\'s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) . \nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \nit\'s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \ninstead of having her look like she\'s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise . \nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \nfinally , just one word : monsters . \nfaye dunaway and peter o\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\'toole overacts he\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" \nat one point ) . \ndunaway\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\'s written to be , as she\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \nbelievability aside though , it\'s still annoying . \nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \nyet i\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \nyou\'d think you were watching a new release . \nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\' golan-globus production ) . \nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\'s no dead air on the track . \nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\'t get that response . \nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \ngreat detail is given about superman\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \nfor the sake of brevity , i won\'t even get into that one . \nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy "" whimsical fantasy "" nonsense . \nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\'t even get into that one . \nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \ndisc two features the never before seen director\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\'toole\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\'t care . \none question though . . . \nshouldn\'t the director\'s commentary be on the director\'s cut of the film ? \ni\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \ni knew the film wasn\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \nugh , i give up . \ni\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \n[pg] \n'",0
"b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\'s failure . \nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \nso special effects or not , if the story isn\'t the least bit scary , you aren\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \nlike the original , taylor\'s character is the star of the movie . \nbut since she doesn\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \nand let\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \ni\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\'t in it . \nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \nthere really isn\'t much of a story here . \njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \nand the special effects are great . \nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota . \nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \nbut not scary . \nthen we have the set . \nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ?

"b""apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n""",1
"b""die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . \nplace the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . \nevery line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . \nthe plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . \nthe film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . \nso much for the script . \nhow about the action ? \nwell , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . \nby contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . \ndie harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . \nin fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . \nyou do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . \ndie hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . \n""",0
"b""well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . \nnot to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . \nonce again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . \nthe rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . \nit seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . \nthe plot in brief . \npaul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . \nhis race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . \nhe visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . \nhe also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . \nbut before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . \ni must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . \nbritish actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . \nbut his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . \nthe weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . \nyork is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . \nthis is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him . \nand while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . \nthe casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . \nthe balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . \nthe film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . \nand it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . \nin fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . \ntighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . \nbut these are minor complaints . \njust see it . \nnot of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . \nand michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . \n""",1
"b'a miracle of filmmaking , "" some like it hot "" is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists . \nit is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder\'s career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make . \njerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves . \none night , as they\'re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided . \nas it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) . \nseveral weeks later , on valentine\'s day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage . \neager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid . \nthe only catch . . its a girls band . \nso josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida . \non the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love . \njerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there\'s two problems : 1 ) they\'re in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne . \nwhat follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the "" italian opera lovers festival "" . \ntony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar . \nmarilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity . \nthe scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon . \nlemmon is hysterical as daphne . \ncast as the less rational one , lemmon\'s performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder\'s . \nbrown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony . \nhe manages to use lemmon\'s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire . \nevery set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture . \nwilder\'s script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness . \nwilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film . \nwilder\'s is dead wrong when he says nobody\'s perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny . \nnobody\'s perfect but billy wilder . \n'",1
"b""accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n""",1

"b""it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\x12s movies or novels , you must \x13suspend disbelief . \x14 \nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \neven if you can ignore these somewhat \x13white\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\x12s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\x12t gel . \nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\x12t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \x13goodies versus baddies , \x14 there are numerous twists in it\x12s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\x12s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \nhard rain\x12s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\x12s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\x12t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\x12t handle anything else . \ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\x12t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \n""",0

"b'with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . \nhollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . \nand good characters . . . \nand good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . \nand for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . \nthe closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . \nnow comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . \nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . \nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . \nusing this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . \nunfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . \nsince seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . \nlately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . \nmost people don\'t even realize that it is a film . \ndespite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . \nniccol\'s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . \ngattaca begins in the 21st century . \nprocreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . \nnatural child birth is considered old-fashioned . \nwe are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . \none of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . \nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . \nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . \nhowever , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . \nas a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . \nanton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . \nvincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . \nlabeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent\'s dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . \ngerman introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . \njerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca\'s tight security . \nin exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . \nafter the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent\'s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . \nirene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . \ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . \nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . \nunfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . \nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . \nthe orange glow of gattaca\'s scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . \nthe sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . \nas we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren\'t too far into the future . \nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . \nthe best thing , however , is the plot . \nthe story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . \nat its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . \nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . \nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? \nmaybe human nature is a result of mankind\'s flaws . \nif we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? \nniccol\'s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . \nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . \nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol\'s part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . \nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . \nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and "" valid "" peers . \numa thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . \nher character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn\'t about her . \nhowever , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . \njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . \nhe provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . \nloren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . \ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . \nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . \nstill , he does a good job . \ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . \ngattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . \ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn\'t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . \nit turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . \nif this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . \nhowever , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn\'t talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . \ninstead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . \nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?

"b""the thirteenth floor is a bland , obligatory exercise in genre film-making . \nif i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture . \ncraig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall , the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) . \neverything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one , and characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level . \nthe acting is okay , but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of , and features a script ( co-penned by director josef rusnak ) loaded with cliches and stock characters . \nthere are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree . \nproducer roland emmerich , based on this and his previous directorial efforts , seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science-fiction . \n""",0
"b'every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . \nsuch is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . \ndespite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . \nyou probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . \nwill hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . \nhe likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . \nhe ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . \nafter getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . \nafter outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . \nin the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . \nthe story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . \neven though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . \nalas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . \nthe one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . \nis it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? \nof course . \nis it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? \nusually , yes . \nbut , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? \nnot very likely . \ncome on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school \ngirls . \nwill is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . \nthe heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . \nall this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . \ndamon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . \nwhich leads me to the really good part of the review . \nthe strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . \ni can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . \nfrom minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . \nrobin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . \nthe real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . \nthe scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . \nwhen i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . \nwatching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . \ngus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . \ni highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . \ndespite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . \n'",1
"b'do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ? \ndo you ? \nwell , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring . \nunfortunately , there\'s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves . \na checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo\'s character abby relates to it well . \nlike a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that . \nmeanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman . . . \numa being the only woman\'s name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies . \nas abby tells her , "" you burp and they think it\'s cute . \nyou barf and they line up to hold your hair back .

"b'i don\'t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it\'s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \ni can\'t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i\'m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \nsince birth , he\'s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \nall the people in truman burbank\'s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \npeople watch truman\'s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman\'s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \neven if you haven\'t seen the truman show , you\'ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \nif anything i\'ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you\'ll probably think it sucks . \nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial "" eat me "" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \nbut weird things start happening . \na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman\'s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he\'s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he\'d ever do is hurt him . \nas truman\'s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \nthere\'s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman\'s existence . \nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \nhe\'s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \nmost fundamentally , it\'s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person\'s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the \'90s has been reality programming and jerry springer\'s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it\'s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \nbut merge the two and you\'ve got the truman show . \nright now , it\'s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won\'t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they\'d let you broadcast every detail of a man\'s life to the entire world without his consent ? \none day , though , it could happen . \nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \nyou know they would . \n'",1
"b'cashing in on the success of white men can\'t jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success . \nsadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven\'t got a chance in hell of even coming close . \nthis time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . \nfollowing several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the "" money train "" --a train which carries all the subway\'s takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there\'s * an original plot device ) , harrelson\'s character decides to try and take off with the cash . \nalong the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss . \nthis leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( \'you were always the better brother\' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn\'t help to add anything to the film . \ngiven a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time . \nrobert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history ! \nhe sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets ! \nbut this is only one of money train\'s problems . \nif you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense . \nbut if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse . \nthe final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain\'t butch and sundance . \nthe film isn\'t all bad though . \nsnipes and harrelson , when they aren\'t using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent . \nbut good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie . \nif you\'re a really undemanding action freak , there\'s a chance you\'ll like this . \nbut if you\'re looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you\'ll find it here . \n'",0
"b'since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller "" blood simple , "" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . \ntheir films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . \nin "" the big lebowski , "" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning "" fargo , "" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . \nthe dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood\'s most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . \nthe dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . \nhe has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . \nhe smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . \none day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . \nthe main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . \nsuffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . \nby the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski\'s daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in "" fargo .
