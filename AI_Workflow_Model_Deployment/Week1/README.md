# Data at scale: Through the Eyes of Our Working Example

## THE DESIGN THINKING PROCESS:

The Prototype phase of the design thinking process is where ideas are tested in real-life to see if they work in solving business challenges. The Prototype phase is about making a model work. At this stage, you’ll be developing and tweaking many different models, all in an attempt to select the best model for the job.

You’ll also learn about the non-linear aspects of design thinking. As you create and test prototype models you will probably discover that you don’t have all of the data or user insights that you need. Recall that design thinking is user-centric. As your users engage with your models they will come up with more suggestions and ideas for making your models more useful. During the earliest stages of prototyping you’ll be building new data pipelines and new models, testing your abilities every day.

## Connecting the Dots:

Some business opportunities can be solved by running a tuned model once on all available data. For example, if AAVAIL was interested in whether or not to continue investing in a particular market, a time-series forecasting model could be created for both the new market and a baseline. This model, along with some visualizations and additional analysis, would likely be compiled into a report and there would be no need for it to exist in a persistent state with callable endpoints. Ideally, the forecasting model would be written in way that would allow it to be easily adopted to other market analyses.

Depending on the needs of your business, it is possible that a sizable percentage of models exist as standalone projects that would provide little added value if they were deployed. It is also possible that nearly all models need to be deployed in production to be of benefit to the business. Either way it is likely that model deployment will become a necessity at some point and optimization is a key consideration for any model or service that is to be deployed.
